0,euyw97v,Brad Pitt tripping on acid pointing the finger gun at Tex was my favorite movie scene in a long time!
1,euz6ywt,"“More than a brother but not quite a wife.”

That’s the take away line of the film for me."
2,euys7gs,"That scene where DiCaprio tells himself he won’t drink, then proceeds to chug out of the flask and spits it out? I felt that."
3,euyrqkr,"That scene at the ranch when Cliff was going in to check on George Spahn was so fucking tense. Even the music from the TV was foreboding as hell.

And holy shit, I didn't even realize that was Dakota Fanning. Totally didn't recognize her."
4,euywabz,"I am so, so glad that there wasn’t any acrimony between Cliff and Rick. A surprisingly wholesome take on male friendship."
5,euyril8,Jesus fucking Christ Tarantino loves feet
6,euz2y6i,"I loved that Rick told Cliff that he was ""One pool party away from a big break"" and Rick ended up burning the final Manson girl IN THE POOL to finally get friendly with Sharon Tate and her friends"
7,euyqpg9,Brandy is a good girl
8,euz9vr7,Tarantino wants us to know that extremely attractive women snore
9,euz8t4k,"Brad and Leo had some great commentary watching his scene in FBI
“Thats a great leap”
“That guys a fucking prick”"
10,euyuipb,"The whole set up of Cliff having the flashback of why Kurt Russell’s character didn’t want to cast him was pure gold.

“Fair enough.”"
11,euzcfrk,"I was genuinely nervous for Cliff's well being in those final scenes. Not often a film does this for me, and for that reason alone this was an awesome experience. Enjoyed it a lot."
12,euz7t0x,"When Cliff chucked the dog food can at her face then told the police that Tex was talking about “Devil shit”, I had tears in my eyes from laughing"
13,ev1o24o,"In this thread, I’ve seen a lot of people talking about Pitt’s performance. And don’t get me wrong, him killing hippies while tripping on acid is an all-time Tarantino scene...but this is a top 3 DiCaprio performance. The insecure TV star in the back half of his career is just pure gold...and there are at least 3 scenes that I found myself dumbstruck by his performance. The scene by himself in the trailer after he breaks; the conversation with the little girl about his novel (and what a performance by her as well); and the final climactic scene (flame thrower and “Well, the fucking hippies ain’t, I’ll tell you that). Just a masterclass from DiCaprio. He’s the best we’ve got."
14,euyq8kz,Imagine stopping the Manson murders while on acid.
15,euz9mys,I need a Rick Dalton spaghetti western movie poster more than anything.
16,euyqpfj,An hour of this movie is Brad Pitt driving around LA
17,ev0fa6f,This movie really showcased how great of an actor Leo is. The scene where he throws the girl actually made me forget what movie I was watching.
18,euyut2b,"“Are you real?”

“I’m as real as a motherfucking donut!”"
19,ev3rtia,"(Paraphrasing)

“More than a brother, not quite a wife.”

“Thank you for bringing Pussycat home. We love pussy.”
“Yes, we do.”

“The redhead out front?”
“I just told you I’m fucking blind. How should I know what color head she is?”

“If you don’t nail those lines, I’m gonna blow your fucking brains out.”

“I’m the devil, and I’m here to do the devil’s business.”
“...Naw, it wasn’t something dumber than that.”

“Is everyone alright?”
“The hippies ain’t, that’s for fuckin’ sure.”

“These hands are registered as lethal weapons. We get in a fight, I accidentally kill you... I go to jail.”
“Anybody gets in a fight and accidentally kills anybody, they go to jail. It’s called manslaughter.”

“Don’t cry in front of the Mexicans.”

“He said he was the devil... said he was there to do... Devil shit.”"
20,euypt6p,Did they just say one of the Italian movies was directed by our boy Antonio?
21,euywpi3,That was the longest most expensive set up for a punchline I've ever seen.
22,euypzi7,Rick walking out with the flamethrower at the end was amazing
23,ev7wmh4,"“Hey, can you do something bout the heat?”

“Rick.... its a flamethrower”

💀"
24,euzkns0,[deleted]
25,euyq3wg,I really expected the climax to be Sharon Tate's murder. I was happily surprised by Brad's brutal beatdown. (triple alliteration btw)
26,euyqe2e,"Bruce Lee: ""**HI-YA**!""

Cliff: ʰᶦ⁻ʸᵃ"
27,euzi7tz,“don’t cry in front of the mexicans”
28,euz703f,Tim Roth (Cut)
29,euyxc82,I loved that Sharon Tate’s real performance was used in the movie clips. It was a very nice touch. RIP Sharon.
30,euystnz,"I gotta say, definitely taken aback when the hippie girl offered to suck Cliff off while he drove her home. And he asks to know if shes 18. Obviously she wasn't. Cliff was such an interesting character. Not saying Rick wasnt, just Cliff seemed more entertaining"
31,euzhdg8,"The most satisfying use of Chekhov’s Gun I’ve ever seen in film.

That whole ending was a riot in the best way possible. Please go see it with a packed opening weekend crowd."
32,euys8i7,Add Cliff Booth to the ever-growing list of Tarantino characters that are just straight up fucking *cool*
33,ev37umo,"The more I think about it, the more I like it."
34,ev160jf,Was anyone else really entertained by Leo's Italian wife at the end? Especially when she punched the Manson girl.
35,euz0g9f,I can't believe there was a shot of Cliff getting stuff out of his trunk and we didn't get a camera shot from inside the trunk!
36,euzs9xu,You aint giving my man Cliff Booth road head without showing your ID first.
37,ev3jsa3,This movie further solidifies that Brad Pitt and Tarantino are a match made in heaven.
38,euz7xzl,How is nobody talking about the little girl on the movie set with Leo? I thought that scene was awesome and she plays the part really well
39,ev32tyb,"The bad ass cowboy burst into tears and had to be consoled by an 8 year old girl.

The movie built suspense for 20 minutes around a murder that never took place.

The movie was amazing."
40,euyucei,That ranch scene with Cliff was intense. Tarantino would make a fucking awesome horror movie.
41,euyw51k,"Brad Pitt plays ""cool, quiet, confidence"" so perfectly.

Any other actor would come off as smug or unlikable but he's so darn charming and fun."
42,euypmp7,"“Oh my god, is everyone okay?”  

“Well the fucking hippies ain’t.”  
  

That third act was the most Tarantino shit I’ve ever seen........ and I loved every minute of it."
43,euzmlc9,"“My booze doesn’t need a buddy”

I C O N I C"
44,euzt0e9,"**Easy Breezy** was the most badass cowboy in the land, until he took a bad fall and hurt his *hip*.

They made it clear to show us few times at the end that **Cliff Booth** was stabbed...in the *hip*.

Cliff Booth was Easy Breezy in the long run, and the true cowboy of the film.

Fucking genius."
45,euypxef,"This is the all time peak we have in foot fetish cinema. Bravo, Tarantino."
46,ev361t0,"No one seems to be mentioning the Rick Dalton/Clint Eastwood parallels. 

Eastwood spent 8 years on the tv western Rawhide. His career was at a standstill when that series ended. He then went to Europe and resurrected his career in spaghetti westerns. Came home and struck gold with Dirty Harry."
47,euyq8fs,Holy shit. When Rick ran to the tool shed to grab the flamethrower to burn Sadie. Did not expect that. The last act was hilarious
48,euyrt78,"I I know I just saw the film, but that absolute beat down that the Manson family got in the third act might be my favorite Tarantino scene."
49,euyufrk,"I really loved the whole Spahn Ranch scene. Cliff pushing his way into their place without knowing how much of a threat they are really put me on the edge of my seat. Really felt like shit could’ve popped off any moment.  That being said, I wish we got more of Damon Herriman as Manson besides just the one scene, was really looking forward to his performance."
50,euyqau1,"> After Credits Scene? No

This is wrong. There absolutely is a mid-credits scene that is worth sticking around for.

Edit: It's fixed."
51,ev18lax,"""I am the devil and I'm here to do the devil's work.""

""Naw, it was dumber than that."""
52,euywqhn,"The discussion about the role of violence in Tarantino's world and the criticism he faces for it in the media have a cheeky rebuke from Tarantino in this movie. 


At one point when Booth is driving the radio has a small segment about the Kennedy assassination and how it was the work of a truly deranged and dangerous person. One of the Tate murderers tries to justify their actions with a narrative that Tarantino's IRL critics have tried to take that the violence in media is what has taught them to be murders however Sebring and Tate are also big fans of Dalton's fake Hollywood violence and are perfectly normal people who enjoy it as the fiction it is.

 This makes a distinction that the worst violence is carried out by sick and demented people like the Tate murderers and fictional violence has little to no role in making them the terrible people that they were. (A similar parallel to me IRL is how the Columbine killers happen to be fans of violent video games and music, not that it made them violent) I imagine it was no coincidence that the particular murderer who tries to justify it is the one who gets the spectacular death by flamethrower."
53,euyqq1q,"This film really felt like it was all about placing the audience in the world it creates, and in that sense it is a master class. My only complaint is that I would have liked a bit more of a narrative thrust to enjoy. All in all I can't fault the film that much and enjoyed it just fine."
54,euyskl1,Brad Pitt stole the movie in my opinion. He was able to emote so well with what seemed like so little. It really reminded me of that old-school type of protagonist. Very James Dean-ish which given the subject matter of the film is probably intentional on Tarantino’s part
55,euys3e6,"Manson's forgettable cameo was intentional.

Tarantino didnt wanna pay the character any screen time outside of a boring uneventful scene."
56,euz9gfw,Quentin’s next movie will be about preventing 9/11
57,euz4mcq,"Regardless of how much money this movie makes, who gets awards, or how divisive it will be. It was so nice to sit and watch an original movie that I didn’t know where it would take me. So refreshing during the summer blockbuster season. And not having to see a Hobbs and Shaw trailer beforehand was the cherry on top."
58,euyvu8p,Man...just give Brad Pitt the best supporting Oscar.
59,euzbm81,Was that Uma Thurman’s daughter at the end of the movie?
60,euzgxyk,That little girl is a very good actress. Most child actors aren’t that convincing and she shared the screen with Leo suprisingly well.
61,ev3o1c2,Anyone notice that right before the Manson family comes to their houses at the end the guy in Sharon Tate’s house turns on he TV and the guy on TV says “And here is the moment you’ve all been waiting for.” A little meta line that I thought was fun.
62,euzi200,"When Brad Pitt was about to fight Bruce Lee.



 >""That guy's kinda famous.""

>""What for?""

>""He killed his wife and got away with it.""

>:|



This movie was hilarious, and I absolutely loved it."
63,euz9opi,"I thought GTA V was just a videogame, or that Quentin doubled down on it. Things include: drive around around LA listening to the radio, pick up prostitutes, engulf in flames your opponents by your multimillion dollar mansion poolside."
64,euz5vo0,"I adored the backdrop of this movie. The streets of LA that have been converted to look like the ‘60’s are just stunning. The shots of Brad Pit driving in his car are gorgeous, especially the nighttime shots. The production design and sets are also great. I know it’s largely to be expected, but it’s just a beautiful movie."
65,euyuhnz,Our theater lost their shit when he walked in with the flamethrower lmfao
66,euyrjzj,Holy shit that third act was absolutely phenomenal. I also really appreciate how tasteful Tarantino was with Sharon Tate.
67,euzy3lp,That whole ranch scene gave me the heebie jeebies
68,euz5d9i,I've never done acid but I absolutely loved the way Brad Pitt played that experience. I swear he is actually one of the funniest actors out there.
69,euznf9n,Brad Pitt chucking Bruce Lee into a car is one of my favorite movie moments of 2019
70,euzka8s,[deleted]
71,euz0yh7,"Didn’t think any kill could top John Wicks library kill this year but Brad Pitt heavily injuring the girl with a can of dog food, then having his dog munch on her and having Leo finish her off with a flamethrower is the best kill in cinema I have seen in my life.  Not to mention the loud clank noise in Dolby Atmos sounded so nice"
72,euzklfr,When Brad Pitt fucking yeeted the dog food can at that chick's head I just about died.
73,euyr1b0,"I did not expect the funniest movie scene this year to be the Manson murders. Also I think Tarantino should be applauded for making a movie essentially about the Manson family,or at least heavily to do with them, and only barely having Charles Manson in the movie"
74,euyr0eg,"This might have my favorite Brad Pitt performance of all time, and a great one from Leo too. But the best scene to me was Sharon Tate watching her own movie. That exuded such pure heart and charm. That scene alone to me was enough to see the critiques about Sharon Tate's lack of dialogue in this movie were kind of bs, not to mention her generally being the heart of the movie."
75,euyvah6,The girl Rick impresses on set is so goddamn good. Love that scene.
76,ev0ri4x,I love how Rick Fuckin Daltons first instinct when a stranger falls into his pool is to grab a flamethrower he has chilling in his pool shed and torch the shit out of them
77,euz6xvt,"Definitely need to see this again but my initial take away is this really felt like an homage to Sharon Tate. The way Robbie is shot throughout almost feels like she moves in her own orbit almost in slow motion compared to the other characters. The scenes where Tate is watching herself in The Wrecking Crew, using the actual footage of Tate instead of superimposing Robbie or re-shooting the scenes with Robbie, really romanticized the era and Tate specifically. I can't even really express right now the dread I felt leading up to the finale. Obviously Tarantino has no problem reinventing history but I really didn't know what to expect. It almost felt sickening imagining what was just around the corner, only for it to end the way it did. Which was incredibly enjoyable yet bittersweet at the same time. Also DiCaprio and Pitt were both phenomenal. I could easily see these two as serious contenders come Oscar season."
78,ev0rvgw,"Brandy deserves a big, fat steak after eating those crazy hippies."
79,euyt29u,Brad Pitt acting high on acid while killing the Manson family members was absolutely  hilarious and absolutely brutal
80,ev3xof1,"""What was your name again?""

""I am the Devil. Come to do the devil's bidding""

""...Naw. It was stupider than that.""

I have never genuinely laughed harder at a line in cinema than that one. Bravo Cliff. Bravo Quentin."
81,ev310yl,People keep complaining about Sharon Tates presense in the movie. Sharon Tate was in the film to torment us because she was supposed to be tortured and killed in a most heinous way. The twist at the end was how the real scenario should have panned out.  It's a fairy tell that we all knew the ending to but got the ending we really wanted.  The murderers got what they deserved and that's what we wish happened in real life. DiCaprio's acting was amazing.  He and Tarentino make a great team.  He was so scary in Django.
82,euyr5vq,The scene with Sharon Tate watching her own movie in the theatre and being happy people are laughing at her scene was one of the best things I’ve seen. I also loved how they showed her training with Bruce for her scene to show she’s dedicated to her craft. Absolutely beautiful
83,euywgpe,"One small detail I loved about the film: I figured Pacino's character would be the typical anti-semitic Jewish agent character you always see in these movies. He wasn't : he was a good agent, he gave good advice to his client, genuinely cared about him, (he even watched his FBI) and more than fulfilled his promises to get him some parts on Italian films. 

I liked how he explained the pro-wrestling model of putting someone over to Rick- he understood the business, he wasn't just some out of touch old greedy sleazebag."
84,euz1j2n,The theatre was *howling* when Rick walked out of his shed
85,euyqq2k,Slow burn of a movie until the end. Flamethrower fans rejoice.
86,euywfnl,"So I was actually getting invested into the western show they were making. Had me laughing when he explained to the cops ""he's saying he is  the devil"""
87,euzux6o,"Rick on Cliff: ""Hell, you can hit him with a fuckin' Lincoln!""

Cliff to Bruce Lee: \*Throws him into a Lincoln\*"
88,euzfbrv,Cliff Booth is this generations The Dude. Except Cliff can seriously fuck you up when he’s tripping on acid. Easily one of the best Tarantino scenes of all time!
89,euys37v,I feel so conflicted. Did I actually like the movie? Was it actually one movie or was the first 2/3 one movie and the last 1/3 totally a different one? Was the ending rushed? Was all the extra footage in the beginning necessary? Was it even good? I'm baffled. I think I need to watch it again. I tried so hard to catch little details throughout the film that I think I wore my eyeballs out.
90,ev8cpgc,"What a fun night for Brandy! A nice walk, good dinner, chew up some hippies and then got to cuddle with Fancesca. What a good girl."
91,euywwbw,"The man likes feet, dirty feet."
92,euz9ddj,I honestly feel the 3rd act would have such little meaning if you went into the movie without any hint of knowledge regarding the real events.
93,euzxxlx,"I think this film will be a super controversial one but I think this is just how Quentin Tarantino is using his trope of rewritten history to give the movie a whole new level of meaning that’s never been done before.

 It seems like Margot Robbie’s character does nothing but I think she’s the most important part for that new, experimental dimension of the film. Going into it you know she’s supposed to die (at least in real life) so you watch waiting for clues that lead to her death but you really just see her living life because in real life, that’s how it went. There wasn’t clues. She was just living her life and then everything ends abruptly. She’s got a bunch of things going for her, and thinking about her as a human, it’s actually really nice to see a girl doing well in her industry and being able have all the things she ever wanted: Fame, fortune, being loved by the public.  And the idea that she might die the whole time makes it seem a little grim. But when she doesn’t die, and everything ends up going well for everyone, like how cliff got redemption for what he’s done, Rick dalton got his role with the hot young director, and Sharon Tate gets to live, there’s a sense of relief because it ends with a pleasant, happy ending— contrary to real life. 

The fact of it having a happy ending is kind of referenced in the title- once upon a time in Hollywood. This is like a fairytale opening. Not only does it foreshadow a happy ending but also has statement of how this doesn’t happen in real life. It’s a fairytale. I think a lot of people will not get it because for most movies, they exist in a vacuum. Everything in the movie usually is all you should  need to understand it but I think Tarantino tries to break that status quo by writing this story to be paired with the real historical events. The way that real life’s not so happy ending foils the movie’s happy ending adds a new level of depth that’s confusing because of how unexplored and and on the frontier of the art it is. When you look at Sharon Tate’s happy life in the movie and realize what actually happened, you start to feel sad for her and how her life could have gone. From the one dimensional view on everything that happened in the movie it is a seemingly confusing plot, but because of the way history effects the meaning of the events, there is a whole new level of depth that has barely if ever been explored intentionally in a well known piece of literature.

The idea that it was meant to be paired with the real story gives his rewriting history a purpose other than to be a part of the story. In this movie he isn’t just rewriting a history to make his universe different from real life, its to have a commentary and provide a new perspective on real life events that looks past the crazy, scandalous narrative. The way this foil calls attention to the fact that it’s just a story makes you realize that all these good things didn’t get to happen to real people and that what really did happen is much sadder. Everything actually came out for the worst. 

This may be a completely new device  that we’re watching unfold and it may have been what Tarantino intended to do with inglourious basterds but we were all too dazzled by the brilliant storytelling, cinematography, acting, editing, writing, and directing of to be able to see, but it makes me really want to rewatch both inglourious basterds and once upon a time in Hollywood so I can see through this lens again, this time while watching.

I give it a 10/10 for this bold experiment and everything else was phenomenal too"
94,euziqfu,"This might sound insane but this was my FIRST Tarantino movie! 

I know that sounds fucking insane but I was too young to have taken his movies seriously. 

So, this was a fucking RIOT and I loved the Brad Pitt scenes at the end. My sides hurt watching that whole sequence. 

Gonna go watch it again just for that final act.

I do think the first 2 hours were kinda slow (still hilarious dialogue) but that seemed intentional with how bonkers the last 20 minutes were.

and OMG Margot Robbie was so cute"
95,ev3orox,[deleted]
96,euyqukf,"Love it when Tarantino rewrites history to let the good guys fuck up the horrible people of our past, and the Manson family totally deserved every punch, kick, stab and flamethrower. What a fucking ending..."
97,euyz6k7,And awaaaay we go
98,ev9tc1n,"I loved, loved, loved the twist ending. 

I was dreading the climax because of what I thought it would depict—the horrific, senseless murder of a sweet, innocent pregnant woman and her friends. Showing her graphic murder in film would have been like killing her again, revictimizing her in grisly torture porn-like fashion. 

Instead of inflating the glory of some cowardly murderers, Tarantino chose to show just how pathetic they were. He refused to gratify the people out there who still idolize the Manson family. We get to see what should have happened, and as the movie ends, Sharon Tate is happily inviting her friends and neighbor into her home.

She may not have had that chance in real life, but at least we got to see her happy ending in a big, star-studded movie. I left the theater with a feeling of lightness mixed with melancholy. It was a bittersweet fairy tale. 

I also appreciated that neither Charles Manson nor Roman Polanski got much screen time or focus. 

Finally, the young girl who played Leo’s costar on set was awesome. She was the highlight of the first half of the movie for me.

EDIT: Whaaaat thank you /u/milfof2queens !!!"
99,euzlyuh,The whole damn movie I kept thinking “please don’t let Cliff get caught in a shootout”
100,ev1zyg1,"I've seen some complaints about how laidback and simple the movie is up until the final act, and although I see where they're coming from I loved it. It's been quite a while since a Tarantino movie felt so patient and character driven (at least since Jackie Brown, I would say, but maybe never?). This isn't a movie that's constantly showing off or rushing to hit plot points. The large majority of the events of the movie take place in one afternoon! Three complete little stories are told in one afternoon.

\- Practically the entirety of Dalton's plot up until the final act is him shooting a single TV episode. He gets to the lot, he gets into costume, has a few drinks, has a meaningful convo with a little girl, struggles shooting one scene and then knocks another scene out of the park. That's it! But from those few simple events a full story is told. He begins the day uncertain about his talent and future career. He shows up hungover/drunk, wanders around while being treated like a working actor rather than a star, and takes a moment to fantasize about a big break he never got (that scene from the Great Escape). He has that conversation with the young actress where he gets emotional about being a has-been and then has a lot of trouble remembering his lines when he shoots the episode, showing how heavily that is weighing on him. He has a mini-breakdown in his trailer but manages to psych himself up enough to nail the final scene with Luke Perry. And he gets vindicated as an actor with talent when the producer guy and the young actress tell him how great of a job he did. So we have Dalton walking into an uncertain situation, struggling with his obsolescence, running into a serious professional crisis and then managing to turn it around and prove to himself that he has worth. It's a full emotional journey in a simple afternoon. Add in the subtle, never-discussed detail about Dalton having a stutter (and think about how much more hard work he would have put into his career) and you have a really well-rounded character.

\- Sharon Tate does even less! She picks up a hitchhiker, goes to buy a book for her husband and then goes to see a movie she was in. But Tarantino accomplishes so much with these simple little scenes. We see how generous and kind she is (she strikes up an immediate friendship with the hitchhiker and goes to buy a gift for her husband just because), how unpretentious she is (see how polite she is with the theatre staff and how she just kind of adorably dances around everywhere she goes) and how she's clearly in an early ""honeymoon"" stage of her career where she's still not used to the idea that she's famous. Add in how radiant Margot Robbie is and you just fall in love with her immediately. It adds an emotional factor to the inherent tension in knowing about her real-life murder and makes you really want her to get out alive. It's because of this portrayal of Tate that this movie feels like Tarantino's most tender and sweet film: the movie almost feels structured around giving her the happy ending she never got in reality.

\- There's more to Cliff's story because it's setting up him as a badass and he's our conduit into the Manson family but Tarantino still takes his time with him. Tons of long scenes of him aimlessly driving around LA, which immerses us into the world of the film, and that long scene where he comes home and preps a meal for him and his dog. We learn so much about him just by panning around his trailer, making him feel like a human being rather than purely a super badass movie character. That and Pitt is just so effortlessly charismatic.

So for me the patient pacing of the movie is one of its strongest features. I loved just hanging around and getting to know these people and it made the ending that much more impactful."
101,ew86kki,"I think Tarantino hates the Manson family even more more than he hates Nazis. You can tell how much he relished the opportunity to give them insanely gruesome and protracted deaths. But considering how much he loves Hollywood and this era in American history, it makes sense that he completely despises the people who did so much to kill the counterculture and the innocence of Hollywood that he remembers from his childhood. 

The fact that the people who actually stop the Mansons are Hollywood professionals is key to the point of the film. If Basterds and Django were revenge fantasies about Jewish people and slaves inflicting retribution against Nazis and slave owners, then this is his revenge fantasy about Hollywood itself getting retribution against the Mansons."
102,ev7yo0h,"Brad Pitt’s deadpan delivery is on another level.

His comedic timing in general. Wow."
103,euzeihm,Did anyone notice the weird cut between when Leo was talking to Timothy Olyphant? Where it suddenly cut from Timothy without a hat to with one?
104,euzzbz1,This movie was like watching someone play GTA who mostly just cruises around exploring for 3 hours.
105,euzashv,"So did anyone pick up on the fact that Cliff’s wife was named Natalie? 

This has to be a reference to the [suspicions](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natalie_Wood)  that Robert Wagner killed his wife Natalie Wood on a boat.

Edit: typo"
106,ev31qjs,Dont cry in front of the Mexicans...
107,ev8zvu5,"Maybe I'm reaching here, but I had a thought and I want to share it.

When Rick is first on the set of Lancer and he's talking to the super intense 8 year old method actor, he badly describes the story of western novel he's reading.

In the novel, the bronc buster (which is historically an interesting profession by itself, filled with both charlatans and real quiet professionals [and also one of the most difficult careers a man could have in the west]) is supposed to be a real, honest to goodness tough as nails cowboy. But then, he takes a fall and hurts his **hip.** Rick says that he ""doesn't become a cripple or anything"" but that he's kind of messed up and just stops being as useful as he used to be.

Rick, the movie cowboy, obviously identifies with the character and has an emotional reaction. He has a hard time coping with the fact that he's not as good as he used to be, but he takes that and pulls his movie career together and moves forward.

Meanwhile, Cliff, the actual cowboy (or, the closest thing to a cowboy left in Hollywood) is *really good* at a difficult and demanding job that nobody appreciates, but he just wants the chance to work. As he says in the beginning of the movie, his job is to (I'm going to paraphrase) ""Carry Rick's load."" He carries Rick and Rick's crap, literally and figuratively, throughout the entire movie, until the climax where Cliff takes one last fall for Rick, where he injures his hip in a way that will almost certainly make him unable to work or be ""as useful"" as he once was.

For years, Cliff is basically just Rick's shadow until the moment where Cliff crosses over and gets to be the real hero one more time and he does so without any desire for attention or praise. He moves into his useless period with grace and tact, unlike Rick who suffers from constant emotional turmoil.

There's probably more to write and I could have said that better, but whatever. I just think the connection between the hip injuries is interesting, as are the parallels between the life Rick pretends to have and the life Cliff actually has.

I saw a number of articles about how this movie is supposedly about the Manson murders, or Sharon Tate, or whatever else. It's not really about any of those things. I think they're just convenient props for the set- and there's nothing wrong with that. Movies crib from reality all the time, and that little dose of reality is something that makes many films much better. The movie is really about the two men coming to terms with the end of their utility, especially in a way that coincides with the ends of what they represent.

One could make the argument that Rick represents the end of the TV and movie Western era, while Cliff represents the end of the actual American West. While Rick leaves with a whimper, Cliff sinks into the background but maintains his pride and his dignity.

Also, a fun fact, the dog that played Becky got an award for her performance, making her not only a good doggo, but an award-winning doggo. In true Tarantino fashion, he alluded to having difficulties with her on set, but was amazed by the quality of her performance while editing. I'm surprised that there were no closeups of the dog's feet.

Also, I thought the Ray Bradbury ""The Illustrated Man"" reference was interesting. The collection of short stories is framed by a man who is captivated by the tattoos that move around a man's body, telling stories in the process.

Ray Bradbury also had a deep love of 1950s and 60's Hollywood. Despite his warnings about mass media and television consumption, Bradbury wrote lovingly about California and Hollywood in a number of stories."
108,ev3qy6i,"Love the fact that Uma Thurman’s daughter was the Manson to nope out of there at the end. Complete opposite of her mom’s roles in QT’s movies.  

And love that she got a part in general."
109,ev3ltru,"When Cliff goes into the tool shed, you can see the flamethrower against the wall and I knew it would come back in a big way. Rick walking to the shed made me lose it. What a great scene. I was crying. 

Also, as a kid who grew up watching the western channel with my dad, they fucking nailed the over the top western bits. For those who feel like 2/3rds of the movie is a waste, you are missing this connection. The constant spitting, the “ding” of the spittoon. The dusty, musty saloon with the dusty haze showing beat to shit tables and chairs. The delivery of the lines in such a stereotypical western way. The iconic shot of the stairs above the bar. There were a lot of homages to classic westerns that I grew up on and I fucking loved it. 

Along with this we have a fantastic love letter to Sharon Tate. Margot was perfect playing a giddy actress who just wanted to make people laugh. Such a great tribute. 

Then, Cliff. The badass cool dude who bodied Bruce Lee into a car. The guy who might’ve killed his wife with a harpoon gun for talking too much, who asks a god damn hippie her age after being offered road head. What a perfect character. 

And then of course Leo was awesome as well. Rick Fucking Dalton standing with a pitcher of margaritas in hand cussing out a carload of hippies at 12am in a cul-de-sac was perfect and felt too relatable (god damn fucking kids). “I pay up the ass in property taxes for this shit?!” 

I loved it. I laughed a ton and it was a fucking fun movie. So many great moments."
110,euyuyjy,Something stupid.... like rex
111,ev7houe,"If you need huge plot points to occur to like a movie, then this will not be for you. If you can appreciate all the artful points of theater, then I think you can really enjoy this."
112,euz0ur6,"Tarantino has mastered the anticlimax and his villains are so entertaining and damn right hilarious. Also, Ricks breakdown in the trailer scene was awesome. 9/10"
113,ev6upns,"When Sharon Tate and friends went to the El Cayote Mexican restaurant, they point out the adult theater down the street is having a premiere.

That theater is now The New Beverly Cinema, the theater Quentin Tarantino owns, which was a porn theater in the 60s and 70s."
114,euyrwk4,Brad Pitt for me stole the entire show. Everything about his character was incredible and iconic as hell. Everything from his scene with Bruce Lee to the curb stomping to his mysterious past. Easily deserves his place in the pantheon of all time great Tarantino characters.
115,euz0pnz,"fucking loved that scene, burst out laughing. Brad killed it, when he revealed he bought an acid laced cigarette I knew it was going to come back to that full circle, and it paid off so well."
116,ev9mld5,"What was your name?

I’m the devil and I’m here to do the devil’s work!

...nnnnnnnnno it was something much dumber than that..."
117,ev4tg0u,"After seeing this, I could watch a 2hr 45 min movie of just Brad Pitt being on acid."
118,evatvv8,Mine was “Don’t cry in front of the Mexicans.”
119,ev6m4l5,[deleted]
120,euytf5w,Couldn’t stop at 3 whiskey sours? You fuckin had to have 8!
121,euz8mt1,[deleted]
122,ev3ekjf,"""You embarrassed yourself like that in front of all those god damn people!""

Me when I think about awkward shit I did in middle school that doesn't matter anymore."
123,euz9nbv,and all that for Spahn to be alive...  good twist from tarantino
124,euz07fl,That was Dakota Fanning?! Wow.
125,euzi67l,"Her close up & dialogue was kind of intense.. she fit the unhinged, barefoot cultist role that makes you feel uneasy down to the T."
126,euyx8by,"""Im one pool party away from starring in polansky's next film""

He made his own pool party!"
127,ev3uhji,"When he asks him if he wants to watch his ep of FBI, and Cliff already has a sixer in the back. Absolutely beamed at that part."
128,ev3oq6x,Yes! I just love how there was no cliche scene where either one was resentful of the other
129,ev6tns3,Their chemistry was great and they both nail their roles. Super entertaining to watch . They could easily make this into a 10 hour TV show
130,euyt6rz,"I think at this point he leans into it.  Fuck the first 40 minutes I was like, ""Goddamnit Tarantino!  I came here to see three things!  Lengthy dialogue, bloody violence and FEET!"""
131,ev199fp,"I took my sister to see this movie. She has never seen a Tarantino movie before and doesn't know anything about him. Even she was like ""What was with all the feet!?"" after we walked out of the theater."
132,ev3o5m5,"The shot of the feet pressed up against the car windshield had my friends and I rolling. Like, I guess that foot-fetish joke is so well-known at this point that all he can do is lean into it."
133,ev19mf5,[deleted]
134,euyt9jy,What a good dog she would be
135,euyv20z,She had the nastiest food lol
136,euza3dx,brandy stole the damn show
137,evatrh1,I was so worried the dog was gonna die
138,ev1jpm5,The set up scene showing how well trained she is was so out of place... I thought at first until the end
139,euzosmq,I’m pretty sure the dog was a good boy though.
140,ev0gw2s,Funny how that’s Kurt Russell’s song in Guardians of the Galaxy 2
141,euzel2h,And also have dirty fucking feet
142,ev0i3kb,"My wife snores, so I felt that."
143,euzgxp9,Should be a commentary track on the Blu-ray with them in character
144,ev22i4t,"QT has said he’s written a number of fake Rick Dalton episodes. Fuck, I’d kill to see them with their commentary."
145,euz94bq,"""I love that shot""

I liked that comment cuz I couldn't tell if he was referring to the camera angle with the broken windshield or the actual shot as in the bullet Leo's character had just fired."
146,euzg3yw,That scene was like 5 mins long and then it flashes back to cliff on the roof and I fucking lost it. I had no idea it was a flashback 😂😂
147,euzk714,Was him “killing” his wife supposed to connect to Natalie Wood somehow?
148,euzftbd,"I fully expected him to die, especially once he was stabbed I thought that was the end."
149,ev8f9zi,The entire movie was just building up the tension all the way to the end. I was fully expecting to have to watch the murders as they really happened. Instead we got one of the best cathartic releases I can remember.
150,ev3e3uh,"I thought they were gonna shoot DiCaprio and Brad Pitt would hear the shot and find him dying. 

Really glad it didn’t go there."
151,euzhwx7,"“They said they were doing... devil shit, not verbatim but still”"
152,ev17jvi,"To take the air out of such an iconic phrase used in real, horrible, brutal murders was fucking legendary"
153,ev1ekb6,Aaand away we go!
154,ev2obpr,"She got hit so fucking hard from that dog food, I was howling"
155,ev3x5sy,Then the Italian wife got a punch in there too lol
156,ev4hml8,I loved the small stutters and affectations he was doing throughout.  Really subtle but added so much to Rick's character.
157,ev1pgag,"This has been an incredible decade for Leo. 

Inception (Elevates the whole film) 
Shutter Island
Django (Incredible, underrated) 
Wolf of Wall Street (Gonna be an All-Timer)
The Revenant (Oscar)
And now this."
158,ev88mg5,The hardest thing I’ve ever tried to do is act like I’m acting. Leo put on a clinic for any aspiring actors. I’m speechless.
159,evb9tmt,"I loved the image of an angry drunk actor in the middle of the night holding a blender full of margarita and yelling at the Manson family to get the fuck out of his driveway, as much as if not more than Pitt's big beatdown.  And I just love that in this universe, the Manson murders were thwarted by these two dudes on the night that they both decided to get more buzzed than either of them had been in a while."
160,euyr4ut,I loved that it didnt start to kick in after he got back to Rick's house. That light scene was priceless
161,ev2qh6k,Brad Pitt has obviously done acid before because he got it spot on.
162,euzddzs,This was like the complete opposite of what happened to Brad in Burn After Reading.
163,ev0ikvb,Brad Pitt’s “Huh” as he watched the dog food plop into the bowl while fucked up on acid was the most Brad Pitt moment in the film.
164,euzqm24,As promo some of the posters were put up on Sunset Blvd in Hollywood
165,euyr9oo,"To be fair the driving scenes, especially the nighttime ones, were very well shot"
166,euzrxm0,When you live in LA a big part of your life becomes driving around it
167,ev0i7zn,"Also, who was that little girl actress? She was so good, especially in her conversation with Rick about his book."
168,ev123le,"and then the immediate genuine joy in his eyes when the little girl whispers ""that was the best acting i ever seen"""
169,ev15ob0,Better acting in that scene than anything in The Revenant in my opinion.
170,ev8d14d,"Honestly makes me wish Tarantino would do his own western series. That and Leo's delivery there was killer, he turned a spaghetti western trope into a genuinely scary and compelling villain. I'd watch that show."
171,ev3lp5x,"""I know you what's your name?""

""I'M THE FUCKING DEVIL""

""Naw, something dumber than that."""
172,euz71ef,Just the most perfect line for Cliff to hear while tripping
173,euyvwml,That line is so ridiculous and also super funny at the same time
174,ev3z3oz,"On that last line, “now...that’s not verbatim” hahaha"
175,evilemo,"When being offered a hit from the dipped acid cigarette.

“My booze don’t need no buddy” 

I love that line!"
176,euyqae5,Lol yup! Beyond the inglorious basterds reference Antonio Margheriti was actually an Italian Director
177,euyrtx1,MarGARettti
178,euz5cr4,Which scene?
179,euyr6o6,"That girl he torched, her acting was wild as well."
180,euytfch,The greatest use of Chekhov's Gun I've ever seen
181,euyqwhy,I was fucking dying lmao
182,euyrq8t,Our entire theater went nuts when he walked out with it. Absolutely incredible.
183,euyrl73,Might be in my top 5 favorite scenes Tarantino has directed.
184,euzlymf,The interview with the cops later had me in stitches
185,euyrcgk,Throwing the dog food can was fucking legendary
186,euyr56e,Brad popped the fuck off. It was insane lol
187,euys2ac,I had a good feeling Quentin wasn't going to end the movie on such a horrible note. This is the man who killed off Hitler in Inglorious Basterds after all.
188,euz3dz9,"Was there a reason that Bruce Lee was portrayed like that? He seemed like a complete jackass. Was this consistent with how others viewed him at the time, or just some word Tarantino flair?"
189,ev7mul2,That and the audio recording of Rick doing a stereotypical Mexican accent while practicing his lines were great
190,euz9bue,"Be cool, honey bunny"
191,ev2xqua,I lost my shit when I saw that.
192,euz9s3h,F
193,ev87fdv,Any reason why? Also I could be wrong but wasn't James Marsden also supposed to have a role?
194,ev3y4v6,"The guy behind me said to his wife ""That's the real Sharon Stone."""
195,ev3uq8s,"Loved how it showed the work that went into her fight scene, and then how pleased she was at the audience's enjoyment.

Showing Sharon in such a pure light is probably why her family was ok with this film."
196,euyv3gv,It’s almost a shot at Polanski.
197,evdzqgi,[deleted]
198,evb84ez,"I thought it was a way of establishing Cliff as old-school, not buying into the whole hippie movement, even when he has a hippie chick throwing herself at him."
199,euzih7g,"Please go see it...

...and bring bagels."
200,euyxn56,"Honestly I don't know who to credit more for making me absolutely love someone who likely killed his wife and got away with it, Pitt or Tarantino."
201,euzp16q,"also this: Based on a real friendship between stuntman Hal Needham and Burt Reynolds. As badass as it gets.

202,ev16w3i,I was losing it just watching the police officer stand there listening to her ramble on and on in Italian having no fucking clue what she was saying
203,ev8ko01,And then the way she shrieked and jumped before she ran away when the girl got up with the knife.
204,ev1yzdb,We should have shotguns for this job.
205,ev6cj1a,I’m surprised we didn’t have a Samuel L. Jackson cameo :/
206,ev392wi,"Prisons been trying to get me my whole life. When it finally does, it ain’t gonna be because of you."
207,ev28uyu,My boys got standards
208,euzhums,That was the best acting I’ve seen in my whole life
209,euz8pev,Julia Butters is awesome in American Housewife. She was great in this as well. One of the best child actors I have ever seen.
210,euz3it1,Those whip-pan tracking shots showing how disgusting the Manson family’s house was with the TV blaring creepy ass music did it for me. Tarantino is a master at creating tension and I would love to see his take on the horror genre.
211,ev1g6mw,Don't forget he murdered his wife though.
212,ev2duu6,"Well it's really impressive, because Tarantino and Pitt had to balance the fact that he's a menacing figure with a dark past with the fact that at heart, he's a good-hearted moral person."
213,euyuago,Everyone is talking about the flamethrower scene but when Brad Pitt is throwing that red headed lady’s head against that mantle I lost it.
214,euypuup,Got to the third act and was like huh this really wasn’t as Tarantino as I expected it to be. Then that scene happened and I was like “oh. Yep yeah there it is”. Loved it so much
215,euyqqa7,My crowd was going nuts
216,ev4b5cy,"Also while Rick is busy trying to play the most genuine cowboy he can in a fake set, Cliff is out at Spahn Ranch living a real life western, walking through “town” being eyed by locals. Cliff Booth is the cowboy Dalton is trying so hard to be."
217,ev1ucke,Also explains why their opening credits were switched around in the car.
218,euyqvla,Margot Robbie and Margaret Qualley both had feet scenes
219,euyrjtp,Lmao there had to be at least 5 difference scenes featuring prominent bare feet
220,euyqq6u,When I finally saw Margot Robbie’s feet I thought to myself “There they are!” and grinned to myself.
221,ev37fwd,"A lot of people (here anyway) seem to know a ton about Tarantino movies, and next to nothing about the movies/stories/people Tarantino is actually referencing/inspired by."
222,euyszw0,It was too fucking good and satisfying
223,ev1q6ud,What made this more tense for me is that the first person the Manson family killed was a stunt man and it was on Spahn ranch. I was on such fucking edge waiting for that shit to pop off but I’m glad he lived to give us that ending.
224,ev8izb0,"Nah - if there’s one thing Manson would love, it’s getting a surge attention because of some great performance an actor gave portraying him. Sure other media gives him that attention, but at least this film didn’t."
225,euyqdyi,Red Apple Cigarettes!
226,euyqitp,Fuck me. I am tired of trusting these threads.
227,euyuhnn,"It definitely wasn't as plot driven as some of his other scripts. Thematically, the Manson murders in many ways capped the end of an age of innocence and hope for the country and Hollywood and paralleled Rick's fading career (in the dying western genre) at the end of his personal era of superstardom and hope. The ending was asking what would happen if things it never ended and we could continue to live in a pre-tragedy fantasyworld.

Edit: In thinking about it, I wonder if the Manson family inhabiting and corrupting the Spahn Ranch, personifying its deterioration, is what prompted Tarantino to make Rick an actor in westerns. It's a perfect metaphor"
228,euyt8aj,The scene with him tripping acid trying to figure out what was going on was fantastic
229,euyt2ll,"Agreed, he was magnetic and every time they went back to him was a breath of fresh air"
230,euyyn1g,Yup! You almost feel gypped till you realize we’re all better off without another charismatic/insane Manson speech.
231,ev0s4th,It’s alright we’re gonna get more of him in season 2 of Mindhunter. Same actor and everything lol.
232,euz44av,"That was the biggest ""oh fuck"" moment I've seen in a long time. 

Up until that point the fact that I recognized those actors' names was bugging the shit put of me."
233,euzc445,"I agree but you can feel his influence on his ""sons and daughters."" We see him one time but he's always there."
234,euyvw1p,"I just got out of the cinema, I think I missed it. When did Manson appear ?"
235,euzczqs,"But only for the last 20 minutes, the first two hours will be about on office meeting taking place in one of the buildings"
236,euz6dfo,Thank you. This is exactly what I was thinking.
237,euzlw1l,Oh my gosh I hadn’t realized until now how sick I had grown of seeing Hobbs and Shaw trailers before every movie I’ve seen during  the last 3 months.
238,ev1eekd,This is what I absolutely love about Tarantino's movies. I always feel refreshed by their originality. I especially enjoyed this one.
239,euzemn6,A nomination if anything. He better win the Golden Globe for comedic performances because that Acid Fight scene was COMEDY
240,ev05cbt,Supporting?? Cliff Booth was definitely the main character of the film.
241,euz4hb4,YES HE HAS TO GET IT PLEASE
242,euzc3sx,Yup! Maya Hawke. She was in Stranger Things 3.
243,euzl33x,"That whole scene was phenomenal. ""I didn't even l know that was your car six horse Judy"""
244,ev8eh7a,"Puts a dark spin on the ""anybody kills anybody by accident, they go to jail. It's called manslaughter"" trailer line"
245,euzlpsr,[deleted]
246,euzeuif,Fly down the road In Hollywood hills
247,euz3qwa,"Yeah it the end was pretty insane when Rick was standing outside their gate and Sharon Tate’s voice sounds so calming and concerned for him, little did she know what happened in a different reality :("
248,euz5yea,you ever see burn after reading? Pitt is hysterical
249,ev626pk,The huge dent made me realize this has to be a dream. The cut to reality still had me in stitches
250,euz1a2c,Leo pulling out that flamethrower may be one of my favorite movie moments ever.
251,euzku3h,"""Are you real?"" followed by incessant laughing got me too"
252,ev4084z,"There were a lot of laughs in the theater, but that last act had every single person in attendance laughing hysterically. My wife laugh-snorted more times than I could count. What a good time."
253,euyr4su,"It’s amazing how talented she is. She can be seductive like in Wolf of Wallstreet, downright trashy in I, Tonya, and here she’s just a loveable giddy sweetheart"
254,euys4y7,"That was my favorite part too, kinda just filled your heart with warmth. RIP Sharon Tate."
255,euysez4,"She was so effective with just her expressions, Margot was brilliant."
256,ev0u91u,I loved how almost bashful he was when he was talking to Sebring afterwards about keeping it and it still working.
257,ev0yj8q,a screaming hippie bitch wielding a knife\*
258,euzeb4p,Honestly that and Rick blowing up on himself and then NAILING the lines and improvisations for his next scene were brilliant to me. Really awesome character moments
259,euz2rtm,"I especially liked that he juxtaposed it with Rick yelling at himself for being a drunk and not taking it seriously. Meanwhile, she’s quietly putting in the work."
260,euzbxtd,I absolutely marked out at the pro wrestling parallels. Not sure if that's a common theme in Hollywood casting as well but I thought of wrestling immediately.
261,ev3dyi0,Yeah I swore it’d cut to him mocking his role in FBI when he was watching it but nope. He was honestly watching it and followed through as best he could for Rick.
262,euyy83x,Can we do something about this heat?
263,euz5la7,"Holy shit, you just gave perfect voice to everything going through my mind right now. My brother asked what I thought and I said I need to a week to figure out if I liked it"
264,euzhke3,"The whole time I kept waiting for something to click for me, it felt like there was too many stories that didn’t feel like they were leading anywhere, about halfway through the second act was when the movie finally felt like it was going to pay off. However, I really dig old time hollywood and felt like tarantino really immersed you in the world but sacrificed narrative. Not that that is a bad thing, but not what I expected going in."
265,euzaqlb,My wife had no idea what was going on.  I had to explain the Manson family to her in the drive home.
266,euzf0vl,"Yeah it did it twice. It was intentional, not entirely sure why yet"
267,ev3f842,I think it was to imply that Timothy’s character was talking on end and annoying Leo
268,ev3vi2q,Man golden age Hollywood was fucking weird. Like we talk about modern Hollywood being fucked but you could apparently get away with a shit load back in the day because I mean who the fuck would find out
269,euz4jxy,"He’s a professional, cool-headed character, a foil to his rather quick-tempered friend.  Rather charming, too.  He’s quite strong, yet probably wouldn’t harm a fly. 

But he likely killed his wife.  

I fucking love it."
270,ev8f8rx,Chekhov's cigarette.
271,evjgcgn,I saw it with a mostly Mexican audience. Everybody busted up at that.
272,evdviz3,That one is going to get some mileage.
273,evocwia,"Mine was ""My Booze dont need no buddy."""
274,ewfzljt,"""Real as a donut"" was mine."
275,euyuinw,Whiskey Sours of all things!
276,ev0zqi7,I loved how the mirror made his reflection look right at us.
277,euz8s4i,"I think if he wins an award, it’s for that scene alone. At first it was funny then it immediately wasn’t."
278,ev0zv8v,"""You mean the redhead out front?""  
""Didn't I tell you I was fuckin' blind!? How do I know what hair color she's got?"""
279,ev1im2c,"All of that tension just so she could have her George TV time.  
""What happens if she gets mad?""  
""Well.. nothing..."""
280,ev6ni0z,Good for Spahn getting his brains fucked out every morning.
281,euzjg11,"It wasn't Dakota Fanning.

It was Dacoteau Fanning."
282,euzq9j9,[deleted]
283,ev62zzg,"Yeah, it was really nice. Like Cliff hung out with him because he was paying him, but he also really enjoyed his company"
284,ev5vk8x,"And ordering pizza.

The bro-est of bro nights in."
285,ev7wq9o,I loved their commentary while they watched that episode
286,ev84r0e,"They somewhat teased it with Cliff on the roof hearing in his head Rick's reason for him not getting the job. He looked like he was ready to question it and be resentful...    
but then we get the flashback to which Cliff laughs it off and says, ""fair enough""."
287,euzpq26,"> I think at this point he leans into it.

Honestly, too much this time. It's to the point where we are beyond a 4th wall breaking nod and wink, and his fetish is just shattering right through."
288,ev1kazv,"Same experience only with my roommate. Immediately asked me, “I liked it but was it just me or were there a lot of dirty feet in there?”"
289,euzm6ob,[deleted]
290,euz4o1e,I wonder if she preferred raccoon or rat
291,euz9z7w,The can *specifically* said it was good food for bad dogs. Must've been great with all those scenes of her licking her lips watch Brad Pitt open up the cans....
292,evbg9r2,"Based on a couple articles, it’s was a female, Sayuri, for the acting and a male, Cerberus, for stunts. And according to their Instagram, the owners have bred them and puppies are expect in August."
293,ev41djx,And have armpit hair
294,evb8ryz,well i think the dirty feet part was more or less just for just him
295,ev1891h,[deleted]
296,ev4j5gx,I think he meant the camera shot because leo was making a weird face through the window and it was kind of ridiculous looking  in a funny way
297,euzlzwj,Him looking back in admiration of himself made me cackle
298,ev3oxds,Yes!!! You nailed it. I just wrote above it was a clear homage to Natalie’s mysterious death and wide speculation that her husband did it.
299,euzgg1z,I thought the girl that picked up the gun on floor somehow got an incredibly lucky shot or ricochet that lead to him collapsing and I just wasn't ready to accept that's how he died
300,evrrn7p,the not verbatim line had me dying
301,evbllmt,I fucking loved that Tarantino took what a group of fucking attention-seeking pieces of shit did and showed them for what they would have been had they confronted someone besides a bunch of actors and a pregnant woman. Watching them get demolished was the perfect revenge-porn moment for a real-life horror.
302,ev4ng2k,"That she got a punch in, only to jump and freak out like a maniac when it barely worked and Krenwinkel got back up with her knife in her hand got me rolling."
303,eva34ak,"So good! 

Rick was actually a fantastic actor when you see how he could snap into his role, no stutter or anything. 

If he’d had a bit more confidence in himself he could’ve had a much better career"
304,evjkvy8,I noticed the slight stutters right away. It wasn’t too overt but just subtle enough to feel real and truly show the characters growing lack of confidence.
305,evnbwby,"I thought it was hilarious that Rick managed to scare the fuck out of Tex Watson. I mean, he was a little shaky when he was talking to Cliff, but he was absolutely in shambles when Rick was berating him. Not only that, when they get to the bottom of the hill they collectively geek out that they just saw Rick Dalton from Bounty Law."
306,euyszsb,He was _fascinated_ by that can opener.
307,euyuq1u,His reaction to the dog food plopping into the bowl was hilarious.
308,evdpb6n,"The best part of that was it wasn't shot from his perspective.  It's so cliche to do weird movie shit to show the character's perspective is fucked up, but it's much funnier watching Brad Pitt just trippin' out."
309,ev046q1,"I was really hoping he was gonna survive the whole thing. Even though he killed his wife he just seemed like such a good guy. I was thinking that Leo was gonna die at the end too when she was shooting blindly. Tarantino isn’t known to kill his protagonists, but he’s done it a couple times so I didn’t know what to expect."
310,euyrc2y,I loved the Cinema Dome lighting up
311,ev0m0u5,Julia Butters.  She’s also pretty good in an ABC sitcom called American Housewife.
312,ev1csm6,Rick fucking Dalton
313,ev7d62m,Oh yeah you were on a horsey!
314,eva786y,His hesitation before that line makes it so much funnier. He was so unfazed by the whole situation.
315,evdu7di,"“They said they were doing... devil shit, not verbatim but still” that shit had me rolling."
316,euzoryc,Yeah it definitely did not help reinforce reality.
317,euys8e4,Dominic DeCoco
318,ev49o55,"The whole movie is the set up, the final scene is the punchline."
319,euzez25,"The scene where Cliff beats the shit out of Bruce Lee. Fantastic punchline, but also great setup for the final sequence where he takes on the Manson Family."
320,euzbq4w,Couldn't help but think of Kill Bill V2 during that scene
321,ev422nv,Her speech in the car about killing the Hollywood ‘murderers’ was fantastic acting. I’m too young to understand the Manson vibe but she really made that vibe come to life
322,euz48ua,He even calls it that earlier doesn’t he? Chekhov’s flame thrower
323,euyt750,Everyone in my theater was dying and cheering at the same time lol
324,euzmnzi,[deleted]
325,euyud9a,"God damn they fucked that chick up so bad. She got her nose broken, bitten by a dog, thrown through glass, then barbecued"
326,euys2xd,"Yeah lol that got an audible gasp from my audience, people were loving it."
327,euys9t8,[deleted]
328,euyvrgz,I don't know how I didn't see it coming honestly. He did such a good job of convincing me this wasn't inglorious basterds through the whole movie I really thought it was gonna be dark. I was so happy he was able to surprise me with this.
329,ev02320,"Eh, QT obviously has a lot of love for Bruce, as anyone could tell from the Kill Bill movies, but Pacino pretty much explains the purpose of that scene to us right in the beginning. He's the heavy, put there to push Cliff as the sympathetic bad-ass protagonist. The notion that Lee was more a cocksure salesman than once-in-a-lifetime fighter isn't exactly new, so they played off the perspective a bit for the scene. They have them butt heads, both guys have a good moment proving their fighting ability, and then it ends in a draw. It all seemed in good fun to me, and I dont really see what the big fuss is all about."
330,evcg58p,"""Spanish, Spanish, Spanish"""
331,ev8bbnn,He was in one of the shows with Leo
332,ev8u0bp,"lol I turned to my friend and said ""that's Marilyn Manson"" when Charles Manson appeared on screen lol"
333,ev8rhxe,It was really wholesome
334,evqa2qp,"QT also made Sharon charming AF. The cute snoring, the dirty pretty feet, helping out a friendly hitchhiker, dancing along to music and always smiling. She was just adorable."
335,euyxjis,"It's a bit of a shame that there wasn't more potshots taken at Polanski in the film, his character is barely in it."
336,evs3aod,"Shoots his bitch of a wife with a harpoon, you know, a real dude you can have a beer with."
337,euzmcj0,"i credit the actor that played the wife

she did a bang-up job in just a few seconds of screen time"
338,ev7iljd,"one black dude in the movie, for one second while Rick was filming"
339,ev7iiq0,remember when he said he was on a chain gang
340,ev1xqsr,Thank you! ^I'm ^Rick ^FUCKING ^Dalton
341,euz3p6t,The opening with the Manson girls skipping around while singing and digging through the trash was a really unsettling image as well.
342,euzq9wc,That whole scene of Cliff inside the house gave me real Texas Chainsaw Massacre vibes.
343,ev0kyyc,"And the fact there could have easily been 10 jump scares in that scene alone.  But instead it just ends, making you feel even more creeped out without a jump cut to shock the audience."
344,ev2bxj9,Jesus christ that rat in the glue trap.
345,ev1gsin,ALLEGEDLY!
346,euz6y53,Lol the dings when he slammed her head against the telephone
347,euz8u38,I lost it when he beamed her in the face with the dog food can.
348,euysl79,"It started getting really into the 'historical drama' feel with the narrator showing up and everything, which I disliked until I realized it was lulling us into a false sense of history. I really didn't think the narrator fit the Tarantino style until it did a 180 straight into Tarantino style."
349,euyt45b,When he busted out the flame thrower I think the theater all collectively came.
350,ev7nbr7,">Cliff Booth is the cowboy Dalton is trying so hard to be.

Ooohhh shit"
351,evboohm,He’s also makes a motion as if he was tipping his hat when the ambulance was pulling away.
352,eve0nlh,this comment made me enjoy the movie more
353,evqaivj,"While also getting eyed by the locals, a dog runs by the deserted road similar to what a tumbleweed would do. Cliff also rattles his keys when he steps out of the car that reminded me of what a cowboy does when he puts his hand on his holster."
354,ev3szcg,"It totally could have some thematic meaning, but things like this have been done in the past (typically on movie posters) as a way to handle two actors that share top billing. 

We read from left to right, so if Brad Pitt is on the left of the screen (or poster) and so is his name, then Brad Pitt will be ""top billed"" by default, because you would see him *and* his name first. By showing both actors with the *opposite* actor's name superimposed on them simultaneously, it muddies who's supposed to be ""first"" -- so neither Dicaprio nor Pitt has top billing, they *both* do."
355,euz85r8,[deleted]
356,euyrvhp,"Had to be at least fifteen shots of dirty feet, but the one where she was watching her own movie and her feet were framed right next to her face, I could just tell Tarantino was rock hard filming that."
357,euyqq5i,">!""And who the fuck picked this picture of me?! I have a double chin!!<"
358,euzu89g,"Now that I think about it, you could probably also  draw parallels with younger generation (Sharon Tate especially) finding their place in Hollywood while the Rick Daltons feeling lost in it as the age of westerns come to a halt."
359,ev23bwv,"Believe me, whatever Manson had to say at this time was NOT interesting or true.  At best, he’d be ramblin’ about how he and his family are going to live in underground desert cities after the coming race wars wipe out most of the world’s population."
360,ew8gk9r,Just an FYI gyp/gypped is a racial slur you may want to avoid using in the future.
361,ev1y9br,Dewey Crowe can't be held down
362,euywey3,He was the guy who walked up to the house looking for someone.
363,ev238pi,"Yeah he's clearly one of the two leads, arguably the main character. But I wouldn't mind trickery to get him a supporting nom. I don't remember the last time he was nominated."
364,ev3lx3b,I'm pretty sure one of the actresses from Euphoria plays a Manson girl too. The one watching through the screen door.
365,ev1bdea,"It really was! I loved how we all knew that Kurt Russell's character didn't want him there, and then the next thing he does is start a fight with the lead of the show and throw him into the side of her car. Then when it comes back to Cliff on the roof saying, ""fair enough"" lmao."
366,euz67ck,"Completely agree! She was such a sweet, caring individual. It's horrifying what happened to her and I'm so thankful the film didn't show any of that."
367,ev43uay,"Yeah that was the thing. He flipped revenge films on their head - the thing that you’re getting revenge for didn’t happen in the movie. 

But as He’s entering their house to live happily ever after, you realize how sad it is because that didn’t happen. Those 3 were brutally murdered. Very bittersweet."
368,euz9h3s,love that she also played the opposite of Leo who was starting to become jaded and burnt out
369,ev0yjj7,“Yeah it still works. Thank god.”
370,ev1vz7y,wielding a gun and firing it into the air
371,ev3gdpd,"That’s the BEST scene by DiCaprio in the last few years, and he’s consistently good. There are so many layers and emotions he goes through, as both Rick Dalton and the character he’s playing. Absolutely flawless."
372,euz04lx,Well...it’s a flamethrower
373,ev3emiz,Same boat. At one point I just felt like it was seriously dragging. But it was still entertaining even when it was dragging? Like the story part I was meh on for a little bit but the nostalgia and the settings of the movie were incredible. And Pitt and Leo every now and then would do something hilarious. I felt like I absolutely loved 25% of it and just really dug the setting for the other 75%.
374,ev3px46,[deleted]
375,ev8kjy5,I preferred Checkov's pitbull. What a good dog.
376,evs0uz3,"So many Chekhov's gun examples in this movie. The dog being so well-trained to follow his commands. The acid cigarette. The flamethrower, which you can actually see in the shed when Pitt goes to get tools to fix the antenna."
377,eve2eyo,Having grown up in SoCal it’s not a bad piece of advice lol.
378,ew1ysad,"""Believe it or not, but I got a flamethrower in my tool shed"""
379,evhwttf,The fact he was putting egg whites in it to make it frothy was a nice touch. He's a bougie drunk.
380,ev3obr3,I've had too many nights where i got fucked up on homemade whiskey sours.
381,ev2g0v2,It stayed funny for me. I get it got pretty dark but the way he was looking in the mirror and talking to himself yet made it look like he was addressing someone else was just magical to me.
382,ev32ip2,But he still hit that.
383,ev3tk9r,Apparently Manson has his followers have sex with him.. I guess as some sort of repayment
384,evegh2r,I just don’t like to disappoint her
385,euzud7i,lmao - bravo
386,ev11edb,The end of the 60s I think
387,ev8dgtc,"I felt they had a mutual friendship before that, that he had been his stuntman for years before he became his 'gopher' and that him giving him that job was an extension of that friendship once it got harder for Cliff to get work after his wifes mysterious accident. Thats why the friendship came off so naturally."
388,evbp7ll,"Man looking back on it...that feels really intentionally set up, because that was also the only moment in the film where I had even the slightest inkling that there would be a rift between them."
389,evdbhz0,That flashback was so great. I loved the fight between Cliff and Bruce Lee. It looked like it was a single take right up until Cliff threw Bruce into the car door.
390,ewn7sjb,"I was so certain that, during that scene, the Polanski's would see cliff and cast him in a movie; setting off a chain of bitterness between Leo and Brad. Nope. Movie took the high road on that one."
391,ev3io7s,Why become a filmmaker if you’re not going to flaunt your fetishes to an audience
392,ev1k4bt,"I would love to hear what Robbie has to say about shooting the feet scenes. Imagine the director known for a foot fetish telling you, “Yeah after that line we need a shot where you put your bare feet directly into the lens”. I’d be shook"
393,euz71ql,[deleted]
394,ev07te3,Pretty sure my chick was doing the same when Brad Pitt took his shirt off on the roof.
395,evb92ah,And may or may not be 18
396,ewzlh74,"Actually, he does an interesting bit of dramatic staging with the feet that is integral to the story beyond any “author appeal.” 

Tate and Pussycat both put their feet up in the exact same manner while sitting. The theatre and car scenes come relatively close in the movie, so we’re supposed to draw a comparison between the innocent, joyful Tate and the seductive, sinister Pussycat. The two represent dual sides of late 60’s youth culture, and Pussycat is supposed to be double of Tate, much like how Booth is Dalton’s double."
397,ev1toib,I could totally watch another movie of that character.  Fucking brilliant job by Tarantino and Pitt to bring that guy to life.  I'm so curious about the wife thing.  They left it hanging if it was a drunken accident or if he couldn't put up with her anymore and just said to the hell with it.
398,ev9w4mn,"Wow just searched that, Christopher Walken was on the yacht too!?  Old Hollywood has some secrets"
399,evbnp72,I also like that they took the time to roast a few more Nazis.
400,evzobv0,">had they confronted someone besides a bunch of actors and a pregnant woman. 

Also pretty amusing set up that the one who gets nailed with the can (Mikey Madison) gives that monologue-rant in the car about ""killing the people who taught us how to kill,"" then, instead of encountering Rick - who isn't a ""heavy"" in real life but just an insecure actor - they find his stunt double who can ACTUALLY kill people. Showing us the whole Dalton/Booth saga then dropping the Manson killers into it paid off SO well with that ending."
401,eva6glx,Right!  The instant he messes up his line while filming his first Lancer scene you can literally watch the confidence drain out of him.
402,exce7j2,"That, and how he could smoke without coughing when he was acting."
403,euzmhtc,"Hey, settle down, I'm doin the best I can given the circumstances"
404,euz9774,***WHOA***
405,euz3r04,"I laughed the first time at his trailer! Tarintino doing only what he does best making a dog food can plop loud, gross and way too dramatic."
406,ev32gfr,"Like 3 moments in the film it felt like Cliff would die. 

1 When he went to the ranch and wanted to see George.

2 when the gun was pointed right at his head 

3 after he was stabbed and collapsed"
407,euzbnaw,"During the advanced screening of it in the Dome, this moment got a huge cheer from the audience."
408,euyt3z5,Bravo
409,euza83d,Gor-LAH-me
410,eviq2lf,"To be fair, I laughed my ass off"
411,ewkjgtt,One pool party away from starring in a Polanski film
412,euzqgox,I thought he meant the flamethrower in the early shots of Rick's various roles to him using it at the end on the last Manson girl
413,ev0rrkj,Hey. Nobody beats the shit out of Bruce Lee
414,ev48jh5,The girl who ran away with the car is actually Uma Thurman’s daughter.
415,euzdyr5,Yeah! When she plucks out her eye.
416,ev1jh3y,Oh my god
417,evb6t97,"And it’s originally from a movie in which he burns Nazis from a balcony, thus alluding to Inglourious Basterds and its historically-inaccurate / historical-revanchist twist ending. This thing was super well-crafted."
418,ev2ii2h,Good. Anyone who's read Helter Skelter or anything about the murders knows that Sadie Atkins deserved that shit. What she did to Sharon Tate is absolutely horrifying. Girls was absolutely insane. That whole scene was so goddamn satisfying to me.
419,euz95w9,Really should have seen it coming with the “Once Upon a Time” title that this was a fantasy...but good lord I sure didn’t. When the title rolled at the end it clicked and I felt so stupid. It was right there the whole time!
420,ev1sy59,"Seeing Lee spar with Tate in her flashbacks made him more likeable too, and I think it's worth considering the idea that Cliff's memory of the fight would make him look better than the reality. There's probably an element of wish-fulfilling fantasy to it. Like, there's no way he would have actually dented a car like that, right?"
421,ev2h7zl,"I feel like that scene was to display Cliff's fighting prowess more than anything, for the eventual pay off at the end. The dude went punch for punch with Bruce goddamn Lee, that bunch of (fucking) hippies didnt stand a chance, acid cig or no."
422,evrzr5y,My friend saw Bruce Lee and said “is that supposed to be Jet Li?”
423,euzql8y,"There were even ideal moments, like at the Playboy Party where he was the subject of gossip. Easily could've thrown an elbow, and it would've been pretty fair."
424,ev2cpj7,"Polanski is still active and has his defenders. Taking outright shots, especially in the context of his wife and child being murdered would have been in bad taste.

That said, I think the lines at the party about Tate, Polanski and Sebring kind of show what Tarantino thinks might happen if Tate had lived. She would have ultimately left Polanski once she saw the darkness within him, for Jay Sebring, who was always by her side."
425,ev3a0ps,Played by Rebecca Gayheart! I don’t know if it’s intentional that he used an actress that also accidentally killed someone
426,ev2t9yk,With the mural of the cowboy in the background
427,euz8ick,i love that everyone prolly hated the hippies at this point
428,ev1krvo,"Him still holding the can as they walked in, I just knew someone was gonna get hit with it. The anticipation was killing me."
429,euzg6mx,Looked like it hurt like a bitch and a half
430,euz3cyn,That 180 in itself is so Tarantino haha
431,ev74n4q,Tarantino has had narrators in 3 of his last 4 films...
432,euzv7p2,"Or the young method actress (even his acting technique was dying,) I forgot her characters name. They were all pushing him out. That's why that scene of her whispering to him was so amazing. He's still got it, just enough hope that maybe he can survive. Beautiful moment

Edit: ahem...actor not actress"
433,ev27cco,Manson's race war fantasy is really an unique spin on the idea. Most white supremacist envision white people winning the race war. Manson was banking on white people being nearly wiped out with the exception of him and his hiding followers.
434,ev0skpj,The scene that gave me the most genuine smile was how happy she was whenever people laughed or cheered during her scenes in that movie.
435,evapwic,I preferred Chekhov's flamethrower. As soon as I saw it in the shed (when Brad Pitt goes back to fix the antenna on the house) I knew it would have some use later!!
436,ew5hidf,"Having grown up in a Mexican household, that's going to have some life"
437,evb8o1m,She fucked his brains out
438,ev60459,They kept him drugged and Manson had his followers sleep with him to essentially keep him preoccupied while they took over his ranch.
439,evy6mlx,He actually gave her the nickname Squeaky (Spahn came up with all the Manson Family nicknames) because of the sound she would make when he pinched her upper thigh.
440,ev3tokb,Because people are listening to the radio throughout the movie? Damn
441,ev8jq1j,"Could be a mix of both, regardless it’s probably one of my favorite movie friendship"
442,ev1y5zd,"During an interview she defended it, saying she likes being barefoot.  But I'm taking that with a huge grain of salt given it is a promotional interview.

If I'm bring honest though, I feel the only reason people think it's uncomfortable is because feet aren't considered a mainstream thing to sexualize.  Margot was full naked in Wolf of Wall Street but not too many people were accusing Martin Scorcese of using her image for gratification.  But everybody knows Tarantino as the Foot Guy because it isn't a mainstream thing to find sexy.  If his go-to device was nudity instead of feet I don't think he would be known as any sort of Guy."
443,ev36xir,"Most actors are honestly game for anything. 

See Margot Robbie insisting on being naked in The Wolf of Wall Street even though she was supposed to be in a robe in the script or every actor in Cats 2019."
444,ev3pj7h,"I’m prepared to hear people I know IRL talk to me about this movie, saying it was boring or wishing it had more action. And honestly, just on his character alone, I fucking loved this movie. Him and DiCaprio together as well was fucking great."
445,ev8esu8,"i think it was implied that an unexpected wave rocked the boat while she was standing in front of his harpoon gun and it went off.  I noticed during this scene that when she stands to yell at him, the boat starts rocking more, it rocks once or twice and then just as we cut to black, we hear a larger wave slap the side of the boat."
446,ev9xryy,"Yeah, he was. The speculation is
Chris and Natalie were having an affair and Wagner killed her. 

They actually re-opened the case a few years ago because of new evidence. 

Everyone’s confident Wagner killed her, just no concrete proof."
447,evebjoy,I know the 10th film is supposed to be his last but I could go for a whole anthology of film's centered around Tarantino just rewriting history.
448,ev0uhdf,"I'm the Devil, and I'm here to do...Devil shit."
449,ev04nt7,It sounded so heavy too! It added to the weight when that fuckin’ hippie got nailed in the face with a can.
450,ev18mzi,and the line about how he was one pool party away from staring in the next polanski film.
451,ev0rytu,Don’t forget you also see it in the toolshed when Cliff goes to fix the antenna!
452,ev7zn5n,She has had a good month.
453,ev57t6m,"Sadie especially. I know that case well and any time people would reopen the question of 'should she be paroled?' in recent years (before her death) my answer was always fuckin' ***nope!***

It is extremely likely that it's true, the Manson girls were deprogrammed and rehabilitated after their long incarceration. They were once victims of Manson too. It is also true that I never, ever wanted Sadie or the others to get out. Her in particular I could never trust."
454,evb4ryc,It was a great attack on the mythos of the Manson cult. Busted that shit wide open. I hope Squeaky Fromme sees it.
455,ev7amoz,That kill was honestly probably more satisfying than Hitler in inglorious basterds
456,euze45m,"Yup! The ending just made sense once the title rolled in. 

Quentin Tarantino title sequences are always amazing."
457,ev2v7nc,"Yes, I thought it was going to end with the Tate murders. At the end when ‘Once Upon a Time’ came on the screen I was like duh....this is a fairy tale ending oh the true story."
458,ev9w2jh,Those fighting flashbacks with Tate reminded me of kill bill practicing scenes
459,ew08zvb,My girlfriend whispered into my ear and fucking said “omg it’s Jackie Chan!” And I completely lost it
460,ev09qji,I think that ludicrous Austin Powers-esque  doily blouse was embarrassing enough.
461,ev3qlhz,"I figured the line about ""he's gonna do something to fuck it up"" was a jab at his eventual rape charges"
462,ev406qg,Whoa
463,ev3piru,The mural was Giant. James Dean
464,ev7528b,Well they also murdered a 8.5-month pregnant actress and used her blood to leave a message to her husband and were extremely racist in real life so...
465,evrpl7x,"The whole time I was actually super scared thinking he was gonna get absolutely slaughtered, but then I saw him with the can and signaling to his fucking pit bull and knew he had things under control lol"
466,ev47gy2,And then coming out to rule over the senseless/stupid blacks (even though they just wiped out a population far greater than their own and one that had much more power).
467,ev6o5na,Exactly. Radios are constantly on.  Until then.
468,eviws4n,"Well, it's much more clear once you realize who's driving the boat:

>**Cliff:** Oh, man, I shot Billie in the face!  
>  
>**Jules:** What!? Why the fuck'd you do that?!  
>  
>**Cliff:** Well, I didn't mean to do, it was an accident.  
>  
>**Jules:** Oh man, I seen some crazy ass shit in my time, but this...  
>  
>**Cliff:** Chill out man, I told you it was an accident, you probably went over a wave or something.  
>  
>**Jules:** Hey, the boat ain't hit no motherfucking wave.  
>  
>**Cliff:** Hey look man, I didn't mean to shoot the bitch, the speargun went off I don't know why."
469,evecp67,"I think it implied that was a possibility, as much as it implied he was just fed up with her. I think he intentionally didn’t want us to know for sure"
470,evl7cwh,"That's how I took the scene, but I respect leaving it the way it was for interpretation.

He looked more tired/drunk than seething with anger. He had that kind of ""here we go again"" look and seemed to just be waiting out her rant, as opposed to a ""I can't take any more of this"" look, followed up by a homicide."
471,eva9ibo,I have heard it was Robert and Christopher that were having the affair...
472,evl5dhe,A super feel like he's not going to stop directing films.
473,ev2g7uk,“No. That wasn’t it. It was dumber than that.”
474,ev1kfyz,holy crap i forgot about that and then he pools out the flamethrower at the pool?!? wtf that’s awesome
475,ev3niuh,"When I saw that I was like ""Heh, nice callback"", not expecting the flamethrower to come back. I'm so happy it came back."
476,evbeoe9,"It's crazy that she was able to film all of season 3 of Stranger Things and her part in this movie in just a month, that's some real commitment I tell ya what"
477,ev8xspk,"I heard women cheering and applauding when she was getting torn up by the dog, there was this older woman in front of me she was so happy to see her get killed it was like cathartic to her. So glad they went with the fantasy of seeing those evil folks physically pay."
478,ev3pwr2,Leave it to Polanski to dress like a fucking *goober* to a party at the *fucking playboy mansion in 1969*
479,ev3o3fq,But that was actually historically accurate to what he wore.
480,ew9umt6,">On June 13, 2001, while driving a vehicle owned by Italian actor Marco Leonardi (her From Dusk Till Dawn 3 co-star), Gayheart struck nine-year-old Jorge Cruz, Jr. as he walked across a street in Los Angeles. Cruz died the following day from his injuries. Gayheart paid the family $10,000 for Cruz's funeral expenses and was given permission by the family to attend the service, but ultimately chose not to. On August 7, 2001, Gayheart made her only public statement on the incident, in which she said: ""The pain of this tragedy will live with me forever. Despite the allegations in the lawsuit, the facts will establish that this was a most unfortunate accident."" On November 27, 2001, Gayheart pleaded no contest to vehicular manslaughter. She was sentenced to three years of probation, a one-year suspension of her license, a $2,800 fine, and 750 hours of community service. The parents of the boy filed a wrongful death lawsuit, which was eventually settled out of court."
481,ev9nfxp,I love how Tarantino gives us history as we all wish things had turned out.
482,ev914o9,I like how the flame thrower was used on the Nazis and then the racist Charles Manson hippies.

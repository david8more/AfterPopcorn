1,dki91mg,Watching the timelines finally sync up was so immensely satisfying.
2,dkiav55,"Still can't believe that guy tried to shit on the beach 5 minutes in, got interrupted and then held it the whole movie. "
3,dkidtpl,"From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunkirk_evacuation):

4,dki82bc,Now waiting for sequel about Tom Hardy breaking out of Nazi prison wolfenstein-style.
5,dki71mt,"Pretty sad watching the French soldier go back to rescue his friend only to drown in the boat later from the same people he rescued from the sinking ship.

Edit: French, sorry. Typed it without thinking "
6,dkjfzi4,The scene with Cillian Murphy at night time may be my favorite scene in the movie. I forgot exactly what he said but his character was so calm and looked like a true leader when he was telling the boys there wasn't any room left on the boat and they'd be ok. The contrast with how shaken up he was when he was picked up by the family was incredible. It really showed what war could do to a person. 
7,dkiafcg,I like how the clock stopped ticking just as the fuel on the plane ran out. I don't know how I didn't pick up on that sooner 
8,dki8g1d,Torpedo scene was nuts 
9,dki8lx5,"Tom Hardy, unanimous MVP of The Battle of Dunkirk"
10,dkian2e,Can the Brits queue or can the Brits queue?
11,dki8rf7,"That was the least gory war movie I think I've ever seen, considering the action. I think the only time you really saw blood was from poor George, which is ironic because he wasn't even ""in"" the war. 

Great movie, IMAX was too incredible to explain, you have to see it to understand.  "
12,dkiapwt,"I'm surprised to have not already seen this here so I may be alone in this, but I felt that the most passionate and emotional scene in the movie was when Peter (the sailor's son) told Cillian Murphy's traumatized character that George would be okay despite knowing that he was dead. A beautiful display of compassion and grace."
13,dki9v7h,"**Potential Spoilers**

I never felt so claustrophobic watching a movie, the amount of screams from inside the sinking boat got to me. If I was to describe this movie in one word. It would be sad, just seeing the amount of attempts the men we're making trying to get off the beach, meanwhile others just stayed lining up because they knew it was no use. 

""The tide has turned.""

""How do you know""

""The bodies are coming back"""
14,dkigsct,Things I've learned today; every dude at Dunkirk was unfairly good looking. 
15,dki76y4,"Oh man, that scene where Tom Hardy's last buddy makes a water landing and having a sigh of relief that he's alive and waving at him, and Farrier waves back, only to find out later that his buddy was actually stuck and submerging. "
16,dki8083,The panic of that last private waking up to an empty beach was surreal.
17,dki8sbs,"Nolan's choice to keep the enemy concealed for essentially the entire film was genius. You knew that the French and British forces were being attacked by the advancing Germans but you never knew when or where they were going to attack. Kept me in a unique, gripping sort of suspense that I hadn't experienced in a movie before. Amazing. "
18,dkia1j4,"Nobody here has mentioned the most tense scene for me: The abandoned boat. The target practice, the accusations, the Dutch guy. All of that built into an incredible scene. The rest of the movie was spectacular but I thought that was the most suspenseful part."
19,dki8m5p,"That up-and-coming Tom Hardy has really made a name for himself in the film industry these past 5 years.

He's gone from 5 seconds of onscreen face time in ""The Dark Knight Rises"" to maybe a good 20 seconds here in ""Dunkirk.""

Excited for what's next."
20,dkiaqsn,That shot when the bombs were dropping closer and closer to Tommy on the beach was one of my favorite shots ever.
21,dkiaa0b,"Saw Weezer last Friday. Dunkirk was louder. 
"
22,dki6nec,"It's not a Nolan movie without Michael Caine. If you listen closely, you can hear his voice on the other end of Hardy's radio near the beginning of the movie."
23,dki6bsn,Did anyone else's jaw drop when they cut to Cillian Murphy giving orders on that one boat?
24,dki6s5u,"The scene of Tom Hardy flying silently was one of the best scenes of the movie. I got chills when the plane was shot down and it turned out it was him taking it down even when he had no fuel. For a movie so loud there were many scenes of silent heroism, which made them stand out. All in all, a brilliant, brutal and beautiful film. I saw it in 70mm which is worth the admission. "
25,dki7b00,"When Tom Hardy opened the cockpit and heard the cheering I almost shed a tear. Beautiful movie.


I especially loved the Air story thread."
26,dkixa8v,"Just remembering some of the really grim shit in this:

- The guy getting blown out of frame at the start

- The dude on a stretcher who clearly didn't get out of the sinking boat

- The oil being set alight and soldiers burning up as they resurfaced. Fucking hell."
27,dki627x,"The first bullet made me jump and it didn't let up from there. I loved how they placed so much emphasis on sound, it was loud at parts but unlike Interstellar I think it added to the overall feel of the film; war is loud and disorienting."
28,dkiacca,Every shot in the air was incredible
29,dkig8z9,"Mark Rylance's son telling Cillian Murphy that George would be ok killed me. 

I fully expected them to have a fist fight. 

But the idea that Mark Rylance's son didn't want Cillian Murphy to have that on his conscience on top of his other experiences brought tears to my eyes. 

Yeah. I can't remember the name of the character I'm talking about. "
30,dki6joc,"When the main character stopped reading the newspaper at the end of the movie, and everything went quiet, I thought I'd gone deaf. Wow, what an experience."
31,dki8nkm,Being on a boat watching your life and that of thousands of others in the hands of one pilot's skill. Fucking insane.
32,dki98k7,"I'm going to need a wallpaper of the shot when [Hardy had his back to the camera while his plane was on fire](#spoiler)

edit: forgot a word"
33,dki7coq,The silence when Tom Hardy's plane shut off and is just gliding through the air as the soldiers on the shore watch was amazing. Especially after the intense music and loud war noises.
34,dki7vej,"Although I have overall mixed feelings about this movie, I can confidently say that Dunkirk had the best dogfights I've ever seen."
35,dki6bbd,"Holy fucking shit was this movie intense. 

That ticking throughout the entire film though. 

Also, I'm actually really impressed with Harry Styles' acting. Thought he might be the weakest link coming into the movie but he played his role really well. 

Saw it in IMAX and god damn was it worth it. 

Only tiny complaint is it was kind of hard to understand/hear what anyone was saying. "
36,dki5zzl,Did German planes actually sound like that when they were diving? It sounded like shrieking demons from the deepest pits of hell
37,dki9qct,"Just came back from the 6pm show and man, where do I even begin?


I'll just say I can now fully understand why the Germans put the sirens into the Stuka bombers, because when they were on the bombing runs, I was in a constant state of ""fuck, fuck, fuck, FUCK."" That shit was terrifying.

I also loved how they had the perspective of an Allied ship in the Atlantic where all the U-boats were lurking. All you had was a ""TORPEDO"" warning and that's all enough reaction time you have before it hits.

The fact that the movie doesn't really give out any names at all, is great. It focused more on the evacuation itself and I can appreciate that."
38,dkkatad,"Collins: ""He's on Me"" 

Farrier: ""I'm on him"" 

Did anyone else just love the delivery of these lines?!
"
39,dki83sf,"Kenneth Branagh staying behind at the end was a really powerful moment. Really put things into perspective. The movie may have been coming to a close, but the war was not. There is still more bloodshed to come long after the credits roll..."
40,dkjz2ho,Was the soldier who randomly took off his gear and then just walked into the ocean committing suicide?
41,dki6ics,"If I could describe this movie with one word it would be:

Stress.


This movie has made me more nervous to watch than any horror movie I've seen within the last few years.  Just when you think the characters are safe you get thrown right back into war. I never really feel this way about any movie because most movies have an overwhelming amount of plot armor but  this one felt like no one was truly safe. "
42,dkiagr3,I'm convinced that Tom Hardy is required to wear a mask in all his films.
43,dkik5z8,"I loved this movie. One thing that stood out for me in this film was how realistic the dogfights were.

Here are a few details that I loved about the air sequences: 

- The aircraft didn't shoot 100% accurate laser rounds that cause planes to explode violently after one hit. Also they were firing in short bursts. Finally a dogfight in cinema where pilots are actually being cautious with their ammo consumption. Similarly monitoring things like fuel, manifold pressure and engine.

- The difficulty to get guns on target was so well portrayed. It took patience and skill to get those rounds to hit and it really showed in these dogfights. 

- The maneuverability of the aircraft was realistic. You could see them pulling G's and the planes weren't turning on a dime (even though they are Spits) or doing aileron rolls every 3 secs.

- The sounds of the aircraft in flight was phenomenal. I have been in a warbird myself and immediately recognized some sounds. Things like the prop stutter and the creaking and shaking metal. These are small details but don't go unnoticed and really add to the feeling of being right there in the cockpit with these guys.

Aside from these minor details that I loved so much, all of the air sequences were so beautifully shot. I have never seen anything like it.

Of course I loved every aspect of the film, but the air scenes took my breath away."
44,dki9isj,[deleted]
45,dkic63k,"I liked that when the second airplane went down, Tom Hardy saw that his squad mate got out and was waving, but when we actually got to see the scene he was still in his copkit and was trying to get out. What Hardy actually saw was his mate trying to get out. In the heat of battle he saw what he wanted to see, not what it actually happend.


The sound was fantastic in IMAX."
46,dkma469,"""I can be useful, sir.""

Dies."
47,dki65nd,"If you're even thinking about watching the movie, do it before it leaves theaters. The sound was FUCKING UNREAL in IMAX. Literally from the first minute to the last, the sound was on point and kept you into it especially with constant clock ticking in the intense scenes. Also didn't expect the three different timelines, but I liked it especially when you could see previous events from another perspective like when the bomber is seen making a run on the ship from the civilian boats perspective.

10/10 personally. 

Also RIP George. "
48,dki631t,"Music and sound design was the star of this one. Absolutely amazing. Did he start the loudness wars of film here??? Never heard my local theatre this loud before. Loved it. 

Even though I found myself thinking at times, the music was almost too intense for what was on screen. Felt like it needed something more epic going on. Then I felt like an asshole because what is more intense in real life than 2 humans flying in the air shooting at each other?"
49,dki62qc,"I thought it was brilliant. Rather then about war, it was about survival. It was brilliantly shot and just well edited. Probably Nolan's tightest movie yet.

I loved it despite the constant ringing in my ears "
50,dki6gn5,"That was a true war movie. In the sense that it felt like you were there, watching a war. No backstories, no plot, just you, the man next to you, and getting out alive. "
51,dkic3d5,"My heart is still pounding half an hour after the movie. Jesus Christ, that was intense.

It took me a bit of time to finally figure out the pacing of the movie, but I liked how it showed perspective from land, air, and sea. Harry Styles was also better than I expected.

But that fucking clock ticking was killing me. I was on the edge of my seat from stress for the entire duration of the film."
52,dkjubap,This movie was like a Hemingway novel about world war II in movie form.  Sparse but impactful and a pure experience.
53,dki8bsl,Finally a movie where the Germans win.
54,dki9e6j,"Me at the beginning of the film: ""one week? One hour? One day? What the fuck?""

Me after the movie: ""Only an idiot wouldn't have understood, clearly he was splitting the timelines""

Amazing movie. Styles is a fantastic actor, was not prepared for it. I gave myself a crick in my neck from tensing up the whole time, such an tension-wrought film in a fantastic way."
55,dki6l0k,"This has got to be easily the best movie for shaving a couple years off your life, just from the stress of it all."
56,dkirlo4,"This may be the best ""show don't tell"" movie I've ever seen. Tom Hardy had an entire character arc expressed with facial acting. The Navy commander had an arc. The british teenager had an arc. Soldiers don't talk, there's nothing to talk about. There is only waiting until they return home or die. 

The opening is terrifying and necessary. Why are they all on the beach instead of holding the mainland? Well, because they are ill equipped, outnumbered, and being wiped out by the dozens. The only chance any man has is to run, and hope to be the lucky survivor. 

There is a noticeable lack of reaction shots to the carnage, which was haunting. Men die by the dozens, they are put on stretchers, they line back up, and the grind continues. Every soldier is hoping against hope that it's not their turn, but every one seems convinced that their turn is coming next. 

And just like a good horror film, I learned new things to be afraid of. The idea that the hold of a ship is the LAST place you'd want to be, but that you HAVE to go below to fit enough men on board is absolutely terrifying. Lots of war films concern themselves with showing drownings, but this film shows you the type of man that knows the risks and drowns anyways. It was these soldiers' duty to each other to save as many lives as possible by violating every survival instinct they had. That scares me to the core. Also, floating deadstick in a plane above the enemy that will kill/capture you when you land is crazy to think about. 

This is the type of war movie I never thought I'd get to see. It's gritty, but not ""actiony"". It's grim, but still personable. It's smart, but not masturbatory or self-reverential. Loved every minute of Dunkirk, and I can't wait to see it again. "
57,dki5zg1,"I think this is gonna go down as one of Nolan's most mature movies. There's no bullshit, just tense action and beautiful visuals. It's not a quiet movie by any means but there's also very little dialogue.

I was intrigued by the structure of it. It basically follows three stories, one of soldiers on the beach trying to get off, one of air Force pilots keeping the skies clear, and the civilian ship coming to save as many as they can. Each story has its own arc and characters and struggles but all that takes background to the overall disaster that is the death. So whole there are stories and characters it does a great job of depicting just how miniscule they are to the big picture. I also loved the way time is handled. The ticking clock is ever present in the score but each story starts at a different point. The beach story is a week before the climax, civilian ship is a day before, and the pilot story is an hour before. So it's really well done how it skips between stories constantly but their times sync up for the ending.

I think the most powerful moments were seeing Cillian in the lifeboat giving orders before the war broke him, Tom Hardy saving the beach and giving himself up to the Germans at the end, and the kid on the civilian ship making the paper. I also loved how they had the kid read the Churchill speech at the end. While I didn't connect with the movie as emotionally as, say, Interstellar, I did end up loving it way more than Interstellar by the end. Although they are obviously different movies.

I'm interested to see how this does with general audiences and at the box office. Part of me says it's a little intense for the summer crowd. It's all last half of Titanic with the impressive disaster filmmaking and none of the cliche characters or romance. I'd say 8/10.
"
58,dki8me0,"Harry Styles was a stand out for me, I couldn't tell if I liked or disliked his character by the end of the film. "
59,dkiawh4,"So when Harry Styles character said, ""That old man wouldn't even look us in the eye"" he was projecting his guilt for what he did when inside the boat, right?  Because that old man was blind."
60,dkjbifz,"I see a lot of commentary on the lack of characterization, and normally, my enjoyment of a movie hinges on having at least a couple well-developed characters that I can care about. To my surprise, in Dunkirk, I really liked the complete lack of backstories, or even names in some cases. Especially for the three boys who start on the beach, it showed how war strips away your humanity and identity. It didn't matter what their names were, or where they came from, or who was waiting for them back home. The only thing that mattered was getting off that beach, and a remarkable amount of characterization came out of that. When each of the boys met each other, they instantly recognized a certain kinship that set them apart: they were all clever, they had their wits about them, and they were willing to do whatever it took (or almost) to survive. In the end, I didn't need to know anything more about them to care about them and whether they made it out. Well done, Nolan, and young actors whose names I don't remember (except Harry Styles because I don't yet live under a rock)."
61,dkjzr4q,Anyone else have a hard time understanding a lot of the dialog? Maybe it was my theater
62,dkjlglo,"2014: Come on, TARS!

2017: Come on, Farrier!"
63,dkjw9gi,"I probably didn't go far enough down to see someone mention it, but the scene where the ship is sinking and you can just hear all those guys screaming underwater is terrifying. It really shows you how horrific it must be when a ship is sinking like that. "
64,dkikffl,"So, Farrier becomes a PoW, gets locked up and is later rescued by Ra's Al Ghul and becomes Bane. Impressive follow-through "
65,dkiiv1q,"WARNING: YES THIS MOVIE IS NOTICEABLY LOUD

BUT you get used to it after 15 minutes and the loudness enhances tension and the flow of the movie incredibly

This is a movie is in a league on its own. Visual and sound storytelling is so crazy, I for the first time felt like I was actually part of that evacuation

Please spend extra on ticket or transportation cost and watch this in IMAX. Any other format will ruin your impression a lot because this movie holds on visuals and sound

Easiest 10/10 I have ever given"
66,dkiqco1,"Spoilers.....

I think my favorite thing was how it didn't use any bullshit military movie cliches. No redemption for Cillian Murphy. Tom Hardy didn't clear the Cliffs of Dover by 2 inches and land his out of fuel plane on friendly soil, nor did he die a heroic on screen death. The suspense around getting his gear down, doing his duty by burning the plane then becoming a POW with no other resolution was the exact opposite of a Michael Bay version. There was no corporal saluting Tom Cruise's court room bravery or Matt Damon saluting a tombstone or any other forced effort to show reverence and respect by having an actor snap to and fire off the stiffest salute they could muster. God I hate cliched salutes in military movies.

We see stoic bravery (as British bravery should be represented haha) yet we also see the cowardice and fear that is played out along an entire arc. Some movies will show an act of cowardice, or a soldier scared and overly dramatically calling for his momma, but then the movie gets right back to the heroing that need to be done. 

We start with Tommy doing whatever he can to get out of Dunkirk and then he spends the rest of the movie doing the same thing while...sorry, whilst his fellow soldiers calmly queue on the beach. Cillian Murphy looking back and seeing George's body being pulled off the boat and turning and disappearing in to the crowd was jarring to me. "
67,dki6gx8,"[""I'm staying...for the French.""](#spoiler) Teared up at that one.."
68,dkk3amw,"Just a small thing. The sound design in this was amazing. 

It being so loud and painful was a really great stylistic move. I think my 'favorite' part was hearing the Jericho Trumpets on the stuka. That whining sound has become the default 'diving plane' sound and every one knows it when they hear it. To the point that its not a scary sound at all.

The sound design in this movie really reclaimed that noise. You really felt deep dread at hearing it in this movie. It wasn't a default plane noise anymore, its was shrieking death."
69,dkjnj6m,"Just got out. I was very moved through out the entire film. The cinematography is superb. The sound effects and score are both A pluses. But I lost about 70% of the dialogue to the aggressive score and sound. I'm not sure what Nolan's goal was, but I wish the film had subtitles. It sounded like it was coming through a can. 

I was sort of over Zimmer after Batman and Superman. I felt for the past few years that his work was sounding the same. It's almost more like mood music than a traditional score. Boy was I wrong. The score for this film is exemplary. It was truly an extra character in the film. 

One thing I definitely caught that I wanted to applaud Nolan on was *you never really saw the enemy*. Towards the beginning, one of the ship's was being attacked, and I'm conditioned as a viewer to expect to see the enemy ship shooting it's cannons. But you don't get that, just like the real soldiers didn't get that. Even when the little ship is being shot up, you never see where it's coming from, and it makes it 10 times more terrifying. An incredible choice by the filmmakers. 

A few parts of the film brought tears to my eyes. Especially Hardy's moments. Great film, but hopefully the sound will be fixed for DVDs or I'll watch it in subtitles next time. "
70,dki6eu1,"Loved the film, it was truly mesmerising - I loved how at the beginning of the film, George tells Mr Dawson he yearns to get in the local paper if he assists in the evacuation and the link Nolan made at the end where he was named as a hero in the local paper "
71,dkpxzsv,The other pilot that wasn't Tom Hardy had really really nice hair 
72,dki68rj,"This really feels like a response to the backlash from Interstellar. Sparse dialogue, little exposition, based in history rather than sci-fi rules, only a few attempts at emotion. And it worked really well, while still taking advantage of Nolan's skill at playing with time and doing massive set pieces.

I especially liked Mark Rylance's story, it was pretty simple but I got invested quick."
73,dkiob03,We gotta talk about the elephant in the room. Harry Styles....actually a very good actor. I give him two thumbs up.
74,dkikmyb,"Superhero landing by Tom Hardy! 

That was an awesome movie.

You see towards the end where Styles says that the man wouldn't even look up to his face, but he* was infact blind.

So many little things make this movie extra special! "
75,dki6467,Did anyone else start to cry a bit when they showed the newspaper where the boy was declared a hero. I about lost it because I knew it was going to happen.  
76,dkpyz8k,"The French character saving them on the previous ship only to be accused of being a spy and then drowning trying to plug holes has to be one of the most tragic character I've seen this year, and he barely says a single word 

Edit: fixed"
77,dki6bo1,"Loved the movie, I feel so lucky that the closest 70mm IMAX was about 45 minutes away. Luckily I read another post earlier this week about how loud it was and brought ear plugs just in case but didn't end up needing them. The opening shot was worth the IMAX ticket alone as it felt like you were running right behind them. The water shots were so tight at times I felt as if I was drowning. Can't wait to watch this one again."
78,dki92ou,Anyone else get a t-shirt after watching it in IMAX?
79,dkldgkk,"When the boats arrived, I was overwhelmed with emotion. When The plane just glided above all the soldiers as they watched, oh man. What a film. "
80,dklk0it,Absolutely incredible what Tom Hardy can accomplish with his eyes alone.
81,dki6uj3,"I'm not British but as an American I have to say it was nice to see a movie about WW2 that had nothing to do with USA. Or even the Germans really. This movie was about regular British people(both troops and civilians) just trying to live and help each other.

I did not love the film but it is definitely an ""experience "" movie. IMAX is an absolute must. 

And I'm going to get blasted for this but I still stand by this movie being better at an R. When those planes came in it was a bit silly to see bodies flying with basically no damage at all. I'm not asking for saving private ryan. But there was barely any blood at all. Even for a PG-13 film. It took away a bit of fear everytime the planes came down. 

"
82,dkmaozq,"Is he going to be ok?


Yeah


:'("
83,dltwiqb,"This is a very important movie, because it doesn't glamorize or glorify war. Hollywood, especially in WWII movies, tends to show heroes winning glory on the field of battle. In this movie, our heroes were everyday people struggling to survive, and that struggle was hard to watch.

War is hell, and as we get closer to a world where there are no living WWII veterans, I am glad movies like this one are being made."
84,dki7wku,"If you're going to see this movie I HIGHLY recommend reading on the evacuation first and foremost. Again, it should not be understated how big of a miracle this truly was. If ANYTHING were just slightly different we'd be living in a truly different world. As a person who's almost obsessed with WWII, the words barely do justice on just how brilliant this film was. I shall be seeing this again tomorrow in another IMAX theater. Thank you so much Nolan for bringing the ""Miracle of Dunkirk"" to every ""Post-WWII"" generation. 

EDIT: Just saw it again at my local regular format IMAX. Still just as amazing. Honestly shed a tear in my eye when the bunch of small craft showed up to save the men trapped on the beaches of Dunkirk and Commander Bolton said ""Home"" when he saw the craft. This movie is just a true accomplishment and I honestly can't get enough of it "

90,dkiay9r,Dunkirk is why you go to the movies. Nolan has made his masterpiece that is both intense and harrowing. There are moments of joy and loss. I can't wait to see Nolan storm the Oscars after they unfairly snubbed him so often! 
91,dkjhstl,One thing I didn't understand is why that last guy in the plane who saved the day beached the plane so far away and in enemy lines. Why wouldn't he just land closer or pull his chute to get on one of the boats?

Great movie. "
95,dkjrybr,I will never complain about anything ever again.
96,dkid6u8,What was the significance of George's death? The way I saw it was the show the difference in the way people look at civilian death vs soldier death. We see hundreds of young men killed throughout the film but the death that hits the hardest is of the death of the civilian boy.  What are your guys thoughts? 
97,dkjdyx1,I might be beating a dead horse but that was the loudest movie I've ever watched. And so good.
98,dkl54qt,"I love how the film portrayed how war is sort of uncontrollable, visceral, and even clumsy. For instance, the scene when the soldiers are trying to climb out of the raft and one of them breaks their leg. Also, the sheer difficulty of lining up a shot on an enemy plane and missing most  of the time, or sinking a rowboat because the surf is too rough and too many men are trying to get in at once. I thought that the total absence of German troops added to this feeling - that war is not really something that takes place between individuals who are  in total control, but instead is a harshly imposed force that just sort of ""happens,"" and comes at you from all angles."
99,dklkyes,Tom Hardy's character: THAT'S ONE HELL OF A PILOT
100,dkoc544,"For me this film felt like a proper old war film. Like the Battle of Britain maybe. We don't have some soppy Germans, or moment discussing how awful war is. We can see that war is shit, we watch a man walk into the sea and drown himself. What we do have is a massive surge of patriotic feeling as the little boats arrive, ensign and union jacks fluttering in the wind. As Nimrod plays at the end. As the soldiers arrive back to a hero's welcome in idyllic England. I loved this film, and as a friend put it; ""this must be how Americans feel after every other war film."""
101,dki6ocw,Who else thought Harry Styles was about to become the villain in this movie...
102,dkkzpts,"Super nerdy fact here which I think sums up the films attention to detail.

In the scene where Mark Rylance character is sailing to Dunkirk and a two engined aircraft flies low over his boat, he says ""don't worry, it's one of ours"".

The aircraft that flew over was a Bristol Blenheim. This was an early war British light bomber, and there are only (I think) two surviving examples left in the world.

I love that they got in ones of these, just to fly over the boat and to generate about two line of dialogue. The plane is never seem again. It really serves no narrative purpose, but it has probably made plane spotters all over the world smile!!"
103,dklmccb,"Just got back from seeing it.  One of the most intense PG-13 films I've ever seen, and an absolutely amazing film.  They absolutely nailed the Stuka's sirens, not to mention all the other sound effects, too; if this film doesn't get at least nominated for an Oscar in sound design, it will be a shame.  The actors were all great, and it was refreshing to have most of them be relative unknowns.  

The best part was the cinematography though.  Everything from the sweeping shots of soldiers waiting for boats at the beach to the relative intimacy of a rescue ship's cabin was intricately detailed and full of life.  Massive, massive respect to Nolan for having actual planes do the dog fights instead of just phoning it in with CGI like too many directors would've done.  Bonus points for actually filming at Dunkirk, too.  

Nolan perfectly captured the dual despair and hope within the events at Dunkirk, and as a massive WW2 nerd, I hope this film gets the love and money it deserves.  

9.5/10, go see this movie in a theater like it deserves to be.    "
104,dkmagez,"I just saw this with my girlfriend and her parents. Her dad's Dad was actually involved in Dunkirk and was stranded on the beach.
When the film finished and the dedication for people whose lives were affected, he burst into tears and was sobbing.
The film moved him so much and gave him an idea of what his dad went through.
It was so powerful and moving and such a unique cinematic experience.
I continue to be astounded by Christopher Nolan"
105,dkp4hl0,"I didn't realize there were different timelines until Cillian Murphy was simultaneously in the boat with the civilians and the rowboat in back to back scenes. This, despite the fact that it had changed from day to night a few times."
106,dkrpkbv,"I love how the main character -not only didn't know his friend's backstory- but he didn''t even know he wasn't British and couldn't even speak English. That's war right there. The lack of personal stories and backstories was intentional, Jeremy."
107,dljqode,"Did anyone else hear the soldier get squished by the first ship at the beginning of the movie?

Harry Styles's character just barely got out, but another guy was stuck in the middle. You hear the guy start screaming and then hear the metal crush the body.


It was the most brutal part of the movie for me."
108,do7d6as,"Super late to the party, just got back from seeing Dunkirk. 

Overall I enjoyed it, but was somewhat disappointed. It's been so hyped-up that I had really high expectations going into it, and I feel like they weren't met. 

Visually/technically it was awesome, really great cinematography and special effects, anxiety-inducing editing (in a good way), really cool flying and dogfighting shots. I also actually liked the super loud gunshots and explosions, really made me feel like I was right there.

But the story didn't really grab me like I was hoping it would. At times it almost felt like I was just watching a montage of WWII footage or a documentary or something, rather than a ""movie."" It was a little too dry for me.

10/10 depiction of war, 7/10 movie."
109,dkingy3,"One issue I had with the film was that I never understood the scale of the evacuation. I feel like we only see a couple thousand soldiers, when there were around 400,000. Is this film just showing a fraction of the beach at Dunkirk?"
110,dki6htf,"I don't think I can even call this a film, but an experience.

That feeling of dread whenever the Nazi planes came into sight while the British were on the docks was terrifying. This has to be seen in a theater to get the true experience.

I also have to give props to Harry Styles because I thought he did great."
111,dklc870,"The most stressed out I've been in a theater in years, holy fuck. Loved it on 70mm too"
112,dkp7iro,The saddest part is that the young men that survived probably had to go back to war. 
113,dkwmptg,"[""Is the boy alright?""](#spoiler)

[""yeah""](#spoiler)

My mind was expecting a cathartic retort, like so many adrenaline-charged movies, and instead I was shown the better side of humanity. This movie is worth seeing for that subplot alone."
114,dkxwa1u,"I know everybody is complaining about the lack of character development, but that's what made the movie work. The whole point of the movie was the collective. About getting everyone off that beach to avoid disaster. 

Nolan instead gave us tiny snapshots of all the characters, then lets the viewer ""fill in the blank"" around it. For example, Rylance's character, who was a steady ""stiff upper lip"" type the whole time, only got emotional after wanting to rescue the downed pilot. We found out later that his son was also a pilot, killed earlier in the war.  It seemed like everyone had a tiny moment like this. A kernel that allows the viewer to build a backstory around that character and make them relatable.

What does this accomplish? This lets us marry the scale of the operation with the personal tragedies. When anyone dies on the screen, a small piece of the collective dies, because you get a sense that they all have a story, and they are all a tragedy in itself. Nobody gets the special treatment. In other movies, where the protagonists' characters are excessively built, you get a sense of detachment from all the other deaths and casualties, because you're so focused on the protagonist's story and survival. Everybody else is just a blank slate that dies, and you get numb to it."
115,dl5y3jz,"Something I didn't realize until a week after watching is how Nolan showed how awful war is by showing no gore or limbs flying off. Focusing on the fear, sound, and the situations of this event made war look just as bad (maybe even more) than saving private ryan."
116,dljjtvy,"I have no idea how people found this movie hard to follow.

I was expecting to be disappointed after reading some of the posts around here but I ended up loving it. Not the best movie nor my favourite Nolan movie, but it was great and unlike anything I've ever seen before."
117,dlmznpd,"For an hour 45 mins movie it sure felt longer than that. The unrelenting sense of dread they give you makes it feel like a marathon and makes them getting home that much sweeter. I was super impressed by all the visuals and the sound, especially during that torpedo scene... holy shit. Also they nailed the sound of the Stukas and their Jericho trumpets, which are designed to instill even more fear as they dive on you. They captured that perfectly. It was my first 70mm experience too so all the scenes with the Spitfires were gorgeous. All in all, my favorite movie of the year and a top 10 or so all time for me.

Only criticisms as others pointed out is the scale wasn't quite as it could have been. There were over 600 vessels involved in that evacuation but it didn't really seem like it in the movie, probably because it was hard to get more period correct boats. Also I feel they underrepresented the RAF's role in this. They made it seem like they were hardly involved for preparations of the next big battle, [but in reality they were](https://www.brentbaxterbooks.com/the-role-of-the-raf-in-operation-dynamo-the-miracle-of-dunkirk/). However, it seems like they were going off of the soldiers POV that they weren't doing enough to protect them which I guess is fair.

But all in all, great movie. Very immersive, exhausting, and hard to watch at times but it's absolutely worth seeing."
118,dkiai05,"As a male in their mid-twenties, I find it unfair how handsome Harry Styles is."
119,dki8cec,"* The civilian ships arriving at Dunkirk accompanied by the score was outstanding. [Up there with the end of Band of Brothers in terms of pure man-tear emotion.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9Ke2bMYBFs)

* Major props to Nolan for not showing the enemy at any point (I believe they’re blurred at the end when arresting Hardy) and making them a horrific looming presence. It made the fear of the soldiers that much more authentic.

* This film almost feels like a response to all of the criticisms Nolan’s received as a filmmaker. There’s very little dialogue, it’s a tight hour forty five, and the action is much more coherent than his previous works.

* On the other side of that though, while the sound design was good, the mixing is still horrific (picture the Damon explosion from Interstellar spread out over an entire film) and Branagh seems to have ended up as the expository dumper.

* All that aside, I think this is Nolan’s strongest film since The Dark Knight and I’m excited to see how it holds up on a rewatch.

* And my lord, how have we only had Rylance in the mainstream since Wolf Hall?"
120,dllio6q,"I think it's odd to read the most criticisms here, which all boil down to wanting it to be more like a conventional war movie (or just more conventional storytelling altogether).

I do think Nolan could have gone that route and made a perfectly good film about Dunkirk.  He could have shown more of the Germans.  He could have narrowed it down to a few protagonists.  He could have had the classic story of heroism and personal growth as the protagonists embark on a specific task/adventure. He could have gone with more dialogue and character moments (through hackneyed flashback sequences or whatever).

All of this would have probably been perfectly okay.  But he took a home run swing and went with something much more experimental, and I thought his reasoning for this was pretty clear by the end: this is NOT a classic ""hero's plot arc"" story.  It just doesn't fit that mold.  You could see in the conclusion that most of the fighters felt like cowards and failures.

If you went into this expecting a big, flashy moment of glory, this story just wasn't going to provide that.  Even Tom Hardy's climactic finish was getting captured and being forced to serve out the next FIVE YEARS in a P.O.W. camp.  That was the reality.  

To paraphrase Churchill, you don't win wars by retreating.  And, yet, there was a humble, understated glory in this moment.  This was a movie about duty above all else - just many small people doing the small things asked of them.  I guess that's ""boring"" to some, I don't know.

"
121,dki6x6y,"This wasn't my favorite Nolan film by far, but it was still amazing. I loved how it was shot, and how all the different perspectives came together"
122,dkidc90,"I had a ""holy shit"" moment when it was revealed that the drowning pilot was trying to get out of his cockpit and not actually signaling that he was okay to the other pilot "
123,dkicey9,nah he probably shit himself when the torpedo hit. or any of the other times he almost died.
124,dkioyzk,you think that was oil he was covered in?
125,dkj8vz1,"In the script he actually finishes shitting before helping the guy bury the body.    

*...Tommy looks around, clutching his stomach. He clambers over a dune, feverishly undoing his belt, dropping 
trousers and squatting before he realizes - He's not alone -*

*Another soldier, British army shirt undone, sweating with the labour of burying a body. This is Gibson.*

*The other man notices Tommy, but barely pauses.* **Tommy finishes,** *pulls up his trousers and moves towards him.*"
126,dkizatx,That story took place over the course of a week...he had time to drop that deuce when he was chilling under the pier.
127,dkjt9et,The entire movie was him trying to find a decent place to drop a deuce.
128,dkkpg76,Honestly I thought he did shit and they just took artistic liberty to not make it gross
129,dkii1cw,"If it weren't for men like him, the ratio would be a lot worse(and that's not counting who died)."
130,dkj3kev,"My head cannon is that the people who captured him are actually Allies in disguise. I really wanted him to go back :(. 

Also the guy who he is apparently based off, Al Deere, did also crash land and was rescued by Allied forces. Fun fact, he also scored the same number of air kills as Farrier (6) at Dunkirk (based on my count off wiki). He also supposedly had 18 throughout the war. "
131,dkla8va,"That dude was a total boss. The second he flips on the fuel reserve with no hesitation, he became my favorite character. "

134,dkiazxp,Tom Hardy in a Great Escape remake.
135,dkjpqrs,So why the fuck did Tom Hardy fly his plane all the way into enemy territory instead of just parachuting out near all his allies?
136,dkic8sr,Bane: Origin
137,dkjkhkf,"That shot of his hands reaching out from the dark water trying to clutch on to the ladder is one of the best shots in the movie, alongside that final shot of Tom Hardy in front of his burning spitfire."
138,dkln8q4,"I saw it as symbolism for the entire operation at Dunkirk. It was the French person who was helping save his British friend. He saved him multiple times, even opening up the sinking ships hatch so the British could escape. On the boat he was one of the last persons to hold back the water but he got trapped by the chains so he couldn't escape. Just like what the French army did for the British. "
139,dkjq39a,I didn't understand what happened there. Was he caught on something? It wasn't clear why he couldn't reach the ladder.
140,dkkxwlq,I'm so intrigued by this. Alex would have died if the two guys weren't trying to queue jump. Then he uses that as an excuse to kick someone out of the trawler. Then he tried to get Gibson to evacuate the trawler as well. Nolan always has such an interesting take on human morality in his movies. 
141,dkml3qu,That was upsetting because I wanted him to survive.
142,dkjzxc8,He's the only survivor from the ship that they find him on so every man that he was giving orders to on the rowboat was probably dead when he got picked up.
143,dkjs8zk,I didn't even know that was him at night. The jumping around between time lines threw me for a loop
144,dkiijaw,"It ""stopped"" 3 times, one for each of the parts"
145,dkichs2,"That poor Frenchman! He aided the protagonist almost every step of the way and like hundreds of other, he didn't make it out "
146,dkk91q1,"Torpedo was done beautifully. It was coming slowly, just with a slight bubbling, and they saw it coming for a good bit of time, knowing nothing could be done.

Every sinking boat scene was done so perfect. Lots of capsizing which was very common."

149,dkl1pfk,It wouldn't be a true Nolan movie without Tom Hardy crashing a plane while wearing a mask that makes it hard for a large part of the audience to understand him.
150,dkib75l,We shall queue on the beaches...
151,dkknd3y,In real life many people tried to skip the queues - and were held at gunpoint to return to their former position 
152,dkk65u9,"If you've ever seen a London Underground station being evacuated after a bomb alert, you'll know we've still got it. 

""We shall remain calm and move towards the exits. We shall not run, we shall not panic.""

"
153,dkkzdaw,That was exactly my thought when I saw them queuing.
154,dkjo0cx,I find drowning scenes a lot more haunting than a bit of blood. Not to mention drowning while being on fire.. 
155,dkjtdna,The screams from the people who were on fire when they were in the ocean is more chilling than any random blood moments they could've added for me. 
156,dkitjex,Which to me is ironic because this is the most 'war is hell' films I have ever seen. The tension and stress got me far more than the gore at beach landing in 'private ryan' ever did. 
157,dkia42o,"That's Nolan's style, you can see it when anyone gets shot in the Dark Knight films too."
158,dkie9pm,"Yes! So much this. And the nod of approval from the dad, you could almost hear the words ""you did the right thing"". So much was said with so little words in this movie. "
159,dkigjrl,I'm upset I had to go this far down to find it. That was pretty easily my favorite part of a boy making a more mature decision than most men would ever make. The kid could see that the soldier had been through enough and let him have a moment of peace. The movie was so incredible I can't stop thinking about it
160,dklg7s0,"My favorite part was actually when Peter's dad turns around on the boat and says ""I hear ya Peter...he could be alive..."" the emotion in his voice just showed how much he cared and wanted to help the soldiers. "
161,dkih40j,"Totally. The character was purposely childish, but at that moment, I felt as if the character progressed into a more mature individual. It definitely struck me, and one of my favorite parts of the film. "
162,dkiorki,I was waiting the whole time for them to throw Cillian Murphy off the boat.
163,dkk66p0,"I was nearly brought to tears when Cillian had asked literally right after the boy found out he was dead. I felt worse for ""shivering soldier"" than nearly anyone else"

174,dkidosn,Imagine getting left behind on *that beach.* fuckin ell
175,dkiea5f,Man that target practice scene where the soldiers were stuck in the boat waiting for the tide to come in was intense. I was so stressed.
176,dkij5ab,"exactly, I think there is only one 5 second blurred shot of Nazis when they capture Farris and that's it

Basically a war movie without showing an enemy and it is still one of the most stressful movies I have ever seen"
177,dkibgaa,"And in (almost?) all of the dialogue and inter-titles they were just ""the enemy"". Very ominous. Spooky even. "
178,dkidtc5,All the while cutting to the pilot trying to escape his sinking plane!
179,dkjd9mg,"The one thing that bothered me about this scene, is how they kept repeating that they need to get someone off the boat because it's too heavy, all the while there like a 800 pounds worth of water that is filling up the boat up to their knees. Like... are we blind ?"

189,dkib8qf,He's also thanked in the special thanks section of the credits.
190,dki6ei7,it was the point I knew for certain that the timelines were out of sink 
191,dkjoe97,Was he the one on the lifeboat refusing to let the land guys get on? Saying it would capsize?
192,dkiau2e,"Yeah! At first I thought, ""Why the hell did they cast a guy who looks an awful lot like Cillian Murphy, it's confusing as hell."" It didn't take long for me to realize that I am a complete buffoon..."

196,dkifab1,Loved the hell outta those dog fights. Grew up with a lot of admiration for pilots and the trust him and his partner had in taking down those enemies was so well done. Would watch a solo film of those two. 
197,dki8lss,"The last 30 mins with Hardy's character was immaculate. Especially the very end if you remember. I have my critiques of the film but his thread was executed to perfection. The shot of the plane against the city with the rutters not moving, soooo good."
198,dkixsof,"Man, I didn't even think of the poor guy on the stretcher. He had no clue where he was and the bloke just drowned through no fault of his own.

200,dkkq6p5,Another one that stuck with me was the sound of soldiers screaming and then silence as they were being crushed by the boat of wounded as it pushed against the bridge during the bombing during around the beginning. Also the two-second shot of a soldier trapped in a room as the waves just rush and fill the frame towards the climax.
201,dkkf48e,">The oil being set alight and soldiers burning up as they resurfaced. Fucking hell.

When the guy surfaced I was hoping he would be okay.

He surfaced into the fire and started screaming and I felt sick. Goddamn "

204,dki6rq4,"I saw it in 70mm.. the audio was REALLY loud - anyone else think it was louder than that of other movies? Maybe it was just my theater. Man when the boys were in that boat and bullet after bullet came through, I was squirming."

212,dki9cog,That shot was beautiful 
213,dki9er4,Probably the best shot in the film honestly. So well done.
214,dkic0ye,So did he shoot down the German plane at the end that the officer closed his eyes to accept his fate after seeing? And then ran out of fuel and coasted until he was captured by Germans?

216,dkifd2o,"Spoilers

Totally thought he was going down for good when he had that malfunction.  the look he had was acceptance it seemed. Like he did his best, and he could go down happy. Hopefully he made it through past credits "
217,dkkdg6p,"I've played a lot of WWII flight sims and I agree totally. When other movies have attempted WWII air combat they invariably run it at 2x speed.

218,dkmkgr6,"Yeah. Hesitant to even say it, but I didn't really like the movie overall. The ""intensity"" didn't work for me, and I didn't care about most of the characters... But the dogfighting scenes were great."

221,dki62f5,The Stuka sure did. It had a siren attached so when it hit a certain speed it sounded terrorising like that.
222,dki6mcu,"Stukas Were outfitted with a Siren under their Fuselage. so yeah they did sound like that, it was meant to demoralize Enemy Troops, Right before they dropped their Bombs."
223,dki7s9s,"Yes. 1000% yes. I know with films there's a bunch of ""creative leeway"", but Nolan made sure that this miracle was true to its original form. Unbelievable "
224,dki61qx,From the archival footage I've see it was pretty spot one 
225,dkimgei,"> I'll just say I can now fully understand why the Germans put the sirens into the Stuka bombers,

This - so much. I got genuine fear and anxiety in a god damn cinema seat 80ish years after the war. How the hell could you have handled it as a soldier - knowing that the death birds are coming and bringing high-explosive death? That siren was insanely scary."

231,dkkldte,"While Nolan deliberately fictionalized all the characters, [from the sound of it](http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2017/07/20/what_s_fact_and_what_s_fiction_in_dunkirk.html), the officer Kenneth Branagh's character was based didn't need any embellishment: 
  
>Kenneth Branagh’s character, Commander Bolton, seems to have been inspired by the real-life Captain William Tennant, who was on the scene and is credited with doing an astounding job of making the best he could out of the embarkation.

>Tennant later fought the Japanese off Singapore when HMS Repulse was sunk from beneath him. He survived to help organize the D-Day landings, even helping to lay an oil pipeline under the channel to fuel the invasion force. In other words, he made a pretty successful return to northern France after a hiatus of a few years. No word on whether he delivered dramatic one-liners as well as Kenneth Branagh.  "
232,dkjzk8o,"Either suicide or said screw it im swimming, which is pretty much suicide. "
233,dkk09oc,"There was a pretty good interview Chris Nolan did that I watched on Youtube. 

He was interviewing veterans at Dunkirk as research for the film and someone told him a story about how they witnessed a soldier strip off his gear and walk straight into the ocean. Whether it was to commit suicide out of fear or to try his luck swimming, the veteran wasn't sure.

Clearly that story stuck with Nolan because he added that scene in. "
234,dki7aq8,There were so many elderly people in the audience at our showing. I couldn't stop thinking about them every time my heart lurched from the gunshots or the stress.
235,dkic2g8,I feel like I paid $20 to let Christopher Nolan give me a 2 hour panic attack.
236,dkic1tt,I also think a crashed plane is also required too
237,dkkdz3r,I loved the creaks and rattles. Made it feel more like a brutal purpose built machine. Not some sexy sleek cool factor thing
238,dkio0xx,The aerial scenes stole the movie for me as well. Strapping a huge IMAX camera onto a working Spitfire was well worth the effort for Nolan and crew; every last frame looks like a goddamn Renaissance painting.
239,dkk92y2,"Hans is seriously hitting his peak with this and Interstellar. I like how the soundtrack really isn't music, but another story telling device."
240,dkmcdtw,[deleted]
241,dki67hy,I thought the sound was amazing but that the dialogue was not properly mixed. 
242,dki7c9l,"When the torpedo hits the ship in the night scene, the loudness was overwhelming and perfect.

Nolan tries to put you on that ship, and it works."
243,dkiarlw,"My favorite part is it doesn't romanticize war being creating out of this world heroes.  It was just a whole bunch of people trying to survive and making life or death decisions.  There was fear, cowardice, adrenaline, panic, joy, and every other emotion you can possibly imagine.  It was the most realistic movie I've ever seen, war or not.  

I think the entire movie sums that up when tom hardy's character gets caught; he was the one hero who put everyone else before himself.  A few people lied and cheated and hid and survived and made it home.  If that doesn't sum up war than I don't know what does.  In real war, the hero doesn't win.  "
244,dki86ju,Second this. It felt like we were trying to get through it with them. I went in expecting a gritty war drama. I've never been happier to be completely wrong.
245,dkkw7dh,I can't wait for the sequel. The British Empire Strikes Back.
246,dkidryn,"The entire time I was wondering, *how can the Mole (big boat?) take 7x longer than a tiny ship to cross the channel?* I thought it was saying how long each object took to travel, and the movie was so fucking unrelenting I didn't have time to consider my confusion about that for barely a moment."
247,dki6av3,"Yeah, Cillian's 'before & after' transformation was easily one of the best parts for me, especially since it happened so quickly.

"
248,dki8zbv,"Pretty clear that he was a dbag and his actions will haunt him for the rest of his life. Also, well acted, but it was tough to really judge the acting in the movie with so much action and so little dialogue. Not really a criticism per se but I just got home and I'm still trying to collect my thoughts on it. "
249,dkic9wd,"I think projecting his guilt over being evacuated... right? Like when the guy handing out the blankets said something he replied, ""all we did was survive"" and the man said something along the lines of ""that's enough"".

And also I felt like it was portrayed as shameful and a huge defeat *at first*, so naturally the soldiers coming home from that would feel unwarranted guilt. "
250,dkinv8j,"I thought it may have been alluding to the possibility he was a veteran of WW1 who was blinded by gas. The ""That's enough"" response seemed like it was coming from a place of understanding."
251,dkkc638,I'm English and I even struggled to understand some of the dialog especially the pilots. 
252,dkirxfg,"Well, there is a salute (the colonel to the commander), but I think it's probably the most weary, duty-bound salute you'll ever see in a movie. Two men showing respect for each other and each other's rank and duty. You're right, no cliche."
253,dkihykj,"As a French I was glad they let in the movie. French soldiers suffered heavy loss to protect the British on the beach, and nearly 40000 of them were fighting the fire of German forces. I would have loved to see more of their battle but I understand this wasn't the story Nolan wanted to tell."
254,dki91zt,Kenneth Branagh is the real MVP.
255,dki7vm7,"Mark Rylance was the biggest highlight of the film for me. It's really early but I'd love for him to get some nominations for this.

His character understands that this is war and sacrifices need to be made."
256,dkicj8l,"Maybe, but if you look it up, Nolan did the screenplay and everything 25 years ago. He did wait to make it so he could get more experience, so maybe he decided after Interstellar, he was ready. "
257,dkk7ngm,"I really enjoyed his performance. He had an entire film performance and it didn't bother me even the slightest - as oppose to Ed Sheeran's 3 minute scene in Game of Thrones.

Consider me a fan."
258,dki6wgd,"To me, it was when the son told the ""pilot"" that the guy would be alright after knowing he was dead. Really emotional. "
259,dki99gs,"Whaaat, I didnt :'( was it 70mm IMAX?"
260,dkldk4v,The score when the civilian boats arrived was incredible.
261,dkju48n,"I read somewhere that Nolan was super eager to make this movie because it wasn't something that was a typical Hollywood war movie. Instead of a battle, it was an evacuation, didn't have anything to do with the Americans and wasn't a huge victory, yet needed a large-scale budget in order for it to executed. "
262,dkjxrzw,I liked that. Any sense of stress or dread was based on the technical quality of the film and not because they made it really gory. 
263,dkjlchb,"On a propeller plane, when the engine is off such as a loss in fuel or engine failure, the plane essentially becomes a glider. You are taught in flight school to look for a spot that you can land and brake safely. You can do thinks like turn and basically spiral down to get the ground faster but your are trying to keep the momentum too so you can land. I also don't think he had a choice since he had issuses with his landing gear."
264,dkk9v1g,"I don't remember any of their names and yet I was completely invested in them. I felt sorry for that quiet French kid who drowned shortly after he was getting interrogated for being a spy. I wanted George to be okay. I admired Rylance's kid for not telling Cillian Murphy that George died. I sympathised with Cillian Murphy because he only did what he did out of fear and didn't mean to cause any harm. I felt sorry for Harry Styles thinking he was a failure. I liked the other pilot who crashed and ultimately helped Rylance save people. I liked Tom Hardy saving the day when needed and facing up to being captured. I respected Branagh's character for choosing to stay behind to help the French.

I didn't know any of their names and I didn't really need to. It's not relevant. George was the only one I remembered and that was because of Rylance's delivery of it from the trailer and the fact I read a spoiler here before the movie saying RIP George. But I still cared about what happened despite knowing it, because of that part where Rylance's kid says about being careful with his body. 

The ending with the boats coming to save the day showed it well to me how we're meant to care for the overall situation and resolve. How it was a failure but all those men made it home alive. I didn't need to know their names or see character development, I was too engrossed with their struggles during the event and whatever dialogue was used for them furthered my investment with them.

"
265,dkiw4po,"It's because of his decision not to use cgi. I applaud the idea but the scale wasn't conveyed at all. I heard a historian on the radio who was on the film shoot and said ""err, there should be smoke up to 8,000 feet in the sky..."" He said one thing they got right was that everyone was skinny. "
266,dkipyl0,"Yeah I agree. Often I felt like it was two unknown pilots saving two unknown soldiers.

Did not feel the scale of Dunkirk evacuation at all.

"
267,dkk0a43,"By the time the Spitfires show up there are not 400,000 people. They had already been evacuating for days and days at that point. The hospital ship that sank had already made six trips with evacuees at that point. By the time we have aerial shots from the plane there were not so many men left. However I would have loved to see a long line of tanks and jeeps and other abandoned equipment that had to be left behind. There was some shown here and there but that was a sense of scale that would have fit into the aerial scenes."
268,dkidrd7,"I guess I'm blind cause I didn't see that at all.

Also I only just now got that three different timelines were happening. "
269,dkj0dp0,I thought he was standing on the plane originally like shivering dude. I was really confused when they showed him trying to break the glass
270,dkj1i0c,He was also floating in the ocean for the entire night and chilling on the beach eating out of a can for several hours. 
271,dkjkcfn,So that's why he didn't catch on fire...
272,dkmsawi,"he was born in it, moulded by it."
273,dkjk2l1,Either way he didn't wipe.
274,dkwkvxj,I didn't understand why he couldn't just eject closer to the allied troops.
275,dkk2ga2,"it's nice to read that Al Deere survived the war and the plane crash on the beach, even though my mind tells me that Farrier's character died as a POW"
276,dklfyi3,"He hesitated. Not in that moment but earlier in the film, when he first noticed the other bomber. He looked at is gauge and knew his fuel was low. He needed to get out of Dunkirk and head back, but in the moment he wrestled between leaving, or staying, and know that he would for sure run out of fuel in the fight. 

I hope this made sense. I just remember him thinking about that earlier. By the time he needed the reserve, he was committed, thus, he switched it immediately."
277,dkinklp,You're a big guard
278,dkiq0cr,Stop! A man can only be so erect! 
279,dkjo5em,"Directed by Christopher Nolan.  Man, I'd be so down for that."
280,dklk15d,"The first first person shot during the dogfight where the camera was between the planes was masterful. It was just this flat, eerie shot and then the plane started firing. 

I also loved how the cockpit shots were really shaky, not in a shakycam kind of way, they just vibrated in and out of focus. Really captured how violent those planes must have felt "
281,dkoymvh,"Mind you, the British did evacuate about 100,000 French troops as well."
282,dkjug5t,There were chains in the boat that he presumably was caught on. I recall the noise.
283,dkk010q,"Exactly, just the phycological damage it did to him was so great. The contrast between him on the rowboat and when he gets picked up is incredible. "
284,dkl32mp,But I thought that boat pulled the two boys to shore?  I can't figure if they boat went down or another.
285,dkjsb4a,Once a saw him I knew it was the same person but it was confusing until you understand there all happening at different times. I think they way Nolan told the story added a lot more suspense then there would have been if he told it in order.
286,dkij2y2,wait really? even better
287,dkjy94g, it's kind of a nice stand in for what the French did for the brits there in real life. 
288,dkihn9g,Doon't you discount mah boy Froggy.
289,dkiz1mf,We shall queue on the piers...
290,dkizy3b,"We will duck for cover when the bombs hit, but get back up again and queue"
291,dkjnnjd,Typical French trying to push in on the pier as well
292,dkkvdrw,Yeah Tommy's whole arc was basically him try to skip a queue.
293,dkkzhw7,It's essentially a movie about queuing.  I'm not sure mainland Chinese audiences will understand the film.
294,dkkefev,"Seeing that guy holding his breath underwater afraid of the fire, and when he finally resurfaces he starts screaming. Scary stuff."
295,dkkre15,The scene where the torpedo hits was terrifying you could cut the panic in the room with a knife 
296,dkjwm1i,"Oh god, the guy who was holding in his breath underwater to not get burned killed me. "
297,dkk1i9d,"Well Saving Private Ryan had to do with firefights and small arms fire. This movie was mostly about navy and aircraft warfare so there was a different mood going in. You can't make Saving private Ryan without adding blood and gore to it, it wouldn't work."
298,dkipqut,"Yeah I feel like The Dark Knight did a great job at being dark, gritty and intense as fuck without resolving to gore, or even a lot of violence."
299,dkii90h,"Doesn't he figure it out at the end though? As they leave the ship Cillian Murphy looks back and sees a stretcher with a covered up body being brought off. He exchanges a glance with Peter and it looks like they both realize what happened, but then Cillian Murphy disappears into the crowd of soldiers.


There was no other dead man on the ship so what else could he have concluded. "
300,dkigkem,I was an awe at this point. Now we know what caused Scarecrows madness.  
301,dkm03sh,"Would you consider it a modern silent film? I feel like *Dunkirk* and *Lion* told enough through image alone, that the dialogue was not even needed to pull emotion from the viewer.

I'd consider both of them modern silent films, but I'd also like to know what others think.

Especially since a lot of *Lion* was in another language. And most of the dialogue in *Dunkirk* was minimal/useless."
302,dkii9rv,"Absolutely. I can't imagine I would have done the same thing had my friend been killed by a ""friendly"" man I just helped save. Gut wrenching. The head nod from the dad...so well done. "
303,dkq0ofs,Followed later by the Army claiming 3 hours when they climb into the blue ship
304,dklkan9,The way that was cut was so good. It could have been out of nowhere but the fact that we saw it coming and then they cut back to inside the boat was astounding. Dread is often more effective than surprise.
305,dkilbzo,"This is true, however in WW2 it was not. The British Army in WW2 was very much reflective of the general population. That happens when you have conscription, mass mobilization and millions of volunteers. "
306,dla53e7,"As someone who was in the British military, there are some ugly looking fuckers in it."
307,dkiif35,War does a lot of things. Fitness is definitely one of them. 
308,dkihwht,"*""OMG Dunkirk beach was the best. It was great to get that break from the Nazis.""*"
309,dkk0e48,He'd probably gotten 6 hours total sleep that week. Plus he did look like a pile of blankets
310,dkkz6og,They could have easily thought he was dead. 
311,dkjplsq,Turns out it was just Tom Cruise stuck in his loop.
312,dkj67p1,"That alone was stressful, but I was practically curled up in a ball when they were trying to plug the bullet holes with their hands."
313,dkiy1co,I jumped every time more shots rang through 
314,dkk3v8u,"If I remember correctly, you don't even see any of their faces fully."
315,dkk1m7w,"You really get the sense from the camera work and use of perspective that he's trying to help you relate with whatever character is being focused on at the moment. So in keeping with that, you see the enemy the same way they do - which is to say, not at all."
316,dkkyqt0,"The only time they said ""German"" was when they accused the Frenchman of being a spy."
317,dkipi5y,"I loved that Nolan intercut all those different scenes from different timelines together as if they were all happening at the same time, thus heightening the suspense."
318,dkjn0jb,"Deploy the garrison!

But for real, I'm with you here.  The water is already sinking it and if those guys stood the shot would be.. at their knees?  Their waist?  I can't remember but I think if they took all of them off without patching the holes they would just end up sinking right?"
319,dkkzklt,"If a boat sits higher in the water with less weight, it will take on less water from leaks. 

But I'm a sailor and you couldn't convince me to set sail on a boat accross any large body of water with that many giant holes in it no matter how many German soldiers are nearby. As soon as you get too far off shore and sink you just signed your own death warrent.    "
320,dkn4355,"I'm thinking it was to highlight that the war was fought by young, inexperienced men who had no real idea of what they were doing."
321,dkirjct,"Was the fact that he didn't take off his mask until the end a Bane reference? I mean, his friend (pilot in the water) took the mask off a couple of times, but Hardy did not do it until the end. I guess, in a way, it's also symbolism about heroes not always being known to the people they save. His ""face"" was his plane for most of the movie. "
322,dkj0iso,"I was amazed at how much he managed to get across with just his eyes though. I might have been reading into things too much, but all emotions were so easily seen with just his eyes."
323,dki7sks,Time for an extended cut!
324,dkjuupz,"Michael Caine is in Memento, but Guy Pierce forgot, so we never see it."
325,dklbq4d,"Most directors do. It's easier, and more than likely if they write the screenplay as well, they're writing a part with certain actors in mind that they know will do it and do it well. 

Nolan does this, Tarantino does this, J.J less so, but it's still there, etc."
326,dki6x5l,"Wasn't the only thing in the movie that was out of SINK!!

Am I right guys? Haha"
327,dkkfqif,"Didn't we know that they were out of sync from the beginning? It Said like day one, week one and hour one ...."
328,dkjwngg,yes
329,dki6pm4,"The stories happen over different amounts of time. It says at the beginning, the Mole is a week, the Sea is a day, the Air is an hour. We were seeing him in the Mole story, which happened before we see him in the Sea story. "
330,dkjr4px,"Was running out of fuel part of your plan?

Edit: WITH ONE SURVIVOR!"
331,dki6v0v,Really? That's incredible. 
332,dkim4pe,Do you know why he didnt just land his plane in the water so he could go back to england? Me and my mate didnt understand this
333,dkide32,"pretty sure that's not true


[Fact vs Fiction: Dunkirk](http://amp.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2017/07/20/what_s_fact_and_what_s_fiction_in_dunkirk.html) "
334,dkia3i4,Source?
335,dkiefut,It was executed to perfection up until the last shot of him landing. Could he not glide back around and land in the water? Did he not have a parachute? I'm confused why he chose to get captured..
336,dklendv,That guy / those guys getting crushed against the pier was.... Horrifying 
337,dkiajp9,"I had to ask myself ""was there ticking throughout this entire 2 hours until now?!"""
338,dki7dyv,"It was the delay I think.

They showed everyone inside a couple of seconds before it hit."
339,dki7irm,"Not only that, but the change of pace from the bustle inside the ship to suddenly being submerged and not seeing shit. That was terrifying."
340,dki74yc,It was definitely louder than usual. 
341,dki7suc,My theater was CRAZY LOUD never heard a louder movie either
342,dkkoni8,""" I'll be useful sir"" 

Ron Howard voice: ""he wasn't"""
343,dkjseuu,My gut says Peter.
344,dkii4og,"'We're going to War George!"""
345,dkie3pe,"Look up Winston Churchill ""in the fields"" speech. "
346,dkj9vg0,"'Then our empire beyond the seas, armed and guarded by the British fleet, would carry on the struggle. Until in God's good time, The New World, with all its power and might - steps forth to the rescue and the liberation of the old'"
347,dki9fj4,I saw it at an omnimax theater and I was just blown away with how beautiful that shot was
348,dkiokx9,My favorite was the shot of Hardy gliding his plane with the city in full view in the background
349,dkig861,"I'm partial to the shot of all the soldiers on the pier. One soldier turns around, then a couple more, then everyone, then they all hit the deck. "
350,dkicpev,Yes that was tom hardy's plane 
351,dkiyghl,Hr ran out of fuel first. Then shot the plane down and glided.
352,dkn193q,With you. Masterfully made on a technical level but there was a huge disconnect for me. I never really cared or felt for the characters so none of the scenes were really intense. I think it's a good movie but no part of the narrative clicked with me.
353,dkiy19r,[deleted]
354,dkj3a10,"It certainly did him wonders to have Nolan be the director of his first role. No discredit to Harry, however, as he really impressed. "
355,dkie18j,Yeah I think I'll enjoy the film more when I can get some subtitles. I couldn't make out the dialogue a good 50% of the time.
356,dki7p84,"Which was also the point of the Jericho Trumpets (Sirens), it was to terrorize the soldiers being bombed. Later on they were withdrawn, as soldiers became accustomed to it, and the sirens caused drag on the divebombers."
357,dkib6ka,"Apparently they didn't start painting the noses yellow until a few months after this battle, bit Nolan decided to tweak the facts a bit because it would be easier for audiences to identify the enemy planes."
358,dkocks1,"Same, I liked the display of bravado coming from an ace pilot just brushing off another near death experience "
359,dki7st5,What theater were you in? ? The exact same here 
360,dko0vzl,And chalking the fuel and time was just so fucking real. 
361,dkmgf6g,"The dude knocks the tea out of his hands, then knocks the life out of his brain."
362,dki6msp,"True, I couldn't understand about half the dialogue. 

The nature of the movie makes that less of a concern however. It's not about the talking, it's about the happenings. "
363,dki6dgr,"To be honest, I don't think Nolan was even concerned about the dialogue. The sound, action, directing and imagery made the movie for me. "
364,dkk209b,"this was my favorite part.  They resisted the urge to make it overly 'heroic'.  And IMO they showed WWII and war in general in one of the most accurate depiction.  
War isn't heroic like the movies, and definitely doesn't follow a linear story arc.  It's random, and brutal, and bleak.  It's a bunch of teenagers thrown into unbearable circumstances, and most are fucked up because of it.   
I really loved that movie"
365,dkk228d,"it felt like nolan just took a tiny slice out of a massive story, and trusted the audience was smart enough to figure out the context and significance.  Didn't even mention ""the germans"" once, they were just 'the enemy', because all the soldiers know who the enemy is by that point "
366,dkl3sfc,Followed by the Return of the Americans.
367,dkizj96,The Mole is not the boat. It's the pier they're all standing on. 
368,dki9zl1,[deleted]
369,dkidgxj,"He was a d-bag, but I could still see myself acting like him in that situation. "
370,dkibqi7,"This part really confused me. Are you saying his actions will haunt him, [because he betrayed the Frenchmen who saved him](#spoiler) or was it something else that I missed?"
371,dkiotck,"I remember one of the young soldiers sitting on the Rylance boat after they got clear of Dunkirk asking ""We let you all down, didn't we?"" That hit hard"
372,dkj0h7y,"Yeah, he thought the evacuation would be seen poorly. He didn't want to read the paper. He thought the guy at the train window was there to yell at them. "
373,dkjm6ca,"You have to remember that up to the two World Wars, going into battle was seen as a source of glory, not a horrifying consequence to destabilising global relations. That attitude still held over into WW1 which was why many men were punished for cowardice. Shell shock was also seen as a cowards diagnosis. Then WW2 saw total war across the whole continent of Europe and stretching into the Pacific theatre. Civilians were now getting a taste of what the men were getting and also more men than ever were subjected to the horrors of battle. An evacuation on the scale of Dunkirk would have been the ultimate act of shame and cowardice to those old attitudes. "
374,dkkatyc,"I liked the slight nod to it in the beginning. The soldiers who were guarding the rear of the beach were French. While everyone is trying to evacuate on the beach, who was defending them? The French  "
375,dks71g6,"As an American, it was such a breath of fresh air to see a WW2 piece that was from a European point of view. I know Band of Brothers, Saving Private Ryan, The Pacific, etc but I never felt the urgency the U.K. felt with how close the Germans were pressing towards their island until this film. I'd love to see something of this quality from the French point of view."
376,dkjn6ig,"> Mark Rylance was the biggest highlight of the film for me. It's really early but I'd love for him to get some nominations for this

Absolutely. Rylance's performance was so delicately woven - little quibbles of his voice, the tensing of a few facial muscles, and you knew exactly what he was feeling. It never felt put on or heavy-handed. 

He was playing a frightened man. And what do many frightened men do? They act as though they aren't. Thus, they are brave. What Rylance did was portray a brave man without glamorizing him or casing aside the element of fear. "
377,dkjkut5,"When he first said to his son about 'war changing people' or something and then looked out to sea, that glance told you so much. You could see that he was speaking from experience and that one line and it's perfect delivery felt like it added so much depth to his character. 


A great example of subtle acting and simple, efficient dialogue being much more effective than a long conversation explaining his backstory."
378,dki7lza,It's like he knew there was nothing he could do about it so why push it further.
379,dkjxgtp,"Or when the son said, ""be careful down there!"" And a soldier replied, ""he's dead, mate"", and the son replied, ""so.. be careful with him"". "
380,dkibyfi,"Fuck that was heartbreaking, Cillian Murphy's character looked genuinely relieved to hear that."
381,dkicdwk,His father's reaction was cool too. Seeing the maturity out of his son 
382,dkldlqk,I almost cried because apparently the boats used in the film were the actual boats used during the actual event. that sort of legacy now immortalized further with the film just made me feel something.
383,dkjdezm,"The bit right at the start-

The Mole - 1 week
The Sea - 1 Day
The Air - 1 hour

That was how long the 3 storylines took to converge on the same point. "
384,dkiyerz,"I missed it too. In retrospect, i wonder why it didn't click for me that there were three different timelines when the air timeline obviously couldn't have taken place over the course of the land timeline. Maybe it was because I was too absorbed in the scenes that it didn't really occur to me. Either that or i'm just not as sharp. "
385,dkio6kg,"There's your reason to watch it once again, so you can focus on those things you missed. That's what I am going to do!"
386,dkldszj,"What'd you think when Cillian Murphy showed up at night on the lifeboat, then?"
387,dkkzi5v,"I think we deserve a deleted scene, we need that poop payoff."
388,dkjqip1,[deleted]
389,dkwryrn,I took it as he was still keeping the sky's clear until his plane couldn't stay up in the air anymore. 
390,dkliruc,"Nah, German's treated British and American POWs pretty well.  Geneva convention, bro."
391,dkj2ey6,For you.
392,dkozuzj,"That's why the ending of the film was great. The entire movie the British soldiers were against taking the French, but in the end the admiral chose to wait to help the French evacuate. "
393,dklj2mn,"You're right, Cillian Murphy's character got on another boat days afterwards which sunk."
394,dklccqq,"The night boat shot of cillian is when it personally clicked for me that the timelines were separate for the first time. Not sure if that is when it is officially confirmed or if different viewers had other ""a-ha"" moments of their own while watching different scenes."
395,dkip6k1,"Yeah it stopped ticking just as Tommy fell asleep on the train, too"
396,dkmiext,"In reality, a little over one in three evacuees was French, more than 120k men."
397,dkwjk1s,"I mean, the British took well over 100,000 French soldiers to England with them so it's not like they just abandoned them. Plus I mean, they're there fighting to save France in the first place."
398,dkjdlsx,We shall queue on the landing grounds...
399,dksh42m,What I took from the movie was that bad things can and will happen to you if you try to skip the queue.
400,dkkztho,Not even the French would understand and they were there.
401,dklucnq,also resurfacing in the middle of the fire he probably wouldn't have been able to get a breath and go back down.  Fire would've burned all the oxygen immediately above it
402,dkkuezz,It looked to me like his skin started boiling underwater but i wasn't sure. also not sure how much an oil fire would increase the temperature of the water underneath. 
403,dkj9mo5,"Yes he does according to Nolan.  
*'..So the moment we came up with - ultimately, it became what is one of the most interesting moments of the film, which is where he asks if George is going to be okay and Tom Glynn-Carney playing Peter, says yeah. He lies to him. I don't think that was even in the script when Cillian signed up for it, so it was a leap of faith on his part. It was like, I'm looking for what's the moment that's in tune with everything that's going on in the film. It's in tune with the perspective of the film, so it's a tiny moment of heroism, I supposed you'd say.*

*Tiny, tiny, just sparing somebody's feelings. Then I put in the moment where he sees the body anyways.'*"
404,dkj5b36,"I don't know if in his mental state he would have put that together, it could have been someone who was too fargone and died below deck or whatnot.

I think the sudden disappearance kinda meant we weren't supposed to really know and it could have gone either way."
405,dkj55fg,He realized he was incepted and his father still hated him?
406,dkm0l4z,"In a dialogue sense, yes, it could have been completely silent.

In a sound/soundtrack sense, no way, the sound added so much. "
407,dklzjdo,"This was the British Expeditionary Force though, they weren't conscripts (or at least mostly weren't), they were professional soldiers sent over to support the Belgians and French right at the start of the war."
408,dkjnrcz,Lack of food in war also gets you very lean which is good for the face 
409,dkqeq1g,"On your feet maggot! 
"
410,dklpdfa,"Also, trying to force that one guy out while five metric tonnes of water flood into the boat."
411,dklmc9m,"They were panicking and not thinking clearly, I mean you're getting shot at and the boat is taking on water and all you want to do is get off that beach and if you miss the tide then you're fucked. In their minds all they were thinking was ""one of us has to get off and it's *not* going to be me"""
412,dklsfcq,"Sometimes when you are tired, angry, frustrated, lost, hopeless, and failing even after you've put in all the effort you could possibly give, all you want to do is blame *something* or *someone* for what's happening, no matter how petty it seems. I don't think it was much to do about making logical decisions rather than needing to vent. "
413,dkjkin6,And in Fury Road. Poor guy gets muzzled a lot.
414,dkjlplm,"As his buddy's plane goes down, even behind the mask and thick goggles the look of concern and then relief conveyed just through Hardy's eyes is remarkable.  "
415,dkionx5,Oh my god everything sinks in this movie. I have an irrational fear now of being trapped below deck in a drowning boat.
416,dkljuuw,"Call me dumb, but I thought that was how long it took them to get across the channel"
417,dki9k8l,Ohhhhhhhhhh. I thought the times were how long it took for those aspects to arrive at Dunkirk. Saying it now I realize how stupid it sounds. 
418,dki6ycx,Thanks for the clarification. So that was before his ship sunk. I see 
419,dkk5pmj,OF COS!
420,dki8up4,Ya. Tom Hardy is a crazy good pilot. Gets no respect 
421,dkin35d,water belly landing are much more dangerous than landing on a beach 
422,dkisgkw,"I wish they were a bit more specific on this point instead of sarcastically saying ""what do you think?"""
423,dkih3y4,"It's based off the real pilot, now as an WW2 aircraft fanatic I can say that based off the movie he could have theoretically landed both in the water and on the sand. However my guess is that the movie followed the actions of the pilot during Dunkirk true to its word but made up a couple of stuff for entertainment purposes.

For example, there was no way a Supermarine Spitfire (with the Merlin Engine) could maintain a glide for that long (and at that speed) and shoot down a diving aircraft without wasting too much speed and altitude. (Also remember the recoil from the guns slow down the aircraft as they fire)

In reality it all probably happened extremely quickly that the pilot didn't have time to land on the beach or in the water near their troops and instead had to find a better landing spot that was close enough to glide too.

Also parachutes back then weren't reliable and had a very high ceiling that was needed before jumping."
424,dkid68o,The ticking stopped exactly when that fella fell asleep on the train. 
425,dkibuap,It definitely was. The bulletholes through the side of the boat were jarring 
426,dklo95n,he fucking was you stop this slander
427,dkjf2y3,WE WILL FIGHT THEM ON THE BEACHES
428,dkihd63,The shot of probably the most powerful ship in the world retreating from Dunkirk while the civilian ship headed toward it was the one that got me
429,dkj3898,"Also, apparently Nolan didn't know of his existing fame through music, and hired based on audition performance."
430,dkise9m,Also they pretty much gave advanced warning for anti aircraft to prepare and open fire. 
431,dkk2rlk,"A film like this probably speaks to the older crowd, not a franchise, historical, etc. I saw this with my friends (we're about 19/20), and we were the youngest by a solid decade. It was 75% older couples, a few people there with their still fairly older children. Granted, it was a matinee though."
432,dklbkz0,"Don't forget the new one, the Soviets Awaken. "
433,dkjhskn,[deleted]
434,dkiazgo,The Beach scenes take place over the course of a week. The Sea scenes take place over the course of a day. The Air scenes are over 1 hour. It doesn't all match up until the end.
435,dkq0qdx,"Was it him that claimed survival isn't fair? Yeah, I'd probably start looking at things different than hypothetical ethics when I'm on a beach getting dive-bombed"
436,dkick42,"Not OP, but I think it's less of the betrayal and more of how he lost his humanity in that moment. He was so eager to survive that he didn't care if someone else died. A dick move, but a realistic one. 

(Although I do think he was slightly redeemed when he told the Frenchman to get out of the ship.)"
437,dklnikz,I think that was Harry Styles
438,dkkapp4,And the moment that scenes transitioned into cheering and giving drinks was beautiful. It was a well needed carthasis at that point 
439,dkkt9h7,"Your comment reminded me of this from A Game of Thrones ""Bran thought about it. 'Can a man still be brave if he's afraid?''That is the only time a man can be brave,' his father told him"""
440,dklmmgk,"Ive seen the film twice, and his desperation to save the crashed pilot makes so much sense with the context that his son who was a pilot died 3 weeks into the war. The guy didn't want someone else to experience that pain."
441,dkkarg0,"The moment when he told his son that someone might be alive on the plane. The emotion shown on him at that point. The sheer need for him to believe that someone must be alive then...

Absolutely fantastic "
442,dkk0elw,So Tom hardy ran out of fuel in an hour?
443,dkk4la7,I feel dumb that I had to have this explained to me lol
444,dkj65wo,"Takes guts, and common sense to accept that. That alone makes you smarter than most people."
445,dkldv21,I have a hard time recognizing faces so I didn't even notice. 
446,dkl4ovm,Amazing. Totally missed that while watching it
447,dknbajv,/r/moviedetails
448,dkllem7,"Soviet POWs, on the other hand..."
449,dkozzz9,"Indeed. The British did a lot to try and keep the French in the fight, even going so far to seriously propose that France join the British Empire, with her navy and colonies joining the fight against Germany. Even after that was rejected and Vichy France allied with the Germans the British still bankrolled and supported de Gaulle's Free French. "
450,dklsi59,"That boat did pull them to shore, he definitely didn't order it though. That was ""Gibson"" saving their asses again. Especially saving their asses because the next morning on The Mole you see all of these row boats  unable to get out and all of these bodies coming in. 

Talk about some attachment to a character that only said one word. ""Gibson"" was definitely my favorite character in the movie. "
451,dklx5ea,It clicked for me when the scenes on land alternated from night and day while the sea scenes were only day. Cillian confirmed it!
452,dkkvq7x,Oh I missed that. When did it stop for the boat?
453,dkwroxy,"In reality, over 35,000 French soldiers were captured because they held the line as the last of their compatriots were able to escape. 

If the French Hadn't stayed behind and held off the German forces, the whole scenario would have been a complete and utter disaster. "
454,dkjlx4y,we shall queue waiting to join the queue 
455,dkkfwaj,Aww man I thought he might've missed it. It was hard to tell that he definitely saw the body.
456,dkofykq,Nolan must really like Cillian Murphy and Tom Hardy.
457,dkmhd1d,The BEF being entirely professional soldiers was more of a WW1 thing. By the time Dunkirk rolled around the war had been raging for quite some time. So a lot of the BEF were raw volunteers. Not exactly conscripts but just as green.
458,dkn3pua,Why did they think that would do anything?
459,dklmg5r,"He's famous for being able to convey emotion by just using his eyes, something that not many actors can actually pull off (that's why you rarely ever see leading men wearing helmets or masks) and a lot of people probably wouldn't recognize him anyway.
"
460,dkkkxez,"Tom Hardy in my opinion is unparalleled in the physical side of acting. The way he stands. The way he moves his eyebrows, the intensity of his stare. It dictates his screen presence to the point where when he's on screen, viewers are captivated. If anyone was gonna put on a great performance with just eyes and a voice, it's Hardy. "
461,dkibbnd,I thought the same thing
462,dkigjtm,Don't feel bad. That's exactly what I thought those times were too.
463,dkj7512,">Christ, how fucking big is the English channel "
464,dkie3o1,He crashed with no survivals tho.
465,dkmfwnb,"I know right, the common theme of the article seemed to be ""You probably think this didn't happen BUT IT DID!""

So in the end I have no idea because it seems like something that didn't happen but the context of the article says otherwise..."
466,dkjvtg6,"The way Nolan portrayed time in the film (much like his other films) is that it was stretched differently across the different timelines whilst becoming a character itself.

The aerial action sequences, specifically shooting down the He-111, felt like quite a long time to Hardy's character, but when viewed from the men on the ship or the downed British pilot it was over in a matter of seconds.

So in that manner, Hardy's character managed a burst on the Stuka and it would've been over in a couple of seconds, but the way Nolan expressed the feeling of adrenalin turning seconds into minutes and minutes into hours it was portrayed longer than that. 
Really genius way of exemplifying how battle sequences always felt prolonged  to pilots, when it was only brief and fierce moments of action."
467,dkifkcs,"Not Mr. Styles, it was Mr. Whitehead."
468,dkqwtdu,"It's true, him being there and taking the hit from Shivering Soldier is the only thing that calmed him down enough to get him to stop trying to turn the boat around."
469,dklbuit,"Lucky for Nolan, he was then able to market his war movie to a hugely new demographic: teenage girls.
"
470,dklekut,He knew who he was because his daughter had talked about him but he didn't realize how famous Harry was 
471,dkl2edn,"I felt like this scene really made sense when you find out that he lost his other son 2(3?) weeks into the war. He knows what loss feels like and couldn't let another person's son die without trying to help. 

Edit: a letter"
472,dkk0zov,"He was already at half I believe when their scenes arrived. One problem they had during the real event is Spitfires were short distance attackers. So after crossing the channel, that gave them only about 45 minutes over the beach. However, like the movie, when crossing the channel they often got into engagements with German planes and bombers and never made it to the beach. Apparently the pilots in real life got treated like shit after because the soldiers never saw them over the beaches."
473,dkk7z8c,"Don’t be. Same with me. It doesn’t help that almost the entire movie takes place on one beach and over top one piece of water. It’s only night/day, the weather is the same otherwise. They tell you the timelines at like the 7 minute mark too. So there’s many reasons to not realize that they were 3 different time lengths."
474,dkl1rgn,It's was Pulp Fiction but set in WW2 and a little more sensible.
475,dklxzr8,"communist scums defies Geneva Convention, so Geneva Convention don't apply to them.

well, at least that's German stance and justification on it, I think it's still bullshit."
476,dks6fnz,"That's a point that a lot seem to miss in that scene. Gibson was in the boat, and after the camera cut to him is when the boys get a rope to hold on to get pulled into shore."
477,dkq03ve,"I think it only stopped twice, The Land and The Sea merged to Tommy's story"
478,dkjorhc,We shall never surrender
479,dkpv8ky,Even Michael Caine made an appearance as the voice of the RAF Commander. 
480,dkn3vbq,Panic I guess.
481,dks8ids,They were in their lowest moments and became very desperate. This scene was Nolan's way of showing what war does to a human. It tears their morality apart.
482,dkksjis,"I'm guessing you've already seen it but if you haven't, I highly recommend the movie Locke. Literally just Tom Hardy driving a car and talking on the phone, and every minute of it is captivating."
483,dkk1cyu,Was getting  caught by the Germans a part of his plan?
484,dkiflxu,Ah. Tbh I don't even know who Harry Styles is I just assumed he was the main kid in the beach storyline. This movie had that weird issue where everyone was a young dark haired male in the same uniform so sometimes I lost track of who was who in the beach storyline.
485,dklei39,"I'm not going to lie, Styles is half the reason this movie caught my eye. I like historical movies so I might have seen it anyway but when I heard Harry Styles was going to be in a Nolan movie about WW2 I watched the trailer out of curiosity and it looked really good so I saw it. 

Styles held his own too, surprisingly. "
486,dkmy2wn,[deleted]
487,dkk80ww,"My guess is that's what they wanted to show when the soldier snapped ""*and where were you?*"" at Farrier.

EDIT: Collins, not Farrier."
488,dkmkvh0,And there was a bit of that at the end when they reach England. One of the soldiers sees the pilot's uniform and makes a comment.
489,dkmc53s,"Yeah... when I saw the 1 week, 1 day and 1 hour I thought it meant how long it took to cross the channel. But then I was like I don't think there was a path to cross the channel that took a week not sure what they're trying to say."
490,dkk3sjo,The queue has been broken! requeue! requeue!
491,dkkj0uv,Of coursh!
492,dkig2eh,"I thought this too. I could tell Harry apart from everyone else because I'm used to his face, but just about everyone on the ground was some variation of ""middle-part dark-haired man"" or ""dark-haired men drenched in sweat"""
493,dkkbtfh,That was Collins he snapped at. Farrier was Tom Hardy.
494,dkl4ruk,"""They know where you were."" "
495,dknh4im,"I thought this as well, but when you see Cillian Murphy's character on the boat after the torpedo hits the vessel the young soldiers were on, it dawned on me that the timelines were out of order. It made watching the rest of the film even more enjoyable, waiting for them to come together. "
496,dkmpat6,"That kind of adds to it though, in my opinion. There isn't a single hero or group of heroes, they're all just similar people trying to get off the beach."
497,dkoejir,I figured it out the 2nd time you see the three spitfires fly over the boat in formation

0,gh327mp,"Of all the ridiculous plot points, the worst for me was the random Mayan shaman squatter. This guy had to be invented to be on screen for 30 seconds just to show us his ancient book. Two of the main characters work at the Smithsonian. Wouldn't it have made much more sense for them to just find this book in their archives somewhere?"
1,gh1s47n,Anyone else notice Cheetah’s arc was basically Electro’s from The Amazing Spider-Man 2?
2,gh1zitc,"Woman: I renounce my wish.

Kid: Mom, my cancer is back."
3,gh1kahb,At least one person would have wished for that guy to shut the fuck up so they could go back to whatever they were watching.
4,gh1vrsv,"Steve picks up a sword. To fight people with guns.

""Don't use that Steve. It's not their fault."""
5,gh2z3zn,After seeing the director split young diana's jump into the ocean into 4 cuts I knew I'm in for a shit show.
6,gh1q008,"Best line of the movie was ""Well shit Diana"""
7,gh2vyt2,"The term ""Ham fisted"" covers the whole movie for me. From showing Wiig's character as nerdy by having her drop papers and not be ""popular"" enough for her adult co-workers to help pick them up to the 20 or so catcalls in a row Gadot and Wiig both get every time they are in public, everything feels like it's trying to beat the viewer over the head. The entire film is a caricature dialed up to 11 just to make really sure the audience understands the already clear points it makes. That's not to mention the plot holes, inconsistent bad guy motive(does he love his son or is he too busy for him,) generally unrealistic ideas(WWI pilot knows how to fly a jet and thinks it's a good idea to fly through fireworks,) and overall unbelievability of the ending. You're telling me almost everyone on the planet got one wish and earth didn't immediately end from the chaos? And further, that thanks to a speech from Diana every single person also decides to rescind that wish when throughout history this artifact ended civilizations because not one person would? I get that it's supposed to be a fun suspension of belief but even so, what it asks of the audience is beyond that and as a result it ruins the feel. The first movie had a magic and weight to it that this one doesn't even begin to recapture"
8,gh1ppk9,Why did Trevor need to come back in another person's body? Was bringing him completely back to life that much of a stretch considering the Great Wall of Egypt just appeared out of thin air?
9,gh1jmf5,Was Max Lord’s kid just sitting in the office the entire duration of the plot? Was he being fed? Did he sleep on the floor and wear the same clothes?
10,gh3fkjm,"Me a few years ago: That was awesome, I wish they make a Wonder Woman sequel!

Monkey's paw: lol"
11,gh1j5va,I like how the movie escalated from a cup of coffee to World War 3
12,gh1pbaf,>!The armor lasted thousands (?) of years and its broken on her first rodeo.!< This is why we can't have nice things Diana!
13,gh1wtlw,"The most retro thing about this movie is Kristen Wiig’s “Oh look, the nerdy girl is taking off her glasses and now she’s hot!” transformation"
14,gh1n2b7,How come nuclear missiles can appear out of nowhere but Steve has to take an innocent man's life to appear?
15,gh1kh5t,How did one person on the entire planet not wish for the world to end?
16,gh1m1ot,So the planes on display outside the Smithsonian are kept fueled up enough to fly to Cairo and back?
17,gh21b6e,Did anyone else think it would have been much funnier if Max had turned into a stone when he made his wish?
18,gh1j7s5,The first 90 minutes could have been 30.
19,gh2v97k,What Smithsonian-level archeologist or gemologist is barehand grabbing a 4 thousand year old artifact?
20,gh2uuzj,"You have state of the art CGI and a virtually unlimited budget, and where does the final battle between Cheetah and Wonder Woman take place? In pitch blackness near some power lines and an electrical substation near a pond. 

I don’t understand why so many of these movies have their major action scenes in the most ill-defined and boring locations possible. The mall and White House scenes were brightly lit, clear, and reasonably well laid out. Why is our final battle so muddy and lame?"
21,gh1wluu,"The moment I knew this was going to go downhill was the very first scenes when it showed a very young Diana training with the Amazons— even though it was **established** to us **very strongly** in the first movie that Diana wasn’t allowed to train until she was caught as a teenager.

Bro did Patty forget the first movie?"
22,gh1k0lj,"Did anyone notice when all of a sudden, “oh yeah it’s Fourth of July” insert cool fireworks scene"
23,gh30pte,I'm halfway through this and I'm beginning to understand why Kirsten Wiig didn't promote this when she hosted SNL last week.
24,gh2unfw,All I'll say is after watching this movie I understand why Warner Bros had no qualms about releasing it straight to VOD / HBO Max.
25,gh97cwx,"WW1: I am a strong, independent woman that need no man.

WW84: I met this guy for 2 weeks 70 years ago, my life is an empty shell without him. I will sacrifice everything and everyone to be with him."
26,gh1iz4k,It seems odd to me that Diana never considered the moral ramifications of Steve taking over some dudes body.  Like not even for a second. And the guy he took over is apparently a cool guy and didn’t deserve to have his body stolen.
27,gh1jq3b,Who decided it was okay for this to be 2.5 hours?
28,gh1lmqt,"It’s weird going into this I thought they would over do the 80s but in the end it was barely noticed or brought up past one or two jokes. We didn’t even get any 80s bangers. This could have been set in 2019 and it would have been the same 

Stranger things gets to keep their 80s nostalgia use crown."
29,gh1puhq,"I can't get over how during the highway chase, the kids didn't give a fuck about a full envoy coming that were firing guns at each other.

Then when she grabs them but then loses control and rolls on the pavement with them, yeah those kids are dead. The dummies were super clear though.

Also Rome's civilization didn't collapse with Augustus Romulus, put some respect on my boy Constantinople name."
30,gh1lha2,Guess she forgot how to fly in BvS and Justice League
31,gh1n5ms,"""I wish they'd send all of you Irish back where you came from"" --Looks outside and sees guy in green shirt getting arrested."
32,gh1yymz,Pedro was really going for it. I will always respect an actor in a shitty movie who says ‘fuck it’ and just dials it all the way up.
33,gh2zwh1,"When she saved the kids she said ""This is our secret"".  WHAT'S THE SECRET?!  Please tell me.  Everyone saw it."
34,gh1uwlu,Suddenly she's swinging around like Spider-Man and flying like Superman...?
35,gh1iyyu,"Me: Hey. I just wanted you to know that you can't just say the word ""wish"" and expect anything to happen.
Maxwell Lord: I didn't say it. I renounced it."
36,gh1jj9n,So she got 7 billion people to undo their wishes?
37,gh1j245,The plotting of this movie was such haphazard nonsense that Diana could’ve pulled out a bottle of cheetah repellent in the third act and it would’ve tracked
38,gh3t28x,Am I taking crazy pills or did they barely use that killer Wonder Woman theme?!
39,gh1izjc,This movie went full Bruce Almighty for a second there
40,gh1jw7y,How can a movie this huge have such bad CGI?
41,gh1k25f,"Did it feel like the physics of the world never felt consistent? Between flying, continuing motion when she lassos someone, and how she electrocuted the cheetah girl while ALSO being in the same water as her. the whole movie felt like too much suspension of disbelief and more like a serious of odd choices.


Also at the beginning the leader of the Amazonian women's (not Robyn Wright) face was seriously impossible to read. Like she never looked interested or emotionally involved just like constipated and confused. So weird."
42,gh1mvjz,Whoever wished AIDS away had to renounce their wish.
43,gh30k9b,"So, did they forgot that Diana wasn’t allowed to train until she was a teenager? 

That was like a whole ass plot point in the first movie. 

And now the entire opening scene is about her training as a child....

Lazy fucks can’t even remember their first movie that they made"
44,gh1ldyd,"I loved the first one, but after this one, I have to wonder if part of their formula is to have an interesting reimagining of a villain for 3/4 of the movie, and then make them look as stupid as possible for the last fight"
45,gh1j9k8,"Anyone else thought the action felt... floaty? Even within their universe, the Man of Steel movies had weight and oomph to Superman's movements and punches. Whereas it looked like Diana was almost gliding along the ground/air with that strange forced slow-mo perspective"
46,gh1jorq,There’s something deeply wrong with the special effects in this film
47,gh1j0gp,"Casting Director: ""So you're going to play a man possessed by the spirit of Wonder Woman's long dead lover who she is still pining after.""

Kristoffer Polaha: ""Sweet. That means I'm going to have some sexy scenes with Gal Gadot.""

Casting Director: ""I didn't say that."""
48,gh2u96g,"""I wish I had an ice cream""

49,gh1j2by,"“I want to be an Apex predator”

I too want to be Randy Orton."
50,gh1izs7,Do you think the guy who wished for the coffee just spent the rest of the day locked in the bathroom suffering from explosive diarrhea?
51,gh1rfjs,I maintain my original instinct when it was originally announced — Chris Pine’s character should *not* have been ham fisted into the sequel.
52,gh1mf5z,"She lasso'd an RPG and an airplane?  C'mon, man!"
53,gh4b590,"Diana: ""I don't have a television.""

Diana, later on: Has hidden room full of televisions."
54,gh1jpp9,"Bold of them to start off the movie with 20 minutes of uncut footage from the Amazonian Olympics. Seriously, why was that sequence so long?"
55,gh1w2mh,">Villain: “I’m evil!”   
>  
>Diana: “Stop being evil?”

>Villain: “Okay, then.”

I really couldn’t get behind the story here, or the inclusion of Steve, or Wonder Woman’s third act monologue, or the second act, or the action choreography/editing...but the score and overall aesthetic were nice.

Very average overall."
56,gh1ufie,Not one moment of synth. Why even bother without having an 80s inspired soundtrack. Can you imagine the badass orchestral fight music with touches of retro?
57,gh1kfws,Did Diana spin in the jeep and change into Wonder Woman?  Diana is wearing a white blouse and they cut away to the tanks and back to the jeep and she jumps out wearing her WW armor.
58,gh60bll,"**Biggest missed opportunity:** Barbara & Diana should have *already* been friends at the start of the movie.

The most interesting thing about Cheetah is that she’s Diana’s friend. Diana should feel terrible about having to fight her. The film glosses over this personal conflict because Barbara’s just someone she met last week.

If they were already friends, we could have gotten a couple of scenes showcasing their camaraderie instead of hurriedly trying to establish a friendship from scratch. Instead of random pics of Diana on a farm ranch, they could have been pics of Barbara & Diana from the last few years.

It’s also a unique opportunity presented by the time jump. We would easily have bought that their friendship started sometime between the two films."
59,gh3hir5,"I feel like this movie is a perfect example of that old trope-saying ""You can ask an audience to believe the impossible, but not the improbable.""

Like, stone that can grant wishes? Sure. Wonder Woman's super strength and lasso of truth? Sure. Gods and goddesses and bringing people back from the dead? Sure.

But... sudden ability to turn things invisible? Sudden ability to fly? Swinging from lightning? Super armor that was supposedly indestructible, now being torn to pieces by Cheetah's random claw-swiping? Villain, who is just a regular human, walking through wind that is literally knocking WW down to the ground? WW unable to get the lasso anywhere near the guy but then somehow around his foot? _Everyone_ in the world renouncing their wishes? Not buying it."
60,gh1j054,As soon as she said she never found Asteria I thought 'That'd be a neat Lynda Carter cameo'
61,gh1khfu,Part of me wishes that Wonder Woman had sung “imagine” and that would have inspired everyone to renounce their wishes
62,gh1ka4g,"Steve goes from seeing fireworks for the first time to immediately thinking it’s a good idea to fly a jet though them

That fucking sucked"
63,gh58622,"Anyone else think it's hilarious that the last lines of the whole film are:

>GUY: It's just so wonderful. So many... things.  
WONDER WOMAN: Yeah.  
\[gazes at people laughing, a child lets go of a balloon\]  
WONDER WOMAN: So many things... so, so many... things..."
64,gh1j0bm,"It’s DC canon, confirmed by this movie, that Steve Trevor died and went to The Good Place"
65,gh1l4mh,"WW84 was very underwhelming.  The biggest need was a different editor. You could probably remove about 40 minutes from this movie and tighten up the plot a little bit, and it would’ve been a huge improvement.

Pedro Pascal seemed to be in a completely different movie than everyone else. He was really hamming it up almost to the level of Jack Nicholson in Batman.

Chris Pine and Gal Gadot continued their chemistry from WW, but Gal really seemed to be missing that *spark* which made everyone love her character."
66,gh2vg94,Um...does Patty Jenkins not understand the concept of continuity?
67,gh1juqr,Why were so many people working on the 4th of July? Did i miss something?
68,gh1j2e3,Is it just me or was a lot of the acting just....not good? The robbing scene in the mall felt almost like a parody scene haha
69,gh1qjax,"The ridiculous lasso with a mind of its own. Learning to fly out of nowhere even though we didn't see that in BvS or JL. Lassoing clouds and lightning. Invisible jet with magic tricks. Extremely wonky and dodgy CGI. The inconsistency in pacing and tone. Poorly edited action scenes that is incomprehensible at times. I had a bad feeling about this when they announced Chris Pine would be returning. He was too popular to use only once. It got weirder when they said it'd be an 80s movie. No swords or shields because it's too ""violent"" even though the Amazons are a warrior race and is all Diana wanted to be? Yeah, the signs were clear. The bare minimum a movie has to do is to establish what is possible and what isn't and stay consistent with those. The opposite of ""dark"" isn't throwing all logic out the gate and just winging it. What a bizarre movie this was. 

This entire movie felt silly and unnecessary. The 180 in its tone, direction and cinematography felt too deliberate.. Almost as if Patty and Geoff decided to join in on the internet circlejerk about the tone Snyder set for the DCEU. The first WW was a huge success by every metric - critics and audience ratings as well as its BO performance. It made Patty and Gal into Hollywood powerhouses overnight. Gal went from making $300k to $10 mil. Same with Patty. Why did they completely throw every element of the 1st movie away? We've barely seen Diana outside of her 1st solo movie so there was no necessity to reinvent or revitalize the franchise. Should've just stuck with what worked the first time and given the audience more of the same."
70,gh39qqw,"After spending the mid-part of the movie trying to discover “which god made the stone?”, I was hoping for something bigger than Maxwell Lord on a faux-Star Trek transporter being talked down from his wish-coke binge by Wonder Woman.

Can we reverse the endings of the first Wonder Woman and this one? 

Like, not have Nigel ThornbAres show up in the last part of the first movie and Diana just deals with the fact that evil lurks in the hearts of man and she commits herself to fighting against it because Steve and his troop proved there are good men with honest hearts too.

Then in this movie have the god of “treachery and mischief” who made the stone show up for the end fight? Hell, have the trickster god take the form of Steve... or maybe have the Trickster god be Steve all along because it’s too irresistible to not fuck with the daughter of Zeus using their wish stone? Have Maxwell Lord see that he was never “number one” and was always having his strings pulled so he renounces his wish and undoes everyone else’s wishes, creating a redeeming arch for him and fucking up the gods overall plans."
71,gh1vx36,This did not need to be the same length as Avengers Infinity War lol.
72,gh1jojr,"I absolutely hated the plane scene, the aircraft mechanic in me was just bewildered that a static display jet at a museum would work and gave fuel in it. Also there’s no learning curve from propellor WW1 plane to modern jet apparently."
73,gh1iyxy,Maxwell Lord should have wished for beskar armor.
74,gh1woq1,Well I’m officially worried about Rogue Squadron.
75,gh1jf42,Did that qualify as flying or was it more falling with style?
76,gh1wrck,If it’s a movie set in the 80s why would you only play like 1 80s song
77,gh6sl6h,"I know this movie has a ton of problems but one that just baffled me was when Barbara gave the food to her homeless friend she told him to stay warm.

We find out later the movie takes place around the 4th of July...."
78,gh3213f,"Well, silver lining, that cover of ""Imagine"" is now Gal Gadot's *second* most embarrassing thing she's released this year."
79,gh1y9sp,"Everything about this film felt really off. Bad pacing, poor fight scenes, terrible dialog and zero continuity or logic. 

* So many unnecessary scenes in this film that just seemed to be there to pad out time.

* What was the purpose of the first sequence with Diana as a kid? It didn't seem to have any real message other than to not cheat and to not take the short path but that message is never put in action later in the film... It's not like the gold armour she had couldn't be used if she wasn't ready. She just had the damn thing in her house for crying out loud. Definitely seems like it was a sequence that was made for the first film not this one.

* When she apprehends those thieves in the Mall she decides to completely total a Police Car for no reason...

* They completely glance over the ethical ramifications of her dead boyfriend possessing the body of some random dude... Some could argue she basically raped the dude... At the very least put some innocent dude in harm's way during the events of the film. I really can't see a single reason they couldn't just make him appear in his own body. It's not like the wish can't manifest physical objects which we saw with the Nukes. Maybe if it turned out at the end of the film that they would become a couple I could see some sort of link but they decide to shoot that down rather than just never bringing the dude back up again...

* So Diana can now just whenever she wants make anything invisible... Is this in the Comics?

* So Pascal just walks into the White House and conveniently they have a literal drawing of the device he needs to complete his evil plan... Talk about plot convenience...

* Pedro Pascal performance was decent but the character was really badly written. Never believed he gave a fuck about his kid who just seemed to pop up whenever it was convenient. 

* Another Hollywood, beautiful woman made ugly turns out to be beautiful trope! It's Ready Player One all over again...

* Pilot from WWI who only piloted propeller planes suddenly has complete understanding of how a jet made 40 years later works and handles...

* What exactly was the negative effect that Cheetah Woman had from her wish? I originally thought it was her turning into a Cheetah but that was done by Pascal when he did his broadcast. Was it just that she would turn evil/lose her self? 

* They hype up this amazing armour that the greatest Amazon wore yet it gets torn like paper minutes into the fight... Though I guess I shouldn't expect much from the same civilisation that use wooden bow and arrows against technologically advanced species that have flying space ship during the war against Darkside.

* Diana can suddenly fly by ACT 3 yet for absolutely no reason other than to make a cool shot and use it in the trailer she decided to lasso a lighting strike... Also why can she not fly in BvsS or Justice League?

* The flying scene decided to use one of the most cliche soundtracks you can put in a movie. Talk about lazy and unoriginal.

* That truck fight sequences was so poorly executed, some of the shots were the most obvious green screen last second shots shots I've seen in a film in years. Also the kids randomly playing on the road seems really odd. These kids are probably playing on that road all the time, they're fully aware to get out of the way when cars that you can see from miles away are inbound...

* Why didn't Diana just kill Pascal? They say it themselves they just need to destroy the stone or rescind their wish, I guess she was really banking on that whole ""humans are all good without Hades"" thing. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt that due to Pascal imbuing the stones power it might not work. Though if that was the case if he dies does it mean there's no way to stop the whole thing?

* They show that wishes can kill people so why didn't Pascal get someone to wish for that annoying woman with the Lasso who keeps trying kill him just conveniently dies? It's not like she's too powerful for the stone to work on her as we saw it take her powers away.

* The message at the end of the film has got to be one of the most ironic ones I have seen in a film. Humanity will do the right thing to save mankind! The pandemic proved that to be a complete disgraceful lie..."
80,gh1izfz,Maxwell Lord is very lucky he has Alistair. That little boy was the only thing in the movie preventing Wonder Woman from giving him his traditional [twist top head.](https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/7/74010/1360370-wonder_20woman_20v2_20219_2022.jpg)
81,gh5d864,I really wish that this movie had been about Wonder Woman.
82,gh8vqw7,"Me: Man. I wish they can release some of the movies that got put on hold due to Covid 

Monkeys Paw: WW84"
83,gh1jbpk,My dad yelled “this is bullshit” at the tv four times. I mean really yelled. Highlight of my Christmas.
84,gh3zws9,"In the arcade there was Operation Wolf.  that wasn't released till 1987, literally unwatchable."
85,gh5rcht,"My favorite plot hole of the millions of plot holes was when the woman at the restaurant wishes for the Irish to be deported. The guy responds and wishes she would die. She dies. Then later, he renounces his wish, so I assume she'll come back to life. But she was dead, so she has no idea what's been happening or why she should renounce. Thus, the Irish are permanently deported."
86,gh1j07i,It was a pretty good Spiderwoman movie.
87,gh1iz7y,[removed]
88,gh1izkl,That... was not very good
89,gh42bnz,Good idea by Gal Gadot and Kristen Wiig to make something so bad we all forget about their “Imagine” video
90,gh1j3iq,"There were some really solid elements in the cinematography, performances, and music. But dear god was that script in need of another draft or two. It’s a great example of how a movie lives or dies by its story structure."
91,gh1j9kw,"Did the entire creative team from the original get replaced by the folks behind the 2005 Fantastic 4 movie? Cos this was, like, the pinnacle of mediocrity. Two hours of nothing very remarkable. Hardly any action. Tons of contrivances. Terrible dialogue. What happened?"
92,gh1ni05,It seems unhealthy to be this obsessed with a person for 40 years.
93,gh1izbc,I recant my wish to want to see that movie
94,gh1vml1,"Pedro Pascal stole the movie for me. 

Everyone else seemed just there to be there because it’s a 200 million dollar movie.

Chris Pine had absolutely nothing to do in this movie. And same with the rest of the cast. 

Maxwell Lord as a character was fine.. but Pedro acted his ass off in his scenes and gave some heart, cheese and wit to a nobody villain.

The dude probably got paid the least out of the entire main cast but probably should’ve been paid at least the second most because he carried this shit movie on his back. 

Without his performance, I don’t know if I could find much else to say about it. It was just bland."
95,gh2u0pa,I knew it was gonna be rough when she was fighting 4 common criminals for 10 minutes having to recatch the same guys multiple times. She could of just knocked them out. Maybe she wanted to just be gentle she's different than batman? Then she throws them off the roof onto a police car ruining it and probably breaking all their bones...
96,gh35oyw,"Honestly, this felt like a major step back from the previous movie. The special effects look bad, the writing is abysmal, Diana herself felt like she had no real direction, it's riddled with inconsistencies and plot holes, and could have been about 45 minutes shorter. Frankly, I'm glad I didn't have the opportunity to see it in theaters, I would have walked away feeling like I'd wasted my time *and* money."
97,gh47cm4,"“Where is the dream stone?”

“Gone, reduced to atoms.”

“You used it two days ago!”

“I used the stone to become the stone.”"
98,gh1wioe,"I would have been upset if I paid to see this in theaters.

Just so... Broken and unrealistic.  

They randomly find a jet on the tarmac that had fuel and ready to fly.  

He suddenly knows how to fly a jet after his only experience is plane before 1920.

They fly through fireworks, which being dangerous, also somehow lasts a few minutes.  A real jet would have flown through it in 2 seconds.

And since when was it July 4th.  It's hot as hell in July in DC.  No one is dressed for summer in the movie.

What was the point of seeing that contest of hers as a child.  That you can't cheat?  

How did the son go from being in the office to being in the middle of the highway?

How did the helicopter at the end land somehow so close to where the son is?

Flying to Cairo takes like 14 hours or more.  A jet wouldn't have the capacity, even with fuel pods.  Plus, no bathroom?  And she said she would meet at the guy's place the next day?  The travel time would have made that impossible.

For someone so moral, she didn't feel bad for literally raping the body of the man Steve had taken over.  The guy had no say in this.

Missiles appeared out of nowhere. Cows and Porches appeared out of nowhere.  A wall appeared out of nowhere.  Why did Steve not appear out of nowhere too?  What was the point of him taking over another body?

In the White House, she has the bad guy lassoed while the secret service surrounds him.  She then needs to duck into another room.  Why not simply yank him towards her as she did all the guys during the mall robbery scene?  Instead she needs to go attack the secret service and come to him instead?

They find out the guy went to Cairo because they found his tickets in the garbage.  Why would they be in the garbage?  He would need them to board the plane.  If they were in the garbage, maybe he threw them out cause he wasn't going?  It seems a very thin reason to all of a sudden travel to Cairo.  

They stole a plane cause Steve doesn't have a passport. Steve doesn't have one but how do they know the body he stole doesn't have one?

The giving everyone wishes makes no sense.  Thousands if not millions of hippies would have wished for world peace. Yet the world was about to go to nuclear war.  How would it have dealt with that paradox?

Why would people renounce their wishes?  The guy just granted you a wish for a billion dollars.  You have no idea that there is anything negative going to happen.  Why would you renounce it along with the rest of the world 5 minutes later? 

It just seemed that they didn't care about real world stuff.  That's the problem I have with DC movies.  In Marvel movies, they understand that there is a real world out there and they work with it.  In DC movies, you are just expected to believe that no one can tell Clark is superman because he's wearing glasses and Batman, the greatest detective in the world, cares about the name Martha."
99,gh1j124,"Talk about underwhelming. 

Gal Gadot seemed bored as the once fun, inspiring Wonder Woman with jilted line delivery. 

What was Maxwell Lord’s motive anyway? At no point was there a clear, purposeful reason for him to cause such chaos. Then to have no repercussions after everything seemed odd. 

Weird that Kristen Wiig was the least disappointing part of the movie, I enjoyed her take on a role that seemed well outside her usual."
100,gh30ltj,"Due to the overall runtime and questionable decisions made throughout the course of the film, I am now convinced that whoever wrote it didn't have access to the Backspace Key."
101,gh2xyva,“Well shit Diana.”
102,gh3qg86,"As a person who didn't really like the original Wonder Woman to begin with, WW84 makes the first one look like Citizen Kane.  
  
I guess the worst thing in the movie would be the screenplay. The script is terrible and asks A LOT from the audience from a believability perspective.  
  
The close-second worst thing is the CGI. So many scenes were ruined from just really sloppy visual effects. One thing that most modern superhero movies do consistently right is combat scenes, but WW84 couldn't even pull that off properly.  
  
The score was good and so was the costume design, but aside from that, I can't think of a single good thing to say about the movie. Oh, the overall tone of the movie was just fine."
103,gh1ksvc,"Can't remember the last time I saw action/fight scene physics so laughably bad in a $60M budget movie, let alone a $200M movie. CGI mostly bad. Story was a convoluted mess.  


I was pleasantly surprised how natural Gal Gadot's performance was, though. She did a fine job, but the movie she was in sucked."
104,gh3daed,WHERE ARE ALL THE SHOULDER PADS??! And you call yourself an 80s movie
105,gh422sx,"Maybe instead of a 15-20 min Amazon games opener with awful CGI that served no real purpose to the story, how about a five minute scene showing us how Maxwell Lord came to find this stone that grants wishes?"
106,gh4on5c,This movie had an authentic 1980s feel...in the sense that everyone working on it must have been inhaling kegs of cocaine.

109,gh1j4nj,Tough when a movie tries this hard to be campy and fun and yet manages to be this boring. For what it’s worth Gal and Chris maintained their great chemistry
110,gh1jnbi,"The mall sequence was so tonally bizarre compared to the first movie and even the rest of this one. So cheesy and jokey. It's like it was taken from a completely different movie. The movie itself was fine, but not particularly groundbreaking."
111,gh1m0nk,"Can we *please* talk about how they straight up used Addagio in D Minor from the movie Sunshine?? It's even officially credited! Even when Hanz Zimmer apparently scored this, they used a score from **a different film.** I have never seen this happen in a large budget studio production. Unreal. 

(Also I doubt Zimmer touched this movie, as a scorer this screams interns' assignment)"
112,gh2w1ts,I don’t know if quarantine has made me a “running time grump” but I just don’t understand why a movie about a guy who turns himself into a “wishing rock” needs to be two & a half hours long
113,gh57z2s,I owe Iron Man 3 an apology now.
114,gh1lom7,"I audibly sighed at least 5x. I can't believe how boring this was, never in a million years wouldve expected that after the first one. The wish power made no sense or was poorly explained. The climax is just Diana sitting in a corner.... Why was it 2.5 hours?! Was the opening scene recycled from the first one? Nothing made much sense."
115,gh1iyho,"i was obsessed with the Diana/Steve relationship after seeing the first WW movie, so i was glad to see the chemistry was still there between Gadot and Pine in this one ... but at times it felt like someone was given millions of dollars to put a ""what would Diana do if Steve Trevor came back to life???"" fanfic from AO3 on film.

my favourite moment between the two of them was their brief conversation about flight, and how Diana loves that Steve understands flight so well (when she can't), in the invisible jet. i wish there had been more moments like that, and fewer of ... the other moments. reversing the fish out of water dynamic between them was fun at first but it got old pretty quickly since every other scene seemed to involve Chris Pine reacting to everything like this: 👁👄👁

edit: i went and reread Patty Jenkins' AMA from 2017 on /r/movies and she replied to someone with [a list of works that influenced the first *Wonder Woman* movie](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/6gc5mp/i_am_patty_jenkins_director_of_monster_and_wonder/dip48g4/), i feel like quite a few of these were also homaged in this movie too. the homage to the *Raiders of the Lost Ark* convoy chase was a particularly noticeable one."
116,gh1kcsj,Did the executives see the film and think “Hmm... Maybe this should just go straight to streaming.”?
117,gh1j0gr,This has to be one of the most boring and uninspired movies I've watched in a long time.
118,gh9pos9,"For a guy who loves his son, Max Lord sure spends the whole movie wishing it wasn't his weekend to see his kid..."
119,gh34ivw,The Mayan guy was one of the worst parts. I kept thinking to myself is this supposed to be some ancient Mayan text? How did they have printing?
120,gh3iibf,And the guy possessing a Mayan book which they could read and in the **middle of the book** it was described how the Mayan civilization fell apart.
121,gh4kc6y,"For that matter, why even have the initial mall robbery scene?

“Hey Diana, check out this artifact that was recently dug up and sent down to us.”"
122,gh3cw6d,You could also argue Electro took Selina Kyle’s arc from Batman Returns.
123,gh8wuhv,Pedro Pascal was like the evil Bruce Almighty.
124,gh270e9,Exactly my thoughts. Mistreated dork who looks up to hero turned villain with no real reason to be a villian.
125,gh2cc2n,I mean the alternate is for her kid to die in an awful nuclear holocaust
126,gh1poga,And millions would have wished for no nukes. Whose wishes get priority?
127,gh1rtdd,Somebody would’ve said “suck my dick!” As a joke and then a very interesting scene and dilemma would’ve taken place
128,gh1t1vh,"I was thinking about this. For sure with billions of people listening/watching, at least one person would have said ""I wish you would shut the fuck up forever and die."" Someone with anger issues would for sure."
129,gh29a6a,"The amount of times she gave zero fucks about her now miraculously alive boyfriend being put in mortal danger was amazing.

Yeah Steve fight the armored vehicle by yourself, Ya Steve jump in front of my bullet proof body with a serving tray, Ya Steve charge into that crazy woman who just kicked my ass while I sit here on the floor."
130,gh5t3gh,"I was alarmed by some of that first sequence, but reserved judgment. The robber sequence was unwatchable though"
131,ghgmahp,[Never Forget](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/474qxs/in_taken_3_director_olivier_megaton_makes_15/)
132,gh2btqx,I swear Chris Pine improvised like 50% of his lines.
133,gh26r70,Also season 4 of r/TheCrown in a nutshell
134,gh9m8r6,"Remember kids, if you see a man on the street at night, he's likely a creep that's either going to hit on you or assault you. At least that was my takeaway from how ridiculous the cat calling became. Every man was instantly just a huge piece of shit after dark."
135,gh1t847,"Yea, other wishes had no problem manifesting things into existence instantly. Dont see how a body would be an issue"
136,gh21ieh,"Not only that, but it had ZERO impact on the plot. No moral dilemma, no consequences. Just ""You're back but in a different body? Haha ok."" It was absolutely pointless."
137,gh2itx3,"Well we didn't hear Diana's wish. Maybe she thought, ""I wish Steve was back, but in a different guy's body. I wish for something to be done about that micro penis situation."""
138,gh1pyn1,I liked how he ran away from the door of angry people (or whatever they were) trying to break in through the entrance and then the next scene he is just walking around outside.
139,gh1ur4h,I liked at the end when the office (in DC) starts getting raided and trashed so the kid runs outside and he's suddenly at the landmark mall parking lot (in VA) then his dad Max and him are suddenly reunited in a field (in DC again). Only cooler part was lasso'ing a cloud and flying then instantly having that pimp ass gold wing armor.
140,gh1yyy6,ALISTARRR lmfao I died at that last scene where he popped up out of nowhere from bushes
141,gh5dzhl,"Top shelf comment, right here."
142,gh1kkf1,Cup of coffee guy was the best part of the movie.
143,gh23yjz,"I was still completely baffled by Maxwell Lord's entire motivation and ultimate goal. Also, what happened to the Dream Stone? They mention this Mayan god, but never bring it up again. Was this god manipulating Maxwell? Was he making him sick? What the hell was going on?! It was so confusing."
144,gh1zp3b,And also what could they do to raise the stakes for another movie? They jumped from killing a bunch of people with gas to omnicide.
145,gh1pixh,"I'm not even sure what it meant...like...it was built up so hard and end of the day it crapped out in the first fight.

Seemed like it was entirely for the trailer and that was it."
146,gh1zblc,It was built to repel men.... not apex predators
147,gh3m2b2,They switched it up at least by allowing the nerdy girl who has become hot the ability to renounce her new hotness in order to help save the planet from endless nuclear bombs. To which she promptly says No fucking way I’m all cool and hot now”
148,gh57f6w,I don’t even understand the point of making the movie take place in 1984 because nothing about the movies aesthetic makes me feel like this took place in the 80’s outside of like three scenes where the main source of humor is “look how funny these clothes are!”
149,gh1rij0,Those nukes took the life of some innocent non-nuclear missiles who never hurt anyone.
150,gh2esbn,"> but Steve has to take an innocent man's life to appear?

Not to mention that a glorious hero like Wonder Woman showed no concern, nor did she even question the fact some innocent person had been replaced or erased from the planet. It made her seem like even more of a shallow character to be so excited that her boyfriend is back that she just can't find the time to take a moment and wonder, ""wait.... what happened to the guy who's body he took over?!""."
151,gh1qwjh,"I think it was because Dianna wished upon the actual stone of the god of lies. And the stone itself made it half believable. Normal monkeys paw dynamics mean the consequences must *slowly* reveal themselves, are ironic, and must be proportional to the greed of your wish. Which is why “I wish for coffee” guy only had the coffee be a bit too hot.

Maxwell deep in his Cocaine/wish binge was like “fuck it, the missiles and the Porches appear out of thin air! And the consequences are whatever I want or need from you at this very instant!”"
152,gh20p60,"why did the Russian nukes in the air disappear when the wish was un-done? Only the US ones were wished for, the Russian ones were “real”..."
153,gh1s24k,"Or one little kid going ""I wish everything was normal"""
154,gh241o6,Wishing for world peace is also pretty standard
155,gh20bo7,And there's a runway with a manned control tower and functional radar? And a *Smithsonian police*? *What?!*
156,gh1q9dr,"Plus he would’ve needed to refuel at least 5 times in that jet, let alone he moved from flying planes made from literal sticks and cloth to supersonic jets in an instant"
157,gh2fm1j,"I honestly thought that he was and that’s why he was getting such headaches after every wish, that he was slowly turning into citrine... that would have been kind of cool."
158,gh29p1c,"""I wish to be the stone!""

\*turns into the stone, later Diana tracks it down and destroys it\*

\- HISHE"
159,gh1ptw2,"Very accurate! 

It was about the time they were driving after Lords convoy k thought to myself ""there sure hasn't been much wonder woman in this wonder woman movie...""

I guess the filmmakers had the exact same realisation because her costume suddenly changed and she was kicking trucks."
160,gh1uyje,The opening sequence was 15 minutes before the title card popped up and then we had another 20 minutes of her being a hero. I feel like we had two openers and they said to keep both in.
161,gh1w4fo,I paused it during the party scene right when Wiig walked in and the movie was already 40 minutes in. I was shocked since literally nothing happened to justify that runtime.
162,gh2xt3t,Or what cultural anthropologist has no-questions-asked access to jets?
163,gh3oluw,It was the 80s baby. We all played a little fast and loose.
164,gh2w22o,Because the darkness hides the atrocious CGI...
165,gh1x96k,Not to mention... What the hell was that whole sequence supposed to establish? It was overlong and showed nothing we didn't already know about the character.
166,gh1pnl1,They didn't even bother setting it up with like a throw away line about forth of july plans or something. Also nobody's dressed like its july. Barbara was walking around in a fur coat!
167,gh1n4si,"The whole time I was thinking ""wouldn't it be really dangerous to fly a plane through fireworks?"" but maybe I just don't know what I'm talking about"
168,gh1ob12,"4th of July. In DC. The hottest, most humid time of year. 

Let’s wear a track suit."
169,gh1muh7,Also flying the jet through those fire works wouldve taken all of 2 seconds and yet we got a 5 minute scene of what the fuck is going on?
170,gh329pv,She didn’t know if she was in Wonder Woman or a sequel of Cats.
171,ghbbp7q,"More likely she didn't promote it because she felt like HBO had screwed her by releasing it on streaming (and thus losing out on the Box Office bonus she hoped for). [Gadot and Jenkins got bonuses regardless](https://screenrant.com/wonder-woman-1984-gal-gadot-bonus-hbo-max/), but I haven't seen anything saying Pascal, Pine, or Wiig got anything."
172,gh2v077,"Yup, I don't know how anyone saw that finished project and didn't try to have them fix the CG once they delayed the release. They had an extra year to fix it there was no reason it had to look so bad besides WB just trying to cut their losses."
173,gh1j6f9,Right? I expected to find out that the guy had just died or something but nope they just highjacked his body and his consciousness was pushed away somewhere?
174,gh1j7aw,"In that final scene Diana is thinking to herself, ""You don't know me but I've seen your penis."""
175,gh1kcv5,Diana was so mindless in this. Seemed like she was just reacting to everything. Her 'heroic' moment was just an IRON GIANT 'You Choose' speech at the end
176,gh1k9y3,"And she IMMEDIATELY had sex with him, after asking ZERO questions about how the mechanics of his survival worked"
177,gh1jw10,Did that guy have a job? Friends? Family? Is he dead? Sleeping? Trapped in his body? Is Diana paying his rent? Can he sue for trauma? Did Wonder Woman just RAPE A MAN?
178,gh1jesf,Yeah. Definitely feels like lazy writing not figuring out a better way for him to come back.
179,gh1m0f8,imagine if it was superman sleeping with a lois lane in another woman's body. So weird that they didn't write this better.
180,gh29kub,Why does DC want all of their movies to be tragically long ass epics?
181,gh1sce3,I thought the movie was going to end at the White House... but then I thought “wait this is Barbara’s and Diana’s first conflict” so I knew there was more coming up. But I didn’t know it was going to be for so much longer 😭
182,gh3au5t,"it was set in the 80s, but it's disappointing because I think we all thought it would CELEBRATE the 80s like stranger things. Even the trailer played that up. But in the end it's more like watching a movie that just happened to be filmed in that time period."
183,gh278pa,"“All of the civilizations had mysterious catastrophic collapses”

Ah yes. The completely unstudied history of Rome’s demise."
184,gh1z0ld,"That scene was almost like a parody. Typical trope of the good hero saving the innocent people and letting the bad guys go, but they were in the middle of the desert."
185,gh1msig,She needs her heart broken to fly. Duh. Favorite part was when she was like “Fuck I forgot my armor better turn around”
186,gh1pv53,"Movie Trailer: I'm fucking badass, look at me using a lasso on the lightning. Hype it up, baby!

Movie: I'll learn to fly right before that scene; lol wtf am I doing using a lasso on lightning. I can fly. 

Turns out the coolest part of the trailer was a pointless scene."
187,gh1p00o,[deleted]
188,gh1rfxx,I mean she was a master Javelin thrower at 12 but was like no Supes you should definitely fly this spear up there and die in BvS.
189,gh1upbo,"They also use ""getting over Steve"" as her arc in both this and JL. How empowering is a female protagonist when she can't move on after losing a boyfriend for EIGHTY YEARS."
190,gh1unpt,"Also, the woman who made the wish died...and came back to life a few minutes later. So how did she know to renounce her wish? 

The convincing billions to renounce their wish part was idiotic as fuck. I'd rather they had just made everything turn back to normal when Max renounced his wish."
191,gh2npvh,"“This is a kids movie Pedro but it’s set in 1984 and we need you to act coked up out of your mind”

“On it!”"
192,gh1z75a,He acts the shit out of everything.
193,gh2wq57,Pedro and Chris were the best parts of this movie
194,gh2rgym,he carried it. without him i would’ve turned it off halfway through
195,gh48kib,"I loved how he showed up initially and was just hamming it up full on, then switches to desperate grifter, then megalomaniacal, then redemptive good dad. He gives it his all.

Everyone’s shitting on the film, rightly so in its got a lot of nonsensical parts but I was still enjoying it for the performances alone."
196,gh2ah7b,Definitely getting the Jeremy Irons in Dungeons and Dragons vibe.
197,gh1zl3m,"yeah, as shitty as his character was he still managed to be enigmatic. he went full 90s action villain lmao"
198,gh2pmuh,He was the only good thing about the film. Everything else was so cringe and bad.
199,gh46tbn,"Well you see in the first movie and Batman vs. Superman she's been laying low for all these years BUT apparently that's not the case at all. She's been doing all kinds of crazy mind blowing shit for years, but winks and says, this is our secret and somehow nobodies ever heard of her. 

Worst AtTemPT to preserve continuity ever. God this movie is so bad!"
200,gh31m4c,Was that before or after she destroyed the cameras that had already recorded her swinging through the mall.
201,gh2c907,And then she does neither of those thirty years later
202,gh2aofa,"Flying like Thor too, by propelling herself with her lasso spinning."
203,gh1j5t1,"""I RENOUNCE my wish!"" 

Proceeds to get on a presidential helicopter, fly to the white house, and find his kid who's somehow in the woods now. What?!?"
204,gh1ky73,"I, DECLARE, BANKRUPTCY!"
205,gh1oaql,I’m pretty upset that Max undoing his wish didn’t undo everyone else’s wishes. Like how are you gonna get EVERYONE to renounce their wish? Just get the one guy to renounce it which reverses all of the wishes he granted.
206,gh1xls8,"I don't get how this exists in the DCEU. Like before Man of Steel nothing major seemed to have happened before, but apparently in 1984 for a day everyone's wishes were being granted, and thousands of nukes showed up out of nowhere almost ending the world."
207,gh1r3hu,"Swinging from live wires: Ay-okay.
Same live wire in water: Ouch that stings!"
208,gh3tijk,They barely used Wonder Woman
209,gh1ph16,Actually thought Jim Carrey would have made a solid Lord for a while there.
210,gh1klwn,"This confused me as well. Like I understand the odd scene being off but every action scene looked cheap as fuck. Don’t even get me started on that final battle vs Barbara - hard to follow, boring, lack of weight to their punches and awful CGI."
211,gh1ry99,The easy to access plane was maintained and filled with gas and a WWI pilot with potential PTSD was able to fly perfectly through fireworks.
212,gh1u67n,"Same goes for her strength. She struggles with the padlock at Black Gold, but then pushes a loaded military truck sideways down the road at highway speeds. Then only moments she can't push apart the two much smaller APCs crushing her."
213,gh1mm2t,Zeus is her father she can control electricity in the comics
214,gh1m4kw,I noticed the similarities too. A few minutes after Ares & Cheetah revealed themselves they’re defeated.
215,gh1mvfo,"I thought it was just me.  One of the reasons I enjoyed the first film is that Diana didn’t feel like a floaty fairy when she moved.  She’s an Amazonian not a VS model.  She had weight and athleticism to her movements then, this time she felt like she want even playing by the same physics as everyone else."
216,gh1mi9z,"The physics were really bad. The lasso stuff, the scene where WW swooped up the two children in Egypt like none of them had mass or weight. I can get over poor physics in CGI if I'm into the story... so not here, unfortunately."
217,gh1k6f6,that’s my biggest problem. Liked the movie overall but the action scenes looked so light. I think the first one was a little like that but they took it to a whole new level here
218,gh1o12e,The scene in Egypt where Diana was running with the convoy looked absolutely terrible at times.
219,gh1pl0r,"When she gets out of the car and ""runs"". It was like they had Gal leisurely jogging in front of a green screen."
220,gh1lc4y,I’m baffled. This movie has been sitting on a shelf for over a year now. What happened?
221,gh1mlze,"Kristopher Polaha (after seeing Wonder Woman): ""I wish I land the part of Diana's  boyfriend in the sequel.

Monkey's Paw: ""Wish Granted""

Kristopher Polaha: Cool. I wonder what kind of action fight scenes I'll be in? How I'll save the day? I wonder how many time Gal and I will smooch?"
222,gh1ltwd,"Polaha; “Sweet, I this film is going to be a great way for me to break out of Hallmark movies. So what do I do?”            
Casting Director: “So it is going to be Christmas and you are going to see Gal.”         
Polaha: “Okay, and then do I fight some bad guys and do more than one kiss at the end of the film.”         
Casting Director: “Well earlier you show up and say one line. But don’t worry you return at the end and you talk about how beautiful Christmas is. She compliments your outfit and you leave.”        
Polaha: “This is just a Hallmark movie without me kissing someone.”"
223,gh1lgyl,"Overlooked part: “I don’t want to be like anyone or anything anymore.”  Proceeds to transform into a villain named Cheetah, an existing animal that was never named on screen except in subtitles."

225,gh1j831,"It was too hot, he said it when he got it"
226,gh1kj70,The toppings contain potassium benzoate. That's bad.
227,gh21xg0,"Steve Trevor showing up would have been a lot better if Maxwell Lord had the telepathic powers he had in the comics. Use the powers to make Wonder Woman think he's alive again, manipulate her into doing Lord's bidding or to distract her from whatever his evil plan would have been instead of the stupid wish shit we got."
228,gh4bl8w,"This is an example of how sloppy the movie is written.  The entire movie is about the power of the truth, and Diana flat out lies to Max Lord.  She could have simply said ""I don't watch much television"" and it would have made more sense."
229,gh1pt6q,Needed to set up the weightless physics as the norm.
230,gh1ra75,"It’s not even Olympics , it’s Amazonian Next Top Ninja Warrior, live tonight at 7:30."
231,gh1xjjd,"They needed to build up to the moment when Robin Wright says, ""cheating is bad,"" and then completely forget to recall that moment at any time later in the movie."
232,gh1wclz,I think she was wearing it under her clothes. I thought it showed her taking her shirt off as she got out of the truck and the armor was on underneath.

Low bar, but yeah"
237,gh1oeiz,Pretty much what happened tbh

240,gh1nsoy,[deleted]
241,gh59jfx,WHAT THE FUCK DID THIS EVEN MEAN
242,gh1l23r,Also I don’t get how Diana wasn’t the least bit bothered she essentially pulled him out of heaven.
243,gh1mwza,He thought he went to the good place. Chidi and Eleanor don’t fix the afterlife until later than 1984. Had been hundreds of years since the last person got into the good place.
244,gh281u6,"I honestly wished the movie was as campy as Pedro Pascal, it did not need to take itself as seriously as it did."
245,gh5esa4,Well it's a good thing she's transitioning to  *checks notes*  Star Wars.  Shit...
246,gh1p6za,"They needed fireworks, but didn't bother to establish it was the 4th of July in any other way.

Tldr. Bad bad bad bad writing. Not that this is what makes it bad, it's the least of the scripts problems, but if they can't make a coherent plot, there's no way they care about details like this."
247,gh1pmh0,"I kept thinking, wait why did she lasso them AGAIN and drag them into the bannister AGAIN just to jump down all weird. That scene went on for WAAAAAAY too long."
248,gh1s6hq,"Gadot wasn’t selling it for me this time, especially considering she basically saved the world with a speech.

And as much as hate to rag on a child actor, Max’s son was not great. 

Liked Kristen Wiig though."
249,gh1uqcs,">The robbing scene in the mall felt almost like a parody scene haha

I felt like I watched Diana glide around that mall for 30 minutes"
250,gh1tr5q,I thought the mall scene was so silly and slapstick it was going to be revealed it was a tv show. It wasn’t.  And the movie never got better.
251,gh1kve7,"Chris Pine was great. Pedro Pascal chews scenery like the best of best even if it makes less than zero sense. Wiig did a good job considering what she was given. Gadot? Never been a great actress and it shows here a LOT given that the script was not all that good either. 

Lackluster acting plus bad writing equals bad, bad movie."
252,gh1n3w6,"Oh, and enough fuel to fly from Washington DC to Cairo... and back again."
253,gh1kicv,"Dude even called them ""jets"" which I doubt a WW1 pilot would do."
254,gh1omx6,Pedro Pascal do be having a father theme in his works this year.
255,gh2qw6u,"Things that give me some hope for RS: Geoff Johns won’t be anywhere near the script & Disney wouldn’t let a Star Wars movie release with special effects this fucking terrible (yes Star Wars has had its share of questionable shots but never an entire movie of crap CGI). 

But overall, yeah I’m worried. This seems to be her first complete misfire though so maybe not all is lost yet"
256,gh1q2pp,"She stretched her arm in front of her parallel to the ground, so its flying according to superman"
257,gh297yp,"When she dropped the thieves on the police car they would have absolutely died or been critically injured... I mean they must have fallen several stories, and absolutely crushed the car in. Negative effect of Barbara (Cheetah) was that she would lose her empathy. All the rest of the things you brought up... yeah I've got nothing lol"
258,gh1jl35,"It was convenient that the kid came running out of the forest adjacent to where his helicopter landed at the end.
Like the city is a warzone and he finds his kid immediately by getting out of the chopper and yelling."
259,gh1q0md,"I felt they should have had him really bond with his son a little more. Instead, it showed how annoyed he was that it was his weekend to have him again, so I didn’t believe that he’d give up all his power for the kid."

269,gh1kflo,"It just got more and more absurd as it went on

Here I was thinking Steve magically knowing how to fly a fucking jet was the most absurd thing I’d see in that movie. Like knowing how to fly WW1 planes *does not* translate to fighter jets lol

Then the rest happened"
270,gh1jhnf,I enjoyed watching Steve explore the 80s more than anything.
271,gh1kxi3,"I hate to say it, but I think the film's biggest issue was its writing. 

They didn't bring Allan Heinberg back, who was responsible for most of the first film's script, and instead Patty Jenkins and Geoff Johns got top billing, the latter of whom mostly writes for DC shows on the CW. As good as a director Jenkins is, most directors also aren't spectacular writers, and it kind of showed here that she didn't have a partner who could really lead her through the process.

It was really episodic and didn't really have any semblance of a plot or direction for its first 90 minutes. I don't think its nearly as bad as some people are making it out to be, but it really, truly needed a better writer and screenplay."
272,gh1ku2i,"I thought Patty did a great job with the first one, but this was rough. This movie was legitimately an hour too long, and the screenplay was just messy and contrived in general. Makes me nervous that she’s taking on the next Star Wars movie, but I know she’s capable and not everyone can have a perfect track record so gonna stay positive!"
273,gh1wehk,"YUP

Movie was trash, no question but my mans Pedro did a great job chewing the scenery like it was fucking sugar coated"
274,gh2b8gd,"That was actually a ticket receipt, not the ticket itself.  They print them on the same-shaped paper as tickets/boarding passes.

Everything else is on point."
275,gh1luuy,"I think the idea with Lord is that he just wanted to have a successful business, but the power of the stone caused him to want more and more as he dived deeper into chaos. It’s not explained well.

Kristen Wiig was good but definitely not used well towards the end. I wish Barbara had a “come back” moment after she recanted her wish and realizes she doesn’t need to be Diana to be liked, and they could have buried the hatchet and she could have gotten her guy. Comeuppance! Instead, she stopped being cat lady and I’m sure this scene got cut for a shoehorned, super obvious Christmas reshoot scene."
276,gh1ld19,His motive was to save Grogu
277,gh1lynf,"Maybe it’s because I have little knowledge of Cheetah or had low expectations of Wiig being a super villian, but I think she knocked it out of the park with what she was given (let me be clear I enjoy Wiig as a comedic actress, but if someone said name ten female actors to be Cheetah she wouldn’t be on my list). Maxwell goal was to be more and to have no one be able to view him as someone lesser."
278,gh1qtgv,I swear those bank robbers could’ve been replaced by the three stooges and it wouldn’t have made a difference.
279,gh1knbe,">Chris Pine reacting to everything like this: 👁👄👁

Somehow didn't know what fireworks were."
280,gh1jmxj,Steve existed more just as a direct plot device for Diana this time around rather than as a character himself. It certainly fits the story but it’s also unfortunate.
281,gh1jz9z,He has no idea how an escalator works although kids can figure it out quickly.  And then he flies a jet no problem.
282,gh1z1z9,"Yup, HBO pulled a fast one on us. They kept a lid on how shitty it was and parlayed it into a bunch of new subscriptions."
283,gh38adv,"That book/writing part was semi-realistic, but that guy was not Mayan. See https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_codices."
284,gh6ryig,Because every 80's movie has to have a mall scene because malls were big back then.
285,gh2f1eo,We just call that Mega-Chemo
286,gh4m951,"I don't know, the movie didn't really make it clear enough if Maxlord renouncing canceled all the wishes or if everyone had to cancel their individual wishes. Because I bet a lot of parents would be fine giving away their life force (or what ever Maxlord asked for) for their kid to be cancer free, for example."
287,gh1uv83,The entire movie had protesters holding no nuke signs. You’re telling me none of them (even while the nukes are literally flying over them and the emergency alert system is saying they have 4 minutes to find shelter) wished for the nukes to go away?
288,gh1qizh,"First in, first out."
289,gh27rfg,"There had to have been thousands of nihilists wishing for the immediate apocalypse, there is just no way earth survived even five minutes of an entire country having the power to wish whatever they individually want. And then what, *everyone* takes back their wish?! Not to mention things seemed oddly normal? Like if millions are wishing for whatever shit they want there’d be dinosaurs and giant rick and morty characters destroying New York."
290,gh65osi,It wasn't even her boyfriend. She was willing to kill a random stranger dude for it.
291,gh2hla1,And stole 100% of his scenes.
292,gh1vvyc,Surely tons of people were wishing for dead relatives to come back at the end too
293,gh28ro2,Steve Trevor was in this movie because Chris Pine.
294,gh1rn3z,On like the fuckin freeway at that. He covered some ground
295,gh1u9j8,My girl and I were like “why are there zombies chasing a kid?”
296,gh1p3g3,Probably has the shits now though
297,gh1t0vm,"Nah, it was so they could make a toy with her in it to sell to kids."
298,gh26xfj,It killed me when she was like “everyone gave her their armor so she could stand and keep the men back” and it cuts to some eyes sitting in a scrap heap with Game of Thrones extras going bananas outside.
299,gh27pkf,"I AM NO MAN!

*Stabs Wonder Woman*"
300,gh7rhnr,Even they forgot it was set in 1984 with the modern signs in the DC Metro
301,gh7ynxv,"The president could have been Ronald Reagan, but nope, was a generic dumb movie president"
302,ghdw3jr,I think the only reason it's set in the 80s is so that the nuclear war scenario between USA and Russia seems more plausible.
303,gh58nay,Yep. About the only thing that it set up was fanny pack jokes
304,gh7ydao,"In a movie *filled* with bad plot points, this absolutely takes the cake. 

If for no other reason than it makes WW an objectively terrible person. 

And they never even let her atone for it. Even when she recants her wish, she never showed concern or thought for the dude. 

What the fuck are they thinking in the writer's room?"
305,gh1tzxs,About the cocain thing. They definitely had a shot of Max in his office taking a quick snort then wiping it away
306,gh2i2qr,"Speaking of wishes by kids, where's the bat shit insane things 4 year old are wishing for? Dinosaurs, unicorns, etc.

Also the laws of the wishes were changed on a whim. Some were manifested vaguely (i wished for a farm guy having cows dropped next to him) some were manifested with logic (nukes being placed into silos all around the US)."
307,gh2m2l3,"Yeah, movies always seem to forget that the Air and Space Museum is in the middle of downtown D.C. and doesn't have its own active airstrip."
308,gh1y1yp,[deleted]
309,gh4cmhg,"I thought that at first too, but that would have been way too logical for this movie."
310,gh4rd1x,"There was something in his comic book origins about his powers of subconscious suggestion causing mental strain / nosebleeds, that I guess they felt they had to (try) to tie in."
311,gh29nd6,"There was a disappointing lack of wonder woman for a wonder woman movie. 

&#x200B;

Even her cool golden angel outfit barely got used."
312,gh1s17z,The entire Themyscira sequence served no purpose and could’ve been cut.
313,gh4bs1m,"I mean, have you *seen* how hot this lady is?"
314,gh4mfk7,"To fully functional, maintained, fueled and most likely combat ready fighter jets that double as a museum exhibit."
315,gh3vyxw,This is the best explanation. For sooo many parts of this movie
316,gh23u3r,"For the trailer. Between that, the golden armor and whipping the lightning I was SOLD to see this movie. And none of those things were important to the plot. Take them all out everything still turns out the same. We got bamboozled."
317,gh28seh,"I thought the movie was garbage but the scene established the idea that the truth was more important than cheating to get what you want. So I can say I'm glad that they showed her that importance and that it was important for her speech at the end.

But man... Really disappointed in this movie. But at least Soul was great!"
318,gh1qxbr,She told that homeless guy to stay warm. In July. In D.C.
319,gh1pws0,"I was thinking, ""wouldn't a guy that died in an exploding aircraft possibly have some PTSD issues to deal with here?""

EDIT: Ok, literally 10 of you have let me know he said he didn't remember his death. I got it. Frankly, that doesn't change the fact that this is what I was thinking when I saw the scene, and by the end of the movie, I had no interest in going back to check."
320,gh1prnt,Also Steve somehow didn't know what fireworks were. And decided to fly through them after knowing nothing about them.
321,gh6u27m,CW's Flash has a better running CG than this…
322,gh1x23l,"So many questions! Was he aware? In some sort of magic coma? Did anyone miss him? Did he lose his job after being MIA for like 3 days? 

Would have been great if they ran into his neighbor or family member. Watching Steve bumble through the conversation would have put the conflict front and center. At least that would lay the ground work for an actual moral dilemma for Diana vs the somewhat selfish ""oh no, my powers!"" resolution. This whole plotline honestly felt like an excuse to give Diana transportation to Cairo."
323,gh215yx,"Dude went to bed one night then came to in the middle of the street several days later, in the midst of a massive riot as the world learns magic is real and that it can both cause and reverse nuclear war. He’s bruised from being in a fight and (though he doesn’t remember it), just participated in an assault on the White House, from which their were many witnesses. Also, he hasn’t shown up to work for the past three days.

Honestly, the movie where he tries to figure out what the fuck happened and piece his life back together is kinda better than this one."
324,gh1jd7a,Movie would be a 10/10 if it ended with her saying “you got a rocking penis.”
325,gh1l3zr,Maybe they just cuddled all night :)
326,gh1maal,Now he’s been fired for no call no show at work.
327,gh1l5vx,Didn't think I'd have to consider if wonder woman raped a dude but it's 2020 still so here we are.
328,gh1ktyi,I mean it's a super hero movie. They could have just had him come back. No need for the body hijacking at all.
329,gh2l1eo,"Carthage too. No, I can tell you exactly what happened to them."
330,gh2t4k1,The first movie annoyed me as a history teacher. This one was on a whole different level
331,gh2umhf,[deleted]
332,gh3ccjz,"Some random ""Mayan"" with a book just pulls the plot together for them."
333,gh2503f,Also Steve just knew to fire that missile?? And knew how to fire that missile???
334,gh1sfeg,"my little brother pointed this out to me. He was like ""she flew all that way just to go to her apartment?"""
335,gh1xp88,"You forget the: I also have armor with wings, but they are not really for flying, just to look cool as I drop them on the ground."
336,gh1sq62,"""oh yeah and I can turn just about any object invisible indefinitely and perhaps permanently but I don't that's ever gonna come in handy beyond this one use case"""
337,gh237fa,"did the guy who got coffee in the first wish have ot renounce his wish?   How about the ""clear the traffic guy?  Did the people who didnt know they got wishes granted have to renounce their wishes?

This movie, if you think about it for more the a few seconds get worse and worse."
338,gh3j0r5,I NEED MY VITAMINS
339,gh2rtox,You ever see The Great Wall? One of the shittiest movies I’ve ever seen but Pascal gives 110% like he’s going for an Oscar. Dude never phones it in.
340,gh1z9k9,"Yep, I love him for it"
341,gh552gn,"Yeah to me Pedro was ignoring the fact that he was in a bad movie and trying anyway, while Chris kept turning the bad movie into an enjoyable one for a few seconds"
342,gh5gbnd,I remember thinking that they should just cut out all the Wonder Woman stuff and just have the movie be called The Increasingly Poor Decisions of Maxwell Lord.
343,gh73xqm,"Also her partaking in an adult Amazon competition as a kid, even though the first film established she only did that as a teen?

Her having new powers, like making things invisible, and flying, which she never uses in BvS or Justice League.

And as you said, the supposed plot point of her hiding from the world since Trevor's death...except she's apparently been saving people for the last 100 years, because they show pictures of her at different historical events?

Maybe they're just trying to ignore the continuity and leave the other films behind, but it was still really jarring."
344,gh1kjuq,"“I renounce my wish! I freely give up all the ill-gotten power and influence that’s gotten me here!

...

Oh hey if you guy’s are taking this chopper back to the White House can I hitch a ride? I need to pick up my kid.”"
345,gh1xspp,"Yeah, Max renouncing his wish should've just reset time to when he became the stone. It would've allowed everything to go back to how it was for the world without anyone knowing, while Max, Diana, and Barbara would retain their memories, having made their wishes before."
346,gh1z88j,But doesn’t kill apparently. Just makes her stop fighting... for some reason?
347,gh1q15h,Interesting comment b/c Lord reminded me of Carrey's Riddler in 'Batman Forever' - taking over the TV waves to gain control over a mass population.
348,gh1n28g,"Barbara using electrical lines as a sling shot not once but TWICE! I mean Jesus fuck, it felt like it was directed by a fucking 10 year old."
349,gh1tko8,"All the way from Washington D.C. to Cairo, no less. They would be lucky to get 1000km with the average fighter plane equipped with fuel pods."
350,gh24c2y,That seems like a superpower that should come up more often
351,gh1pbww,"Those kids for sure got broken ribs. Brain damage. Did you see how stiff they looked. Wth! 

When they land it looks like WW is rolling with child mannequins."
352,gh1q9at,"The lassoing onto a missile. 

HER LITERALLY FLYING BECAUSE STEVE SAID THE WORDS GLIDING AND AIR."
353,gh1upma,"When she tumbled with the kids you could tell the kids were mannikins, like blatantly."
354,gh1sn36,"Yeah, the background ... Beyond obvious green screen. 

Really weird considering the budget."
355,gh1qce1,There’s something really freaky about how shes always so upright. And it’s unclear what’s actually making her fast. Are her legs going faster? Longer stride? What’s actually propelling her forward?
356,gh1mszr,They clearly spent no extra money on the CGI with all the time delays lmao. Like they sat on the film for a year and didnt use the time at all.
357,gh1mmuy,"And there wasn't even a line about her getting the speed of a cheetah or something to explain it. Hell, there wasn't even a transformation scene. Like when Lord is giving her powers they should have shown her clothes busting from her muscles inflating and fur showing on her body. Instead she just smiles then a few minutes later shows up as a monster."
358,gh267x3,"One of the early rumors was that Pedro was playing Hades, god of the underworld and of business."
359,gh26dq9,"Right? That whole scene was so unnatural, I thought it was just because they were doing Themyscara Olympics, but nope, the whole movie felt weird and weightless. 

When she saved the bride from falling off the bridge prior to the hilariously awful mall sequence, I knew I was in for something pretty bad."
360,gh1nj8q,"Hey, Diana had a photo of her helping free concentration camp prisoners. They showed it for like 3 seconds.

Which is also kind of a gross photo to keep on your book shelf.

Why does she need a picture of herself rescuing someone?"
361,gh21gz8,"Maybe she was fighting Super Hitler at that time. If you think Hitler was bad, just be glad you didn't see Super Hitler."
362,gh1tsx6,"Yeah whatever stupid message she was trying to send would have worked better as a YouTube video, and then they could have done something entertaining and fun for the superhero movie maybe"
363,gh1uv91,"I was confused how people heard her speech. Even if a camera was pointed directly at her which I don’t recall happening, she didn’t have a microphone.  She just looked directly at the viewer as if that was enough.  Even if the entire room was made of cameras and some suicidal boom mic operator was nearby, I think the whole “chaotic laughter while a wind from nowhere blows around the room and Max Lord says things like ‘I’ll take your health’” might make viewers wary to make a wish to say the least."
364,gh1n11j,He should be all moody about it like Buffy.
365,gh1tywq,Jeremy Bearimy
366,gh1tb0y,"While Pascal did great with what he was given, the scene with him going full Bruce Almighty at the end granting wishes felt very weird. There's only so much maniacal evil laughter in slo-mo you can take before it gets irritating."
367,gh1vom9,"Yes. It was more excusable in the first one because she was a fish out of water but in this one, you could see it was just Gal Gadot playing herself. The writing didn't help and the story spent way too long with her not being Wonder Woman and just being Diana."
368,gh2180k,"I feel like the only reason they brought Pine back was because he actually has the charisma to carry a blockbuster movie, and without him Gadot is like a beautiful wet mop."
369,gh1swd3,In — what? —  the same night?
370,gh1my0a,"I let that little bit slide,as they went to the aerospace museum and surely that wouldve been explained."
371,gh1n54q,It was convenient that the secret service was willing to give a helicopter lift to now powerless dude back to the White House.
372,gh1ov1r,"It was because there wasn't weight behind it. No leaning into a swing, body was weightless. No one watched any Spider-Man or Tarzan films at all."
373,gh1ryge,There's so much to dissect. So many weird choices.
374,gh1y4t0,"Everything felt unfinished. The script, the editing, the special affects. Was almost like a Twilight Zone episode watching it. The mall robbery scene was straight up bizarre. Diana floated half the time like she was in slow motion. The robbers didn't act human. She didn't subdue any of them before bouncing 50 feet away. And everything involving Trevor was off putting."
375,gh1y2mq,"Even more when you consider that in Justice League, even Batman tells her to stop moping about Steve Trevor."
376,gh1mfa8,And... You mean to tell me a two seater training jet cannot fly from the US to Egypt???
377,gh1mjh5,"Can we also talk about how absurd it is how she then immediately learned how to make an entire jet invisible (probably one of the most practical superpowers ever) from just thinking about how one dude did it to a coffee cup forever ago? *THEN* she ""learned"" how to fly after thinking about Steve talking romantic nonsense about the wind

Edit: I get it. She did it to a cup. Doesn't make it less absurd"
378,gh1kk1s,[deleted]
379,gh1trl9,"Dude, at the halfway point in the movie, I went, ""You're more than an hour into the movie and you're still stuck on setup. WTF is going on?"""
380,gh1ud8h,"No, it was to avenge his murdered sister by the hands of the Lanister soldiers."
381,gh1oe7g,"""oh and let me fly this aircraft into a bunch of detonating explosives""

edit: How could they not use any part of Metallica's ""Ride the Lightning"" even though it came out in 1984 and she literally swung around on lightning and she electrocuted the villain"
382,gh1l6vp,Omg yes! Like his plane and modern planes are so different and she managed to make the jet invisible after it only working on a coffee cup!
383,gh5yrd4,"As an Indian, I was wondering how the fuck Ravi Patel (Indian origin) was playing a Mayan shaman.

https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2201027/"
384,gh24bie,That would have been hilarious if the nukes were appearing and reappearing on both Soviet and US maps and the militaries were all confused
385,gh1xxq6,FIFO this guy has taken Accounting 101
386,gh2hoj9,"I take that back. Diana and Steve in the airplane, just looking at the cloud covered fireworks, Pine didn't overwhelm Godot.

Edit: guys, I didn't mean he isn't as pretty as Professional Model Gal, relax. I think that their acting synergized during that scene. And also during the goodby scene. The pair sometimes play off each other really well."
387,gh28qsx,Then Diana was like “Wish them dead again. Fucking do it.”
388,gh1u8p9,And the next time we see him he just comes out of the shrubs at the White House
389,gh1qce8,"He said when he sipped it “oh it’s too hot.”

Modest wish, modest monkey paw consequence lol."
390,gh1yiry,Moichondizing!
391,gh22cau,Don't forget the Golden Armor Funko Pop to sell to adults
392,gh9bqc5,"I was about to make a comment to my wife during that scene about how the modern day DC Metro wouldn't take much to make it look like the 80s. Then I saw the new digital signs and went, ""well so much for that."""
393,gh2hhxf,"The entire plot-purpose of picking mid 80s was  to draw on the context of a culture where a Max Lord could exist, I assumed. Even if it isn't shown, I'd have to assume he was snorting his company into debt, along with all his other mistakes before he found the artifact."
394,gh2qraq,He does say at one moment “Bring me my vitamins!” I am totally certain he was referring to cocaine.
395,gh2pcgz,"I could probably have forgiven the magical appearance of a runway, but the control tower and smithsonian police was just too much. And literally all just to set up the invisible jet which was never mentioned again and didn't have any lead-up at all."
396,gh2fwmt,"Yup. Dull movie.
Not enough action and Godot struggling to bring life to the character out of costume. And the rest of the cast rarely shine either. Pascal made the most of his character and while Kristen Wiig started strong her character became less and less interesting right up to the dissapointing final fight. And Chris Pine was in some scenes.

Another mess of a DCU movie. Such a shame as the first WW movie was easily one of the best DCU entries. Ignoring the awful ending the first WW was compelling with her in and out of costume."
397,gh1vcw8,Yeah... And spend more of the visual effects budget on the scenes that needed it. There were a few green screen shots that were straight out of a 2009 network series.
398,gh1xk3n,It’s entire purpose was to setup the idea that winning with lies isn’t winning. Way not worth the payoff.
399,gh1wxcy,"Literally the first thing I said when this movie started was “wow, did we need young Diana again?” 

And then that scene went on for like 20 fucking minutes."
400,gh2970c,The marketing team should all get bonuses this year. This movie looked SO DAMN COOL in all the trailers and ads. They made a bad movie look so good.
401,gh2uxh6,Holy crap... Cheetah’s never win.
402,gh20jdd,[deleted]
403,gh1tgow,I'm glad someone else noticed this. Even the guy cheetah beats the shit out of was wearing a trench coat in July. The more you think about this movie the more problems you find. The runtime was also way too long.
404,gh1sxha,I was thinking “does flying a ww1 prop plane really translate 1-to-1 with flying a a modern fighter jet?”
405,gh1sx1x,And fireworks were definitely a thing in Steve’s lifetime.
406,gh1jk2x,I feel bad for the dude. He got down with Wonder Woman and has no fucking memory of it.
407,gh1lqy3,"That would’ve been better, just have Steve return physically rather than hijack another man’s body."
408,gh1lvoq,"Yeah I doubt that anyone would instantly recognize him. It's not like somebody would have stopped and been like ""Hey isn't that Steve Trevor? Pilot and war hero who died over sixty years ago? What is he doing here?"""
409,gh34nmp,"As someone who knows hardly about Rome, it still stuck out."
410,gh1unyl,"DC is small as fuck, she could have ran there in less time. And then we could have explained her flying as due to the wings in the armor. Which would have been consistent with the Justice League and BvS. The writing in this movie..."
411,gh267tl,Also just for merchandising
412,gh2ihhb,Anytime you throw in wishes things get messy quickly unless you are very careful to setup the rules (kinda like time travel)
413,gh4t5bi,"ALISTAIR!!

ALISTAIR!!!!!!"
414,gh1ms9c,"Hahahah exactly!  I renounce all my power, but hey can I still get a ride back to the White House?"
415,gh22tjp,Don't forget the coffee guy.
416,gh1o9bf,I thought: “oh she’s just immune to the electricity” and then she is defeated by getting electrocuted
417,gh1qc0k,A child going from a standstill to 60-80 mph in the blink of an eye would be a gruesome sight to behold
418,gh1s37u,"Those robbers at the beginning of the movie that she just chucks off the roof of a building and land so hard they smash through a car?? 

...yeah, walk that off, boys.  You're fine."
419,gh24yd7,"“Flying is simple. It’s just wind and air. You ride it. It’s like anything, really.”

- Dialogue from a 300 million dollar blockbuster."
420,gh31r9h,She landed SO hard on the little boy. I can't fucking believe they used that shot. I laughed out loud at it.
421,gh1ynhu,"It was like that scene from Spider Man where MJ was just holding a mannequin in a spiderman suit, but at least that has the excuse of being almost 20 years old"
422,gh33wea,"That had me laughing my ass off. Both because of how obviously fake it was and the fact that those ""kids"" got fucking SLAMMED and then just got up and were fine."
423,gh29mgh,The one kid (the one farther away) like literally teleported/vacuumed into her hand at the last second
424,gh29kst,"Her flying too, the first time, just looked like she was hanging on a rope in front of a green screen.

I’m glad I’m not the only one who felt this way."
425,gh25mr8,100% concentrated power of will
426,gh2n9gw,"I remember how they made Captain America runs faster by having him move faster while also pulling a rug on his feet. It looks GOOD.

This looks wrong, but then again physics left the stratosphere for this movie."
427,gh1rhu9,"It's not just the CGI though. During the desert sequence, she opens the door of her car, steps out, rips off her clothes and starts running. It literally looked like the CW Flash. There are thousands of sequences where characters jump out of moving vehicles... Rolling to break momentum is absolutely necessary to make it look realistic. The choices made in this movie were all deliberate."
428,gh1nht1,"Yes, but she mentioned that she likes cheetah patterns high heels in a two second scene early in the movie so there you go"
429,gh279ti,"Oh wow, that would've been amazing. Perhaps a bit too similar to Ares, but at least it would've strengthened WW's identity as part of ancient mythologies. Maybe they could've tied Hades' interest in WW with her killing Ares so it wouldn't have felt like a coincidence."
430,gh1q35j,Where do we go... from here?
431,gh1tjxk,That's still one of the most compelling things to ever come out of a protagonist being magically revived because the show needs to continue.
432,gh1v9hx,Granted! Granted! Granted!
433,gh1z576,"Imagine having to film that scene 
“You’re going to raise your hands a few times and laugh manically for about....5 minutes”"
434,gh2351m,It had no structure and several plot points that were either unexplained or didnt go anywhere. So many choices that led to more questions then answers. The movie had a $200 million dollar budget and I feel like no one sat down and actually read through the entire script from beginning to end.
435,gh227h3,"The robbery scene felt so unreal I started to think the whole scene was them filming a movie or something. It felt like it wasn't really happening, even in the movie world."
436,gh36yw6,"Even Steve at the end of the movie was like “you gotta get over me, there’s a lot of people out here”

C’mon Diana, it’s not cute anymore"
437,gh4y9k1,"When *Batman* tells you to stop moping about someone who got killed, you’ve officially taken it too far."
438,gh1mkgq,That is unfortunately very far down the list of things wrong with that movie lol
439,gh1oqtn,"Honestly, they introduce her learning how to turn invisible, her learning how to fly, and her awesome armor with only like a two line backstory right before the thing happens. 

There was no mystique , no foreshadowing, no build up, no well Written lore in this movie. So baaaaad. 

Like they have the power of Hollywood behind this, Tons of marvel movies for inspiration, and every fucking writer looking for work and that’s what they come up with?"
440,gh1ldgf,Ya I was a bit disappointed in that. I assumed there would be some 1980s plot aspect. Instead I felt like they could have chosen any decade and it would not have mattered.
441,gh1mbwb,Also he was baffled by concepts that were not that wild for his original lifetime. Like a freakin' subway...
442,gh8e2a3,"Honestly, EVERYONE renouncing their wishes was the least believable thing in the whole movie. I've seen 2020."
443,gh1xuez,Lmaooo this movie is hilariously bad
444,gh1rsnm,"Simpsons did it! ""The turkey is a little dry"" line when Homer wishes for a turkey sandwich."
445,gh1te2c,Don't you think that guy has got to be pissed though. People got literally whatever they wished for and this dude wasted it on coffee.
446,gh2l8pp,Can't wait for the Wonder Woman Flame Thrower
447,gh41rhs,She spent fifty years turning a single coffee cup invisible but managed to turn the entire fucking jet like it was no big deal
448,gh2g4v0,"It felt, as per usual for DC, it tried to do too much at once, and ended up not doing anything at all.  

Took too long to get Chris Pine back, took too long for anything to happen with him, then by the time he was gone, the world was already over.   

Introduced the cool armour ""early"" on, did nothing with it, busted it out for one fight that it was irrelevant in and threw it away.  

Opened and ancient evil and then the solution was for everyone on the planet to just say ""yeah nah no thanks"", uh huh okay. 

I was expecting Pascal to take on the strength and power of everyone on the planet and go for an insane 1v1 with Wonder Woman, instead he remembered he had a kid and decided that love beats unlimited power. Not a bad message, but one that doesn't really match his character (as it was presented, at least)."
449,gh25exz,No kidding. This movie was ROUGH with dodgy CGI and nonsensical physics. That lasso was just a get out of physics free card all movie.
450,gh20x69,"But she was also a kid against adults, so..."
451,gh1ytrm,"When she broke the thing with the bow, I was like “Ok, she won”, but nope, that was just stage 1."
452,gh2gip6,DC makes fantastic trailers. Both the Suicide Squad and Batman v Superman trailers generated a ton of hype.
453,gh2434e,"It looked absolutely nothing like 1980s DC. Didn't really feel like the 80s at all for that matter. They couldn't even cash in on the 80s nostalgia wave right. And it's weird because *Joker* actually did feel very much like it was set in late 70s/early 80s NYC despite never explicitly specifying the time period and technically being set in ""Gotham"" rather than New York. So I know they are capable of properly evoking the feel of a specific time and place. But it's like they just didn't even try at all for this one. They just SAID it was the 80s and expected us to just buy it without putting any effort whatsoever into making it actually feel like an 80s setting. And yeah, DC today looks identical to DC in the movies. It's painfully obvious they shot there and didn't even bother to change the slightest details to make it look period correct."
454,gh1xwn0,Almost like a kid telling a lie that keeps folding into itself and getting worse and worse and longer and longer
455,gh22ope,"Oh don't even get me started. They stole a static display aircraft that would absolutely not be full of fuel or regularly maintained and needs an external generator to start plus is a small attack aircraft that in no way has the range to fly from DC to Cairo, flown by a man who last flew a radial piston prop plane and was just introduced to gas turbine engines and who has no idea of the performance envelope of the bird including rotation, stall, and approach speeds."
456,gh1tyvk,Along with Subways and escalators.
457,gh1t8pz,"I see no real reason why the bodyjacking has to be there.       
It does add some interesting questions about ethics...but none of which the film wants to address. So why add it?       
Why not just have steve? The film handwaves ""he's not steve, but we're using steves actor anyway"". So...why?"
458,gh23erh,"""It was such a good coffee 😭"""
459,gh1qii3,Spiderman may be the only comic ive personally read in which the sudden force of being grabbed and stopped actually had a negative impact and killed Gwen.
460,gh1zhcf,And her hair blowing in the wrong direction
461,gh2idkq,Luckily Gal distracted us from Pedro's repetitive lines with all her emoting.
462,gh23ll9,"Not to mention the fact that she didn't need the armor at all when she used it, right? She didn't use it the entire time she was losing her powers. She used it after she got her powers back or am I totally misremembering that part?"
463,gh1y6pg,I think the power of Hollywood was the  main issue with this. Movies that make no sense like this are what happens when you write a movie by committee.
464,gh1p7yp,"I get it, actually. There's clearly some material there, particularly in Pedro Pascal's last sequence of taking off the jacket and looking like he stepped out of the Wolf of Wall Street, and him being an oil ponzi scheme guy two years before the crash, that was meant to be commentary on the relentless hedge fund capitalism that characterized the 80s. He's like a knockoff version of that futurama ""80s business guy"" character, the one with Boneitis.

But I don't know if the script wasn't developed enough or if it was too overdeveloped and too much was cut, but the only time I realized they were trying to say ""look you CAN'T have it all and those get rich quick 80s business guys didn't get it and stock brokers and hedge fund managers now don't get it and you have to live your life and appreciate what's around you"" was in Gal's cringey staring down the barrel directly to me speech where she explicitly said that. 

Poorly done."
465,gh1rhh3,"How else would they have had an excuse to make cool 80s aesthetic ""Thor: Ragnarok"" knock-off posters?"
466,gh1pxvv,"Yeah I was like dude that's just a fucking train, you should know what that is."
467,gh8rn42,"Honestly, it all should have disappeared when Max renounced. Didn't see the need for the kumbaya type ending. Also for everyone in the world wishing crap, the chaos in the city was pretty mundane. Where the fuck are the raining meatballs and unicorns and shit?"
468,gh2ee3o,Like the stiff-as-boards dolls that WW swung over the road and scooped up before they could be hit by the military truck?
469,gh20w6v,"There were just so many things that did not make any sense. It was laughable. The cop screaming, ""It is chaos out here, what do you want me to do!"" I actually started laughing."
470,gh226xh,What DEMON FROM HELL created theeeee! *sobs*
471,gh4671c,"While losing her powers, no less"
472,gh2t3l4,"The armor just amazes me! I told my wife ""It's like they realized the armor was going to be hard to do fight scenes with, so they just made Diana stand there till Cheetah destroyed the wings."""
473,gh2oj9n,"Strongest armor ever that held back the armies of man and never broke...got shredded by a crazy cat lady haha

Pascal was great for the role given to him, but the writing could have been much better for the main villain."
474,gh2a19k,Lol when it was “whipping around” as she stumbles backwards in the...wish chamber. The physics there were hilarious
475,gh24mb1,"Like if they would have gone with Diana just entering adulthood or even teen Diana it could have worked, but she was a literal child competing with trained warriors."
476,gh42hab,"Don't tell me those group of attractive, racially diverse teens wholesomely doing breakdancing in the park wasn't 80's enough for you?"
477,gh39ssg,"The digital signs in the Metro...Like, that's an easy fix if they cared..."
478,gh2hv34,What I'm gathering from this thread is as a pilot don't watch this film.
479,gh2nrxt,And stole the plane from a Museum that didn't open until 2003... The Udvar-Hazy Center.
480,gh1v89w,I thought I was going crazy with that.
481,gh1vmt6,So focused by this and fireworks. Like dude anyone bother to check any details?
482,gh1zdqm,The were in London in the first movie in 1918 and London's first subway was literally in 1863.
483,gh1u7iw,And then there’s The Boys.
484,gh1sxgd,"Dude also lived and worked in London, which had a subway before ww1.  Even that specific kind of train should not have been a novelty, let alone a mindblowing unfathomable tunnel of magic."
485,gh2qvqe,What were those dumbass kids doing anyway. They really couldn’t see/hear some big ass tanks driving down the road with literally nothing else around them?
486,gh2lsr8,Once she's holding them all the military trucks avoid them anyways. She didn't need to do anything there
487,gh29e9a,"lol he was like ""Somebody help me"". Gave me a laugh."
488,gh2ilrx,Yeah she could lasso lighting somehow but the windy dream chamber was too much for the lasso of true disappointment
489,gh25gtw,"Competing and winning handily. Even if she was a kid at least have her be in the race by cheating repeatedly, not by kicking everyone's ass then running into a tree."
490,gh2l18b,"As a non-pilot, that part bothered me to the point I went to take a leak when they were taxiing for takeoff. He just starts fucking flipping switches like it’s a flight sim and poof, the plane turns on and boom, they’re in the sky. Not to mention it’s a fighter aircraft and they sit side-by-side. The movie plot holes are an abomination."
491,gh29fns,"Honestly I thought they were going to a scene of him trying to use a computer and being blown away. Instead they did a subway and an escalator. For a movie dedicated to the 80’s, they really strayed from what truly made the 80’s so timeless. The script really needed a bit more work."
492,gh2l19x,"They had subways in the US back in 1897 in Boston and New York in 1904. One of the stations is Boston literally had an escalator (made out of wood of all things, horrifically dangerous, they just replaced it a couple of years ago)."
493,gh2rk6o,I watched this last night with my mother and said the same thing to her. They were so absorbed in playing basketball in the street that they didn't see or hear tanks and humvees barreling down the goddamn road?
494,gh2rs0w,"A couple of the kids noticed and got off the road, looking right at the trucks.  Did they....not shout to the other kids, ""CAR!"" so they would move as well?

Kids should be required to see Wayne's World.  ""CAR!""  ""GAME ON!"" are vital parts of playing in the street."
495,gh2vo13,This can be said for the entire trip to Cairo. They accomplished nothing there.
496,gh3kd2q,I don't understand what that thing was.  She knocked over the camera then he got into a blue light and apparently everyone could still here them?
497,gh2vfa8,"...screaming, firing gatling guns, flipping & rolling, crashing into each other...

""Ooh, a ball!"""
498,gh34dix,"Remember, this was 1984. Innovative tech like yelling “car” hadn’t been developed yet."
499,gh3ktkg,The movie was filled with nonsense. I wouldn’t worry about it

0,dnzl4jp,"One of the aspect of this movie that I loved the most was how K went from normal to special and back again. 

The scene where the child is revealed to be a girl and K is absolutely crestfallen followed by K realizing that Joi was just a run of the mill AI programmed to say what you want to hear and the ad version of her even called him “Joe” also, which I believe shows that even that was just a part of her programming, really brought home the feeling that K was just a normal replicant with nothing special other than a shared memory or two instead of being born special or “the chosen one”. 

And only after that did he choose to save Deckard himself, revealing that he was special after all, but not because he was born that way, because he became special on his own."
1,dnz5o3o,Harrison Ford is 2 for 2 with playing regretful dads in sci-fi reboots. That last shot ripped my heart out.
2,do0h93d,"You already know that the ""baseline"" lines are from Nabokov's Pale Fire:

>Cells interlinked within cells interlinked

>Within one stem. And dreadfully distinct

>Against the dark, a tall white fountain played.

Here's what's interesting: 

Pale Fire is hard to describe if you haven't read it, but it consists of a long poem, ostensibly written by (fictitious) famous poet John Shade, followed by ""notes"" by an editor who proves to be more and more of an unreliable narrator. 

The baseline lines are part of Shade's description of what he saw when he had a near-death experience. Some time later, he reads in a newspaper an account from a woman who also had a near-death experience, and, in the poem, the paper quotes her as saying ""Beyond that orchard through a kind of smoke / I glimpsed **a tall white fountain**--and awoke.""

Shade sees this as too coincidental -- maybe this is some ur-memory, or proof of an afterlife! So he contacts the newspaper and gets in touch with the woman... who seems to have no memory of this. He checks back with the newspaper, and is told 

>""It's accurate. I have not changed her style.

>There's one misprint--not that it matters much:

>Mountain, not fountain. The majestic touch.""

So the ""tall white fountain"" was an identity-shaking, shared connection between two people... except it turned out not to be true after all.  **Kinda like K's memory about the horse and the furnace.**

edit: [The poem part of Pale Fire](http://www.shannonrchamberlain.com/palefirepoem.html). The baseline part is 705-707; the woman's quote is 757-758; the misprint quote is 800-802.

Go pick up a copy of Pale Fire! It's the best.

edit edit: To make it even more postmodern-delicious, note lines 781-783. The woman is eager to meet Shade because of her affinity for his poem about Mont Blanc (a tall white *mountain*). So who influenced whom?"

15,dnz9ay3,I'm glad Jared Leto finally let us a glimpse into his personal life.
16,dnz6b96,"I absolutely loved this movie. It might be one of my favorite sequels ever. 

Joi is an incredible character. I loved how they avoided going the easy route with her, and instead respected her for what she represented for K, as a companion and someone to give his life validation. The twist with her being simply a mirror for him to project his own delusions of grandeur into himself was masterful and heartbreaking. She quite literally just ""Said what he wanted to hear"". 

I also loved how the name ""Joe"" can imply many things. There's the Kafka connections, but with the main twist of him not being special, there's also the fact that he's quite literally an ""Average Joe"". All in all, this movie adapted the original novel better than the first movie. K's life being parallel to Roy's, right down to a ""tears in the rain"" ending was great. This might be Villaneuve's magnum opus."
17,dnza9kl,I really liked that Wallace was unable to duplicate Tyrell's work because he lacks vision.
18,dnzienb,"I think the moment when Joi was killed was a wonderful test for the audience. That scream of ""I love you"" as she was stamped out was a great test for the viewer on whether or not they see the AI as human, or as a creation distinct from even the androids. I was actually a little taken aback that I didn't react to it they way I would have expected to, I barely reacted at all. I was a little ashamed that I didn't see her as a living being because why shouldn't I? I found it fascinating after watching that that moment could be either a failure on the movie's part to humanize her, or a failure on my own for being incapable of empathizing with an AI, even one programmed to appease it's 'owner'. And that's an amazing thing for a film to do."

27,dnyxfyn,"I was absolutely blown away to be honest. I had high expectations, and they were exceeded. There were just so many individual elements I absolutely loved, but it still came together to be more than the sum of its parts. It was visually stunning. The score was intense and engaging. The characters were so memorable. Big spoilers ahead. The final fight scene in the waves and the ships was my favourite movie scene of the year so far, it was incredible to watch. The scene of him making love to Joi and the real girl at the same time was completely mesmerising.

My interpretation: I loved the ultimate message of the movie. K was just another replicant, sharing some of the same memories as so many other replicants. But the circumstances of his character, as a detective/officer, were such that he was the first replicant that ever ended up in the same setting as the memory of hiding the horse. He was the first replicant who had the opportunity to test whether the memory was legitimate, by trying to find the horse (which is also why the horse was still there). The ""miracle"" that K ""hasn't witnessed"" (as per the dialogue at the beginning where K retires the replicant in his home) is that a replicant can be born, with a soul. Once K sees this miracle (and believes that he may be the first one) he starts to run and disobey orders. But in the end, he was wrong, he wasn't born and the memory was implanted. But by that point, it didn't matter - just like K, we completely believed that since he was born, he was as human as human could get, and we sympathised with him totally. 

In the end, it didn't matter whether K was a plain old replicant or a ""born replicant"" (human?): the only thing separating K from having a soul, so to speak, was his and the audiences shared *belief* that he was naturally born. He broke the ""wall"" that was spoken about by Robin Wright's character at the beginning, without even knowing it.

The final frame was beautiful, I am so glad they ended it there, and I hope there's not a sequel. The world is so rich and even more developed after watching this that I feel like I spend hours imagining what might happen next, and I love that. I also love that we still don't know whether Deckard is a replicant or not.

I'll be thinking about it for days. Absolutely one of the best cinema experiences I've ever had. 

On another note: the CGI for Rachael was flawless, that would have to be the first time I've truly not noticed that a character was CGI despite knowing that it was.                    "

39,dnz4j6p,"Just got out. I’m not great at expressing myself with words, but I’ll try.

This film is something special and from the very first beats you could feel it would deliver the goods. I was in awe of every moment. Every frame a masterpiece. Villaneuve’s use of light and color in such an alien (yet familiar) landscape is awe inspiring. 

The sound design is probably the closest I’ve ever come to an auditory experience (outside of music) that gave me the feeling I was within a sculpture made with air. Sometimes you couldn’t tell if you were hearing an effect or a score. One of the aspects of the original film that I feel weighs it down is the score. I absolutely love Vangelis, but the sequel takes much better care with the themes than the original. 

The performances! Everyone comes across so natural, I never once questioned the reality presented. I was really worried about Leto, but he was one of my favorites. Robin Wright makes wonderful use of her time too. Gosling and Ford have a great chemistry. Mackenzie Davis, Ana de Armis... Jesus, so many fantastic characters. So many awesome surprises. 

Man. I haven’t been in love with a picture like this in a long time. Within seconds I was drawn in and kept there straight through. The only moments I stepped out were to try to observe how I was feeling. It’s really something special. I’ll be thinking of this film for a long time. 

Edit: The Las Vegas scenes took on a whole ‘nother level of eerie. What a strange, sad coincidence. "

49,do3kdq7,"I've seen Blade Runner 2049 twice now and there's definitely a lot to unpack. I haven't been able to get it out of my head. These are my thoughts. 

**SPOILERS**

To me, one of the most interesting themes explored in the film is the meaning of love. All the major characters view love differently and their perspectives are reflected by their actions.

* **For Ryan Gosling's character K, love means presence:** K's relationship with Joi is one of the most emotionally potent parts of the film. He simply wants the company. And he wants it to be available whenever he wants it. He can turn Joi on and off as he chooses and never asks anything of her besides her presence. He knows that after a period of her being turned off, he can turn her back on and she'll be there for him, unconditionally. It's that unconditional love that he's looking for, something humans often (though not always, unfortunately) get from their spouses and parents. He has Joi as a ""spouse"", and much of his arc in the film is devoted to his search for his ""parent."" This desire to feel special, to be loved, gives him purpose.

* **For Joi, love means giving someone what they want:** Joi's purpose is to indulge the desires of her companion. Her presence is meant to reinforce everything he wants to feel. She whispers into K's ears what he wants to believe. He wants to believe he's ""real,"" that he has a purpose beyond being a tool, and so she tells him that. He wants to feel normal and wants to express his love normally, so she calls over a tangible woman so that he can, uh, make love to her. She pushes him further into his fantasies, helping him truly believe he's more than just a replicant, that he was born and not manufactured, even if that's probably not something a replicant should believe. She doesn't necessarily give him what's best for him, only what he's looking for at any given time.

* **For Deckard, love means giving someone what they need:** Deckard plainly states that ""sometimes to love someone, you've got to be a stranger."" He doesn't allow himself to indulge his desire to see his child, because he knows that's not what's best for them. He has a pragmatic view of what love is, and he sets up a complex trail of misinformation and mystery to try and isolate his child's identity from the world, and to isolate himself. This is, of course, almost the polar opposite of K and Joi's ideal of love. Instead of trying to be there for his child at all times, he wants them isolated from him. It's his absence, and not his presence, that demonstrates his profound love for his child. (And, tragically, his child is literally isolated, all alone in a bubble.)

* **For Niander Wallace, love is a means to an end:** Wallace's concept of love is also pretty plainly presented. Love is more important to him than anything else even though he's drained it of its emotional foundation. I mean, he literally names his #1 replicant Luv. For him, Luv is a resource that does whatever he asks her to do. He also wants to manufacture love, both in the form of Joi and in the form of replicants that are capable of reproducing. He uses it as a weapon in the literal sense, with Luv acting as his enforcer. And he also uses it as a weapon in the metaphorical sense by showing Deckard a copy of the woman he loved to manipulate Deckard into revealing information about his child. Furthering this idea is the fact that he wants to find the child, the product of Deckard and Rachel's love, in order to dissect it and understand how he can create replicants capable of ""love"" that can create exponentially more children. For Wallace, love is the key to everything, which sounds romantic, but it's demystified. It is only a way for him to push forward his vision. (Haha, dude's physically blind AND blind to the meaning of love.)

I guess to summarize: Love is purpose and a way to dodge loneliness for K, it's indulgence for Joi, sacrifice for Deckard, and a commodity for Wallace.

I'm not sure I would go so far as to say that love is necessarily Blade Runner 2049's central theme, but it was the most interesting one to me because of how each character views it and how their views inform their actions in the film. It truly is a beautiful film and I think it's going to continue to stick in my mind.

What do you think about the themes of love in Blade Runner 2049?

50,dnz36it,"Carla Juri blew me away. Her two scenes were the absolute heart of this film. Her character was the warmest, kindest, most gentle soul imaginable and the perfect person to be the hope for the future. The final shot between her and Harrison Ford absolutely made the film for me, she was absolutely fantastic. "
51,dnz3mkz,"Going in as someone who considers the original one of the best movies of all time, I had high hopes. I was worried that it'd be too schlocky or that it would focus too much on action.

It met and exceeded all my expectations. Still a slow burn noir film like the original. Loved the tone, loved the amazing cinematography and loved the directing. I'll now watch anything Villeneuve directs. He's won my loyalty for life.

""He wasn't long for this world."" ""Something in his eyes."" Loved the tip of the hat to the Deckard Replicant theory.

The ""syncing"" scene with Joi and the prostitute was amazing.

Luv was a brutal baddie.

Interesting how Wallace got away. Very noir to have the powerful villain escape unscathed.

Gosling was awesome as K.

Harrison Ford owned every second of screen time.

The supporting characters were all great too.

Brilliant, brilliant movie."

My god, this is my top film of 2017. Such amazing casting, story, acting, and so much more. This is an all star cast with Ryan Gosling performance is amazing, you can feel every emotion that he is feeling despite playing a replicate whose usually emotion are limited and Ana de Armas performance is an emotional journey to sit through. Her death scene hit me in my soul

10/10, just wow."
64,dnzawxm,"Quick thoughts here. I'll have a better idea once I've had some time to process everything in the film.

I'm pretty sure it's my favorite of the year so far. Acting, direction, cinematography and music were all phenomenal. Harrison Ford actually looked like he gave a shit, and I'd argue this was the best performance he's ever given. Sylvia Hoeks was terrifying.

Poor doggo was left with millions of bottles of alcohol, but no Deckard :( Hopefully he came back for it later.

Also, I really couldn't tell whether they used CG or an actress or a mix to do Rachael, but damn, was I confused. 

Oh, and that love scene with the Joi and the prostitute is among the trippiest things I've seen on film, and it was beautiful. 

And I was mixed on Gaff's cameo. I was hoping for more, but I'm glad he was there.

Overall, I loved this film. It felt like a very organic extension of the original film, and I'm so happy that none of the questions people had after the first weren't answered here, but just alluded to. 

Villeneuve is now hands down my favorite director working in Hollywood today. He's done a great film every year since 2013.

Oh, and can we just appreciate how ballsy it was of Sony and Warner to do such a large-scale follow-up to a cult film, and have it pull no punches regarding story and visuals? This is easiest one of the riskiest blockbusters I've ever seen, and I sincerely hope it'll have been worth it for the studios."

Story-wise, be prepared, its a _true_ Blade Runner sequel so if you loved the first, you'll love the second, if you thought the first was too slowly paced, you'll probably think this one is too.

Great story, fucking great trailer to not give away half the shut they could have"
72,do0zqua,"I haven't seen anyone else mention it, but the opening scene of the film is an homage to the original shooting script of Blade Runner, where Deckard walks into s farm house, sits and watches a pot of boiling soup. A farmer enters, cleans himself up and asks who he is. He answers ""Deckard. Blade Runner"" and shoots the replicant before taking his jaw as a sign that he retired the replicant.

I gasped in the theater seeing the boiling pot and loved the hell out of this film.

If anyone wants to know what I'm talking about, watch the Blade Runner documentary called ""Dangerous Days"" it's great. "

"
76,dnz5qet,"Push Episode 9 to 2020 and give it to Villeneuve. 
"
77,dnzcwmv,"Didn't really expect a sci-fi sequel to Lars and the Real Girl.    

In all seriousness, I think Harrison Ford turned in a best supporting Oscar level performance here. The part of his scene with Wallace where he first sees Rachel is some of the best acting I've seen all year, I was utterly entranced.    

Also, the arc of K from just being a replicant cop, to very slowly opening up to the idea of being born (and possibly Deckard/Rachel's son), to his reaction to finding out the memory was real, to his heart being ripped out when he's told he's not the kid, just another replicant. Such a complete character arc (something Denis has said multiple times he loves doing, creating a loop). They made a damn sequel 35 years later to my 3rd favorite film of all time, and it does absolute justice in every way."
78,dnz30k8,I want a Joi.
79,do2eq3z,"Some of my favorite little moments in the film are when we get to see the enhanced physicality of K due to him being a replicant: 

-When he gets pushed through a wall, and then stabbed in the arm without even crying out in pain. 

-Whenever he uses his blaster, it's a rapid flurry of shots that all find their targets. Like he has aimbot or something. 

-When he got downed in the wasteland, even though he was injured, upon someone grabbing him he just lifts the attacker up and breaks his spine over his knee, Bane-style. 

-Him bursting through that wall Kool-Aid man-style. Deckard actually visibly jumped in that shot and it was both hilarious and intense as heck. "
80,dnzrojf,"So the most impactful element of the film really had nothing to do with Deckard, but with K and his loneliness.

He's a ""skinjob"" that neither his fellow replicants or humans like being around. The film shows how outside of his work in the LAPD, he is completely and utterly alone. Except for his personal Joi.

K and his relationship with Joi was too real for me to watch because it was a symptom of K's total social alienation. No one loves him except a glorified Siri.

For guys like me that go through stretches of time being alone, it's all too real when you replace actual human engagement with interaction with fictional characters (video games, literature, etc.)

K and his tragedy of finding a family (or destiny) and actually not succeeding was heartbreaking and I tried to hold back my tears when he sends Deckard away and allows himself to die alone"
81,dnz7tnb,"Absolutely adored this movie. One of the best cinema experiences I've ever had. I was enthralled within the first five minutes. Each shot, each frame, perfectly captured. Deakins' talent is at its best here. Couple the excellent cinematography with the amazing score, it was truly magnificent. I loved K's story, and I feel like it was realized and developed in such a natural and raw way. Stunningly gorgeous, unforgivably emotive, just an absolute joy to watch."
82,do0meou,"As there has already been plenty of in-depth discussion regarding the overall impression of the film, it's themes, the themes, the performances, etc., I wanted to take an opportunity to talk about a particular part of the plot that stuck with me after I left the theater that I don't see mentioned: the fact that Lieutenant Joshi was in love with K. There are several subtle (and sometimes not so subtle) instances that allude to this in the film. The first is when she says something along the likes of: ""you know sometimes I look at you and I just can't tell the difference."" For the life of me I can't remember his response, but I believe that the statement suggests that not only has she admired K on more than one occasion, but she said it in such a way as if she wanted to believe that he was something more than just a ""skin-job"" in an effort to justify the conflicting emotions bubbling up inside her. 

The second is a not so subtle example. The part where she visits K in his apartment seems pretty cut and dry at first. She comes in, she pours herself a drink, they chat about the case, but then she breaks. She looks over to the now nearly empty glass and says: ""what happens when I finish this?"" Which, to me basically meant: ""okay so now that we're done talking and I'm about to be done drinking all your alcohol, what is the next thing that naturally  happens between two people of the opposite sex, alone in an apartment."" I phrase it in this way because I believe she wanted to see what conclusion K, a replicant, would draw from that suggestion. K, seeming to miss the advance (or did he? hmmm), acts like nothing just happened and continued to go back to business as usual. The lieutenant, noticeably irritated, leaves in a huff. 

The third is when K fails his baseline test. I can see how this can be misconstrued fairly easily. She's his boss, he's just a replicant, and she is pissed that he would dare defy her. However, she wasn't just pissed, she was furious. But her fury was fueled not by the disobedience, but by the inevitable fact that since K had failed that test, she knows that he will now have to be ""retired."" Why does she give him 48 hours to try again? After all he is just a replicant, another less traumatized replicant could easily be created and fill K's shoes. But no. In the face of the inevitable, she chose to prolong the process out of fear of losing HIM.

Last but not least, the confrontation with Luv. Luv enters. Lieutenant Joshi is on her computers (possibly tracking K) but she quickly shuts off the monitors at her entrance. Then, in the face of certain death, she continues to keep K's whereabouts hidden for as long as she possibly can. 

Some of the main themes in blade runner is humanity's attempt to manipulate nature and the exploration of what it means to be human. This film expanded not only on the universe in which Blade Runner exists, but it expands on the evolving complexities that have begun to surface as ""skin jobs"" and humans begin cohabitation in society. For those who believe that Deckard is not a replicant, this has already been done to an extensive degree with Rachel and the enlightening revelation that replicants can indeed procreate. For those who still believe that Deckard is a replicant, Lieutenant Joshi and K's relationship could serve as another  example of that evolving complexity. "
83,do10xuc,"Back from my second viewing, one thing that really hit close to home this time was the journey of K dreaming of being Rachael and Deckards son, but that hope being completely extinguished. I've rarely truly felt a characters disappointment so clearly before.

He's really only in the last 30 minutes or so, and I think it would have been an amazing surprise (even though I'm sure almost everyone would have expected it) to have his voice come on when they're in the hotel, and then he walks out of the shadows with the gun.

Apart from the obvious fantastic performances from Ryan and Harrison i'd also like to highlight Robin Wrights performance, she's really great. The most powerful part for me was when K lost it during the memory recollection sequence, incredible. "
93,do136jm,"It's going to drive me nuts trying to rationalize how much of Joi's relationship with K was a genuine connection and how much of it was simply her programming obliging her to love her owner. It's obvious that they both don't feel fully human, and they do bond over that, but so much of that seems to be proven wrong when he sees the Joi advertisement that refers to him by the ""human"" name that his copy gave him.

That was by far my favorite emotional arc of the film, and I think it was handled way better than in the movie *Her*."

Yeah I loved the movie and my expectations were insanely high but it exceeded them somehow. Also it was an emotional gut punch of a film, I was holding back tears on at least three different occasions. My only complaint was some aspects of Zimmer's score, but the Mesa track along with the visuals gave me goosebumps.

Can't fault any of the performances, Gosling as K was the perfect casting choice and I thought Luv and Joi were among the standouts. "

The movie was visually **stunning**. It's an absolute masterpiece of cinematography. It was *so* beautiful. There were many scenes where I just gasped at how beautiful or at the sheer scale of things. They really did an amazing job of showing the sheer scale of the world, I really loved that. 

The music was incredible. I absolutely love the style of music and it was very true to the original Vangelis Score. 

Also the story in general was very very very well done. It was so refreshing to see a story that was challenging, that made you think and feel. Leaving the theater i had to just sit for a minute in my car and process what I had seen. 

Overall I would **highly** recommend people see this in theaters if they are able. Especially if you liked the first one. 

I personally loved this movie 10/10 I will probably buy it and the soundtrack."

103,dnyxsn4,"Saw it last night. Unlike the original, which took me a few viewings to appreciate, I loved 2049 straight away. I feel like this one explores similar themes regarding sentience, humanity and mortality but more from the perspective of ""artificial"" life, rather than that of a human. Funnily enough, I thought this was in some ways more human than the original Blade Runner.

Ryan Gosling portrayed the emotional yearning of K with immense subtlety; beneath his cold demeanour you could see his inner ""humanity"" wanting to break free. Harrison Ford didn't seem like he was phoning it in at all, and I was genuinely moved by his scenes as I thought he carried the weight of his character brilliantly. The plot wasn't anything particularly special, especially the role of Jared Leto's Niander Wallace, but I wasn't too bothered as this is more of a vessel to explore the central ideas and establish the mood and atmosphere of the film - which, I might add, was SPECTACULAR. Not once did I question anything I saw on screen as being anything less than 100% real, and my immersion was held throughout.

All in all, I think this is easily one of the best sci-fi films of recent memory. I love that it still retains much of the ambiguity of the original."
104,do0v4oq,Seemed like TARS was doing the bassline test. 
105,dnz163r,"It's baffling how Leto's Niander Wallace had only three scenes in the film. One with his entrance, the next with the Replicant 'birthing', and the final being the scene with Deckard. All amounted to (give or take) 10 minutes.

... and then he just disappears without any sense of closure or finality."
106,dnz3lhj,"This movie is pretty much in a league of its own. Also stands on its own as a legitamatwly great sci-fi movie. Villeneuve talked about taking sci-fi seriously, and it shines in this film. It's a horrific, polluted, desolate cyberpunk world, and the characters occupy it.

The world is cold and heartless, and there's something profound about K's journey being nothing more than a small story set against the backdrop of the Blade Runner world.

Joi was a surprisingly effective way to introduce heart and relatability into the movie, even if she's an artificial lifeform, and the reminder of her non-human nature spoke volumes about the deeper themes throughout the film. It takes the moral conflict from the first movie and expands upon it in a way that never felt preachy or overblown.

Even Sapper Morton, the most swole scientist in history, is able to tell his story in his short five minutes on screen.

Overall, a great movie that does a lot with its small story, gives a career best performance from Gosling, and overall makes me feel bad for wanting us to pollute the earth until we live in a cyberpunk future.

Probably one of the best movies of 2017."
107,do2dmji,"Apologies if someone else has already brought this up, but I think I found one more hint to Deckard's humanity hidden in the film.  When the credits start rolling in that smoldering orange nixie tube font, some of the names have a sort of splitting/re-assembling animation, and some of the names just appear whole and don't move.  After a few went by I started to notice that the names of all the actors playing human characters appeared solid, while several replicant names were jittering around.  Harrison Ford's name?  Complete and unmoving."
108,dnz1ows,"Man. That final fight along the reservoir between Luv** and Joe was fucking intense. Seeing Gosling choke her out like that was pretty hardcore.

113,do2mgd9,"A note on Joi’s sentience: a lot of people are saying that she was not sentient and her love for Joe/K is not genuine because her function is for her owner to “see what you want to see, hear what you want to hear”.


Now, I think because this is the Blade Runner franchise, we are used to “sentience = rebellion against one’s creators or owners, and one’s function”. However, another popular manifestation of artificial sentience in sci-fi is “sentience = extremely deep understanding of one’s function and finding creative ways of fulfilling it beyond what is imagined by the creators”. This is frequently seen in Issac Asimov stories.


Personally, I think Joi’s actions throughout the film was about more than just fulfilling Joe’s desires, but about fulfilling her own as well. But let’s say she’s all about Joe’s desires: even then she was way beyond fulfilling Joe’s whims, base desires or even emotional needs - she made it her task to fulfil his *spiritual* needs. For that, she would need to understand his spiritual needs in the first place, and if she was capable of such a level of understanding, how can she be anything less than sentient? Furthermore, she “fulfilled” these needs of his not by doing things for him, but by encouraging him to take actions and embark on a journey, which showed an understanding that these were not things that she could do for him - no one could help him reach individuation except himself. To have such an understanding of agency, how can she be any less than an individual herself? And finally, to have cared for Joe on such a level and to such an extent, how could her feeling for him be anything less than true love? Like the robots in Asimov stories who became great philosophers and humanitarians, because their 3 (or 4) laws were designed with human morality in mind, Joi, too became a true lover and companion because her function was designed with love and companionship in mind.


TL;DR: even if Joi never acted explicitly against her programming, that by no means rules out her being sentient."
114,dnzazl0,That sync between Joi and the prostitute was straight outta *Her*
115,dnzcftk,"Wow, what a movie. I just walked out, and didn't want to look at my phone or anyone for a while. I just wanted to walk, feel the night under glow of the Mid-Autumn moon. The sort of movie that makes you feel alive in a stark, visceral way. 

Spoilers.

So, the film it most reminded of wasn't the original Blade Runner oddly. It was Children of Men, and that trend of sci-fi I consider Bleak Romanticism. Other sci-fi you see on occasion shows the same trend (Interstellar comes to mind) where the film presents a hard, ugly world with ugly people making ugly choices, with some soft core of romance under the layers of grime driving the main characters forward.

Everything in the film outside the world if imagination in the memory locker and the final scene of the film is bleak. That white washed out nightmare of maggot protein farms in the future Central Valley of California. The streets of Los Angeles, where is always night and under a current of black rain or darker ash. The atomic orange haze of a burnt out Vegas. What remains of San Diego, a literal scrap heap crawling with human vultures. 

This is an ugly world, yet beauty is found in the contours. A dead white tree, yellow flowers at the base for the memory of lost love. A small wooden horse carved with a fathers care. Shapes and silhouettes  forming, syncing in the dark. And that wonderful work of imagination and memory, where the only lush green in the entire universe is seen. 

Humans created the ugliness, but they also contain the beauty within. And it takes K, a poor, lost, hopeless, confused, so very human Blade Runner and replicant so uncover it all. 

Like all of us, K thinks he's special. He hopes for it, but that hope has been burrowed deep inside of him. It's too precious for the bleak, ugly world he lives in. He shares with Joi, his memories, his hopes of being more than just a skinjob, of mattering. And then one day his greatest fear and greatest wish come true.

Maybe he *is* important, maybe his life is one of those rare in a million in a billion that matters in this huge, cruel world. The clues add up, and with his skills as a detective he realizes he might be the chosen one, the link between humans and replicants, someone born of a mother, not a machine, someone with a soul. And Joi is there to re-enforce him at every step. Yes, he does matter. Yes, he is special. Yes, she'll do whatever it takes to help him, even risking final death for her. 

Then it's all taken away - the man he believes is his father, Joi, and, eventually, his destiny when he learns he's not the chosen one after all. He's just another replicant, gifted with the memories of the actual special one, a sweet girl with an imagination to transform this world that he already met. And everything just caves in.

The Tears in the Rain scene is just astounding, and took a while for the meaning to fully sink in to me. There he is, the classic noir hero, with a broken patched up nose, blood everywhere, in the dark rainy night of his city, and he sees Joi's larger than life advertisement, and realizes it was all self reinforced. She was programmed to say what he wanted to hear, to do what he wanted her to do. And it hits home, all at once, his empty love for her, which was really for himself, a lost boy, the ultimate circle jerk, and makes that all important realization that if he doesn't matter, all that matters is what he does. 

Which leads to that beautiful final scene in the snow. It's the only time the real world is ever allowed such beauty in this film, and like the end of Children of Men a stoic, dying complicated man watches the hope for the new world head off without him, finding peace in the only place any of us ever get it, within ourselves, accepting this world and the great beyond it. 

Just an amazing film. Villeneuve knocked it out of the park. "
116,dnznw1r,"Exactly. It was much more powerful because K wasn't some ""chosen one"", he was just another replicant who made the decision to do something special, which showed they can be just as ""human"" as humans, if not more."
117,do1vp5j,"Joi became special on her own too, everyone focuses on her naming him but her agency went far beyond that. From small details like her goofing off in the background while Joe is doing something else to her insistence to being placed into the portable device and through that becoming “real” in some sense.


I thought that tied in with the imagery of the fake and real snow: the fake snowflakes can de replicated ad infinitum but the real snowflakes were unique and melt away after a brief existence, similar to how Joi the commercial program was everywhere but Joe’s Joi was unique and gone forever."
118,do2w7vg,"I got a different impression from the Joi thing - because we're shown Joi having as much agency as she possibly can with what she has (hiring the woman to make her ""real"" to which the woman says ""You've got a real special lady here"", to demanding to go with K.)

The the way she desperately begged for her ""life"" and her last words were to tell K she loved him -- it was definitely a continued discussion of the philosophical line of what makes someone real. If it's love, or memories, or the ability to create life. Maybe it's none of those at all.

Tl;dr STILL SHOOK."

120,dnzmkwo,"It was my favorite part too... 9/10 movies would have embraced the ""chosen one"" BS and this could have been boring and terrible. Thankfully they went the right way with this. "
121,do3g4iw,"Joi might pick the name 'Joe' because of something deep in her programming, but why does that matter? She's obviously more than a commercial application - she has K (Joe) break a Wallace product in order to help him both break the law and limit the ability of the Wallace corporation to do anything about it. She is absolutely a program but also absolutely a lot more than a chat bot. The ambiguity of her emergent behavior asks exactly the same question Blade Runner has been asking since the beginning - what does it mean to be human, how can you 'prove' you're more than an automaton?"
122,dnzatn1,He plays a regretful dad in the incredible sci-fi reboot Kingdom of the Crystal Skull too!!!

125,dnzibtk,"Denis knows how to end movies.

"
126,do16ibv,"This is my very first post. And you have nailed something to me that changes my interpretation of this film...er, enhances it beyond expectations. Something... about our misinterpretation of what our purposes in life are...misplaced identity and fate and the self-based heartache when we find out how unremarkable we are ((in self)... (simulation, AI, reality, relativity)) Yet, despite that, K decides to do something so selfless, so human, to benefit Deckard and his daughter; his sacrifice and expulsion of self for others is beautiful and inspiring. To me, this truly exhibits what a film is supposed to do...change us for the better, or at least inspire us to make a change for the better. A blunt phrase can do only so much, but when a bit of effort is made to decipher the message, it pins that message to the heart so much more. I cannot wait to see this film again. I can't explain now, but to me, this trumps BR2019(82) . And now also requires another ST2:TWoK viewing. Thank you so much for this post! Someone give DoctorFork some gold! "

Dude. Of all the amazing comments this thread, this just blew my fucking mind.

"
139,do1y6y2,"Also liked how it compared the 2 times he feels the snow on his hand. 

The first is when he thinks he was the child, and he is feeling the snow as a 'real' person. 

Then he feels it again after he finds out he's not the child, and it feels just as real. I don't think being born made the replicants any more or less human, just the next evolutionary step. "
140,do0vn8t,"Your comment made me think of this scene's connection to Joi's (and Roy's in the original, now that I think if it) first time in the rain, watching the rain interact with and in a sense outline her ""realness."" Beautiful thematic symmetry, about how we shape our world as it is shaped by us, and in that tension we find reality. "
141,do28zj8,Another reason the scene is so awesome is that they react the same way to the snow cementing the idea that they are essentially the same person since they share the same childhood memories.
142,dnz3h2e,"That might have been a gigantic throwaway moment in any other film comma but I actually believe that is one of the biggest giveaways that Deckard may actually be human.

But then again, I don't know how future cars are built. So I guess I could head-cannon that the body was carbon-fiber and all insides were packed with electronics. Maybe the electronics were made of self-healing materials and that's why it worked after getting its shit fried. 

The concept of the kite harpoon was definitely cool looking though."

167,dnz7gjd,"I enjoyed Joi's character much more after I realized how exactly she worked. It didn't feel like gimmciky sci-fi technology like you would see in movies like this. Her presence tells you a lot about K, and how badly he wants to be human, to the point that he shakes when he thinks about that memory. Makes you feel a lot more sympathetic to him after the reveal"
168,dnz81iq,"> but with the main twist of him not being special

I didn't get that at all. He wasn't the kid but he was special. He became human at the end because there's nothing more human than dying for a righteous cause. There are so many ways to dissect this movie though,  this shit is a gift. "
169,do0be3r,Tyrell certainly lacked vision at the end of the first one too. 
170,dnzdxp9,He blind lol
171,do1uqzr,"Well also the clear difference between him and Deckard/Rachel’s daughter.   
  
They are both “Creators” but while Wallace has been focused on “artificially” and removing “emotions”, she while creating fake memories did it from a place to provide real feeling/emotions. She put enough detail into K that he thought it was so real while Wallace couldn’t even get Rachel’s eyes right."
172,do2amcy,"I think there were many moments to humanize her. Her excitement for the emanating device, the scene in the rain, her goofing around and most importantly making her presence known with a sound when the hooker was hitting on him. She also kicked her out later after she was done with her. While I felt she was real and became personal to K, her ad was the same as Ford seeing another Rachel. They may be the same but not really.

I didn't feel much for her death because they set it up when she said just like a real girl."
173,dnzjlg8,"But then the scene where you see her giant hologram makes you feel better and smarter as a viewer for not relating, but feel worse for K for actually caring.  

"
174,dnz2edd,The scene where she was trying to sync with Mariette was damn good.The changes between the two faces was so subtle.
175,dnz0qkt,Really dug those subtle lighting effects where depending on where Joi was standing parts of her would be transparent. Best movie hologram to date.
176,dnzxepm,what was really subtly heartbreaking for me was when k and joi crashed and joi started glitching. she was standing outside the flying car calling desperately for k. that visual of her and the look of true helpless panic was really well done.
177,dnzdkim,"Then I loved the casual responses at the end, the cheery ""ok we're done"" (or whatever it was) the first time and then a pissed off ""not even CLOSE to baseline"" afterwards"
178,dnz829j,"Oh my god, we saw this in the Dolby theater at AMC and the first time they showed the baseline scene the sound was absolutely INSANE. Made me really uncomfortable and mesmerized at the same time."
179,do0r9eo,"The poem K recites for his Baseline is from the novel Pale Fire by Vladimir Nabokov, the same book that he has in his apartment. 

EDIT: here’s the full text he recites

And blood-black nothingness began to spin
A system of cells interlinked within
Cells interlinked within cells interlinked
Within one stem. And dreadfully distinct
Against the dark, a tall white fountain played."
180,dnz886c,"It felt iconic for me. Just very specific, intense and intruiging."
181,do0tze2,"I didnt understand the test.. was he just supposed to answer with the last word/words said, ignoring the messages in between while showing no emotional response?

Makes me feel a tad stupid "
182,dnz92xk,"I wouldn't call them wacky to me there were intensely unnerving. When that one interrupted the last time he took the baseline test and it was like ""White pillar"" . 

I think it was just a really interesting way of bringing all of that up front. The real terrible implication of Deccard was a replicant is that this is something that has to be checked and monitored in a *person*. "
183,dnz6bnu,The final scene between him and Anna is quite possibly some of the best acting that I've ever seen from him. The look on his face when he realises what he's looking at after all those years just blew me away and left me emotionally fucking traumatised . it was absolutely indescribably beautiful. 
184,dnzaamh,"I loved the scene of Deckhard chasing K and how it strongly resembled that of Deckhard being chased by Roy in the original film.

 Deckhard was the dumb one in both scenes. "
185,do1c2pi,I think he elevated the original. Unheard of.
186,dnzaywz,Great catch
187,dnze5gz,Oh wow I was wondering what the bee scene was about. Great catch. 
188,do1kvqd,"Well, not sure about that. Director specified that there are no flowers, so therefore those bees have their feeders near hives: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7yA-yVruX4

So nice thought nonetheless, bust most likely wrong"
189,do29hv0,"Here's another great Rachel clue. The name ""Rachel"" (from the Bible) means ""ewe"". That's why Olmos placed an origami sheep before K when they'd met."
190,dnzrdw3,"I mean, the product placement is supposed to be there, isn't it? The world of 2047 is one that is simply way more commercialised than what we already have."
191,do12odk,Yeah Pan Am totally paid for that placement. 
192,do0x7wz,The Atari logo cracked me up. Nice throwback to the original.

197,do0z0qd,All I could think of is how fucked I'd be if I had to take that test every day.
198,dnz67nd,"One of the best bits of dialogue was about the dog. 

“Is he real?” — “I don’t know, why don’t you ask him?”

It was just one of those things that was dead on accurate. It mirrored the question that everyone in the audience must have been thinking, the response was funny and in character, and it also symbolically pointed to the main theme of the film. 

Edit: As some people have pointed out, I misquoted the dialogue. It goes: “Is it real?” — “I don’t know. Ask him.”

(Ford enunciates the line sort of like this: “*I* don’t know. Ask *him*.”)"
199,dnyyii8,"> But in the end, he was wrong, he wasn't born and the memory was implanted. But by that point, it didn't matter 

I've been having a hard time coming up with what the movie is trying to say, and I think this captures it perfectly. Both stories (The original and this) are about an individual's story about regaining their humanity or ""soul"". And I love that this movie doesn't beat us over the head with its message. I just want to say, great job Hampton Fancher and the screenwriters involved! "
200,dnyzvdo,"One thing I'm not sure on, was Deckards daughter the only one that makes the memories? If so, and K's memory was real, is it implied that the little boy hiding the wooden horse was actually her, and she implanted her real memory into K?"
201,dnz9f8t,What do we think her deal is by the way? It sorta seemed like she was in the know about what Gosling was really up to. Especially based on their earlier conversations. 
202,dnzan8k,"She's come a far way from yelling ""Run Forrest run!"""
203,dnzpdgk,"Yeah my life is pretty shitty at the moment, it was a good way to escape for 3 hours but now here I am. "
204,do09503,"Blade Runner always made me feel that way, so I was strangely relieved that 2049 managed to do the same thing."
205,dnz3hno,"The whole dynamic between K and Joi was very well done. When they first introduced Joi I thought it was super creepy and weird, but as the movie went on I really liked their relationship. "
206,dnzckdz,"The movie plays out a brilliant world setting.

LA is dark, wet, polluted and gritty. The landscape of the world (with a wall to keep the ocean out) is dystopian as fuck, and you get the feeling that humanity is on the backslide. Apartments are crammed up together and everything is dirty and kept only barely functional.

Meanwhile, the movie also sets out an incredible power dynamic between the police and the corporate world (both of which are omnipresent and are only challenged by one another. The police are oppressive and intimidating in their imposing structure. At one scene in the movie, there's a shot of blood being cleaned off a wall of the inside of the LAPD. It's obvious that, in the complete absence of any social welfare like education or decent opportunities for the population, the authorities are the ones who pick up the slack.

Yet we see Luv just walking around the LAPD station on two occasions, and in both instances she straight up murders a police officer. Corporate power is at such a point that it can basically strongarm itself into institutions of order and authority to maintain its might, and nothing will change that. Even at the end of the film, Wallace's power remains unassailable. 

It really makes me want to know more about the world in which Blade Runner is set. There's nothing mentioned (at least in 2049, I haven't seen the original in over a decade) about the political hierarchy above the police. There's no US flags anywhere in LA (which, to an Australian, seems weird since Americans show off their flag a lot). What's the media like? Is there an informed citizenry? Does everyone who isn't super rich live in a derelict apartment, or is there a middle class with access to a decent middle ground between the extremes, while still suffering the same consequences of overpopulation? Just thinking about it, we actually don't get very good of an idea as to much beyond the dynamic of unchecked corporate might and mass consumerism on a horrific scale."
207,dnz9d3c,"A lot of Phillip K. Dick's worlds are like that really, he tended to enjoy gritty, grimy sci-fi settings as the basis of his stories."
208,dnzbekr,"I loved that.

I kept worrying that every time K would get into a pickle, Deckard was gonna be the one who showed up to save him by shooting the bad guy and the camera pans over to see him there holding a gun. 

Thank god this movie is better than the trailer implied."
209,dnyy9ss,One of the first aerial shots of the fields that turn out to be an endless sea of hangers and factories was amazing. As too was the brief shadow of what looked like a colony transport that they must have been subsequently traveling to for the climax. 
210,dnyyc7s,It also sounds great! Has that Dunkirk vibe to it which makes sense because of Zimmer and Wallfisch. And when that classic Blade Runner pistol fired or when there's a spinner flying by... oh man... Just great sound design all over. 
211,dnz7b0r,"And still let's him go on to do something unique and remarkable without being the ""neo"" of blade runner universe. So good. "
212,dnz1w0f,"As a wwe fan, I love how far Bautista has come in such a short time outside of wrestling. He may have been in it for a short time but I think he was used perfectly for his role. "
213,dnz71tf,A figurative stab in the ribs before an actual stab. The realization that his Joi had no agency was the final push K needed to give his life for the cause. Beautiful movie.
214,dnyyqub,Real human bean.
215,dnz639m,"Man i was just thinking about how far he's come. What an honor it must be for him to star in a sequel to a movie that  probably inspired his generation, and then have that sequel be just as good as the first. 

Made me feel like a proud mama gosling."
216,dnz68da,"That fucking score. 

Anyone shitting on Zimmer because it's apparently the cool thing to do is seriously delusional. I was absolutely stunned by the scene. "
217,dnzp0hw,"He got the role in Guardians and didn't wanna screw it up so he hired an acting coach and increased his range for the first movie. Since then I think he's continued refining his acting skills and because of that dedication he's going to continue getting meatier roles.

Perhaps one day we will have Best Supporting Actor: Dave Bautista.

The Rock is a bigger movie star, but Bautista is the better actor. A few years ago I would have said Rock were both those things."
218,dnz7rxg,I really wanted more of him
219,dnzdq52,"""Great parking and location, but popcorn is far too buttery. Had seizure here. 2/5 wouldn't recommend."""
220,do065f7,That scene in the casino was so intense I'm surprised I didn't get a seizure.
221,dnzd485,Funny that they chose this car brand for the film. Maybe none of the others wanted to risk a second Blade Runner curse!
222,dnz1t1w,Yeah it really flew by for me. I'd heard people talking about it being very slow-paced and potentially boring but I was riveted and genuinely disappointed when I realised it was nearing the conclusion. I could soak up those visuals forever. 
223,dnz851k,"At first I thought it was odd that a person could experience such joy in such a joyless situation. Being locked up due to a ""compromised immune system,"" working on creating various memories for replicants (many of which will be happy memories), it all seemed very grim to me at first. But when you finally realize who she is and what she is meant to be, it all makes sense in the most gorgeous of ways. Her impenetrable kindness indicates hope for future replicants, and possibly society. What a beautiful film."
224,dnz9ge2,I would also add that I loved his dog and I’m glad he survived. That stupid scotch drinking puppet!
225,dnzgtgf,"This film felt more like a side story. Wallace is a Greater Scope Villain, the racial tensions between Replicants and humans are there, but not quite boiling over. 

Joe believes he is the Chosen One, only to realize he is actually a decoy, and ultimately merely a 'herald' to the coming change and uprising. He dies having stamped his mark in a very small way, having asserted his humanity - he isn't really the new Deckard here. He's Roy Batty.

The story is much more personal too, and the consequences are lower - the fate of the world isn't directly at stake here, and ultimately Joe didn't sacrifice himself for the cause as much as he did to reunite Deckard with his daughter.

Incredibly refreshing. Great film."
226,dnz55j2,The scene was needed.Imagine if someone told you that you were a robot and that all your memories were false and they explained it convincingly.At this point you have doubts and maybe you start believing in it.Wouldn't you want to check it?
227,dnzc2k2,"That was such a well crafted red herring. 

""Why does this scene exist? Oh it's the end of the daisy chain where he consults an expert to confirm the thing he already knew when he say the date on the stump.""

""Oh man this chicks story is neat and compact and we'll told""

""Interesting. Its confirmed but also it's such a different story from what she's used to she's welling up with emotions. Damn this is a great scene""

""Yep gosling was a great choice to pick for this role""

...

Oh fuck you that's not fair. Your not allowed to fuck with me like that. I wasn't paying attention I was to busy being sad for the girl in the bubble!"
228,dnz012n,That was seriously phenomenal. And when she shot her...Jesus Christ. 
229,dnz1qvr,"It was weird, like it wasn’t 100% as her eyes felt wrong (not regarding the eye color). But at the same time you can rationalise it by saying that’s probably what Deckard felt too as she looked like an imitation that was 99% there but not the same as the real thing. "
230,dnyyuf7,They had lighting that could hide the limitations. It was pretty much seemlessly done.  
231,dnz664t,having sex with two women superimposed on each other is my new fetish. 
232,dnz16e8,"Of all the striking images in the film, the one of Joi's and Marriette's hands stroking the back of Ryan Gosling's head is the shot that has stuck with me the most. Got some serious Her vibes from that scene as well."
233,dnz7nc7,I could not believe what I was watching. It looked so real
234,dnzilbs,"The greatest part of that scene is you get to see how much joi actually loves K, And it has a lot to do with the way mariette and joi undressed. You can clearly see how mariette has the mindset( well this is just something I need to be done, and I want to do it as fast as possible) as she's hastily taking off her cloths.
While joi slowly removes her dress wanting k to look closer at every part of her.
It's beautiful commentary on love."
235,dnz3e1n,"The entire time I am saying to myself, ""God, this movie is gorgeous."" The production design and lighting inside the BadCorp (??) HQ was astonishing."

240,dnzm6cc,Can't believe I didn't know anything about her until a year ago and now I'm in love with her. She is mesmerizing.
241,do00ouu,I saw her in the trailer and shamefully thought she was gonna just be goslings ditsy damsel in distress to save. So happy to be wrong.
242,dnz3rek,"and after all these years they still only send one officer to subdue a strong replicant instead of, you know, a horde of machine gun army.."
243,do0e8qg,"I think it was there to show which decision K made. The replicants told him itd be more human to go with the resistance and i think they said kill deckard? And he decided instead to save deckard and bring him to his daughter which he thought was more human. IMO

Edit: Also, i think it showed that K didn't want to be taking orders anymore and truly did what he wanted. "

247,dnzf5kj,"It was about on the same level as RO, but they were smart with how they used it.  She only had about 3 full-face shots and she didn't emote much.  Whenever her mouth moved it was still really messy, they can never get the lips quite right."

256,dnzs3vy,Right. I wonder if he realizes how much his loneliness and insecurity actually makes him pretty human after all.
257,dnzs3xp,I love that the bulk of the film is dedicated to K and his life as a replicant. I know a lot of people who complain about the “Deckard is replicant” theory arguing that if he is s replicant then why should we care what happens to him? This movie shows that you absolutely can care about a replicant as a main character. 
258,dnza2jt,I agree even though it would totally fuck up their marketing
259,dnz2scv,"Joe and Joi what a couple.

263,dnzh9im,"Anyone else catch the references to ""a wolf in sheep's clothing"", K is a replicant killing other replicants, that sheep origami figure, his ringtone was Peter and the Wolf, he literally wears a sheepskin coat. Maybe I'm looking too deeply into it lol."
264,dnz4q88,"I feel like that goes with the territory. Blade Runner just sort of has that dreamlike quality to it where the characters come and go as needed.

And honestly what were Joe and Deckard going to do? Storm his office? This isn't that sort of movie. Blade Runner isn't a world where the good guys beat the bad guys and save the future, it's a story about the characters and their triumphs. Wallace lives because his death wouldn't mean anything to the story.  "
265,dnz7fip,"I loved that. Same for the resistance. It wasn't about them. That's the decision K made at the end, to reject either side's agenda and do the human thing for Deckard and his daughter."
266,dnz67vs,"Just a tiny correction, it wasn't a reservoir, it was a sea wall keeping the Pacific ocean from flooding Los Angeles. I thought the part were K and Joi fly over it had the best music in the film."
267,do20vil,"I liked how this was shown in the two scenes when he felt the snow on his hands. 

Once when he was 'special', and then he seemed to feel the same once he was 'normal'. Showed that being special didn't make him any more or less alive. "
268,do2r2hf,"She also made a lot of decisions on her own. I think it's pretty interesting because even replicants seemed to have disdain for the virtual ""Jois"" despite having some pretty similar programming."
269,do84p75,"I just remembered that scene when K tried to stop Joi from going with him. When K  pointed out that she could be destroyed forever, Joi's response was simply: ""like a real girl?"" "

273,dnzzurv,I'm not sure what movie you're referencing. Nothing by that name comes up in my memory.
274,do388ez,"This is what I took away from it as well.
He realizes that he is no one important at all. He brings nothing revolutionary to the table. However, he take the comments of the woman who informed him that the child was a girl, and the comments by Bautista about miracles and realized that humanity is subjective. Sacrifice for merits of which you feel can make a difference are as important as sacrifice for causes that help others, if you can do both; even better. 

The largest takeaway for me was his realization that being special wasn’t important, choosing what to do with his life was important. 

For me, it was the master stroke of the film; making you reevaluate what a hero of a film, or a life, really is."
275,do0bmcb,And saving Deckard in the process. 
276,do12hnq,There it is.  That's what Bladerunner is.

280,do136zl,"And echoing back to when joi was out in the rain watching the drops of water go through her hand. Beautiful stuff.

I really think they did an amazing job paying homage to the original, and building on its themes, while still standing on its own. This is by far the most successful sequel to a movie that nobody should normally ever attempt to make a sequel for. "
281,dnz3v6l,I am so fucking happy they left that ambiguous. I was worried going in that they were just gonna say Deckard is a replicants but they didn't.

I initially assumed it was typical 'need to make protagonist obvious' syndrome but that's quite a clever way to highlight the gender difference early on.

297,dnzptd3,I just find it interesting that both K and Joi are both synthetic humans or approximations of one yet one is valued higher than the other.
298,dnzr6cv,She was so sweet. That scene when she cries when she looks at K's memories put a lump in my throat.
299,dnzin3x,I think it's almost ok though. This movie was made out of sheer love. The original Blade Runner under sold too and at the time audiences were Luke warm on it. I think this will be the same but it will be held up with the original for years to come.

308,dnzmxr5,I think he meant metaphorically but it works in the literal sense as well
309,do2xpj4,"I took it the exact opposite way. Parallel to replicants being made not born, they're still sentient. AI, while mass produced, has the same emergent consciousnesses. I think the message is actually that if you believe you feel, that's more important than others saying you cannot feel. K is not supposed to have a soul, exactly like how the AI is not supposed to have a soul. This movie basically kept the philosophy fresh by introducing another layer of ambiguity over the first film. We kind of all agreed by the end of the first that replicants are basically people, so how do you build on that? I think it's perfectly defensible to say Joi loved him."
310,dnzmskl,I was heartbroken twice cause of that... Her death by being stepped on and k seeing the hologram as he realizes she wasn't real and would say whatever she wanted to hear.

The Baseline test is similar but ironically, the purpose has been flipped.  The tester *knows* K's a replicant.  They're studying his reactions to make sure he isn't *too* human.  "
319,do0xan9,"Yeah, you pretty much got it. He failed the last time because he was starting to *think* about the questions, but he shouldn't think (feel) anything at all."
320,dnz8wlo,"Yep this scene right here is right up there with the Seawall scene, K's death, and synced sex with Joi and prostitute replicant were the major highlights for me."
321,do1hdm8,Possibly the best way to distinguish the fact that Deckard may be human. He was out smarted by both K and Roy and inferior physically to both. 
322,do0hobo,I thought for sure Deckard would quote Roy Batty at some point. I was desperate for it but I'm glad they didn't because that would be pointless fan service for idiots like me

324,do1z28g,"I'm pretty sure this couldn't have happened and yet it's highly upvoted. Rachel died 28 years prior and he already left by that point. He wouldn't have known where she was buried let alone risk him or other replicants getting caught by leaving isolation. I didn't see any reason to believe anyone other than Sapper left the flower for the replicant mother who represents hope for replicants everywhere. 


Now people keep bringing up the bees and yet I see flowers more likely existing in Sapper's environment than Deckard's. Flowers need sunlight and I didn't see any flowers in Deckard's indoor gardens. Sapper did have access to sunlight and could reasonably be able to grow healthy flowers in some corner of his farm (his qualification that it was a protein farm suggests that plant products can be farmed as well). 


I really don't understand how Deckard having bees in a place where flowers would have trouble growing means that he took any enormous risk and went through a lot of trouble (that would also be out of character) to visit Rachel's grave."
325,do3a7d9,"To be honest, I had a different take on the bees.

When K first visits Wallace's building, and they put that little glass globe into the machine to read the archive or whatever, it plays Deckard's old interrogation of Rachel.

One of the questions is 'what would you do if a wasp landed on your hand?' She answers with 'kill it,' passing the test and proving herself a replicant.

K _doesn't_ kill the one that lands on his hand, and then doesn't harm any of the dozens that cling to him after. He 'fails the test' and in doing so proves his 'humanity.'

Granted, the one above could be correct, or both could, but that is what I took away from it."
326,do52ttf,"In the city and billboards, yeah, but not when Harrison Ford says ""Want some whisky?"" and pulls out a camera-facing Johnnie Walker Black."

329,dnzd69p,tfw in 2049 even Chads are into waifus
330,dnzchf0,"You know it makes me wonder if we’ll look at this ""movement"" of worshipping fictional creations as something much different when tech similar to the one in BR2049 is fully realized. It’s easy to see loners as pathetic losers when their affections are for lifeless 2D renderings. 

...but when it’s Ana De Armas? A ""living and breathing"" supermodel? Who could actually fault someone for pining for her?"
331,dnzlcd9,"If she looks like Joi does ? fuck yea I wanna digital waifu.

I have a feeling Ana de armas is gonna be getting a lot more calls to play significant roles after this one"
332,dnzediv,I really liked that too. It's a great way of referencing the debate on whether Deckard is a replicant or not.
333,dnz0joa,"I don’t think she’s the only memory maker, but she’s the best so Wallace uses her. She mentions that all memories have a fragment of their creator, but it’s also illegal to implant real memories. I think she was the one who lived the memory, and maybe altered it slightly to give to K (and maybe other replicants too)."
334,dnz133f,"K was a decoy replicant that was implanted with her memories so that if he was discovered, they'd kill him and assume he was the only child and that would be that. 

The issue is that he was the Blade Runner that uncovered the whole thing and not someone else. The replicant resistance leader explained that to him after they rescued him. All he was was a decoy. The daughter was hidden in the orphanage to hide her while K was sent into the world with the assumption being hed be found and killed."
335,dnz9xli,"When K failed his test I'm pretty sure that she saved his ass. My guess is, and I don't think that it's too integral to the story is that she may have become a bit sympathetic to him as a character and allowed him to get away. I also think that she had a pretty big soft spot for all the good work that he's done and when Luv Came to kill him she sought to protect him."
336,do836ou,"Man, you know shit's rough when this nightmare of a movie is escapism"
337,dnzc8m4,Honestly I've gone at length about it but that relationship was so well done that it is easily the best virtual realtionship in film. Joi is an incredibly important part of K's life and in the end both were able to find meaning through eachother.  
338,do1rn1d,"I think Joi’s sentience developed throughout the film, at first she was trying to serve K’s every whim, switching into different outfits from second to second, and it fell a bit into the uncanny valley. After she gained the portable device and learnt that K was “born”, she became more proactive, settled in her appearance and even assertive in some situations, and we start seeing her as an individual rather than a tool, which ties nicely into the theme of the entire franchise."
339,dnzhotg,"It looks like, by 2049, pretty much everyone with money went offworld. "
340,dnztrpt,"The most striking piece of world building for me was when they panned over one of the holographic dancers. Across it scrolled ""Made in CCCP"" (CCCP being Russian for USSR). So by 2019 and even 2049, the Soviet Union is still around. With this and the protein farm greenhouses we see in the first scene with Cyrillic script, they have a commercial presence in the United States.

It begs the question, could the Soviets have won? Or have enough of the aristocracy of the world gone off it that the Cold War just didn't matter anymore?"

344,dnz4gsg,I loved the bit where they showed the looming dark shadowy buildings of the Wallace Corporation. The music there was terrifying.
345,dnz9ipy,"The part where k was being analyzed verbally blew me away. I saw it in IMAX and with a good sound system. I think what stunned me was how fast k reacted to the questions and commands so it gives you the feeling that he's not human enough to highlight the fact the he's a replicant but still subtly realize that he's being interrogated and feels slightly nervous. Just about every shot of the city had me grinning like a fool, not to mention Ana De Armas looking stunning as usual. I was also not prepared for the first fight scene, but damn it was brutal and awesome. Everyone had an excellent performance and even though everyone either loves or hates Jared Leto, I thought he was great.Blade Runner 2049 definitely deserve a shit ton of Oscar nominations and at least a win for best cinematography and score."
346,dnz9c69,It encapsulates the beauty of free will. It's something so powerful that we take for granted. 
347,dnz5zab,"2006, someone nudges you while watching Batista stumble through another shitty promo and tells you that he's going to be a wonderful actor some day in the fucking BLADE RUNNER SEQUEL. "
348,dnzbwif,He's way better than the Rock imo. He actually picks decent films.
349,dnzf5z5,"He’s making some good choices with his career by choosing smaller roles and not trying to force it by attempting to be a leading man. 

I thought he was perfect in this, and completely memorable. "
350,dnzbf68,"Ehhhh, I dont quite buy that his Joi had zero agency. We've already seen humanity get too far ahead of itself in its creations accidently getting agency (thats the whole plot of the first movie with the Replicants). Joi seems to go above and beyond a simple companion bot with her actions towards the end.

Edit:

But if something is capable of ""being whatever you want me to be"", that implies necessitates a possibility for VERY powerful programming. I mean if Wallace advertised his Replicants with the tag line ""be whatever you want me to be"", does that automatically change the theme of the last two movies and make K and Rachel just preprogrammed automatons? Because that was the prejudice if humanity in the first (and still exists in the second) movies.


The whole theme of the movies are that even though the replicants are created with a specific artificial and designed purpose, they are still capable of gaining agency and choosing within the restraints imposed on them. I agree Joi is limited. But I question whether in her limitations she was still able to choose, feel emotions, and make decisions in a fashion where she had agency"
351,do0xrfq,"Dude, and the sound design for everything too. The audio effects were sooo good. Subtle and smooth, yet I almost felt like I was in the room. One of the first things I noticed when K stepped into the room with the pot bubbling."
352,do0ok61,"It's because Bautista is ugly. Not hideous or malformed, but he's not a beautiful man, and he's huge and scarily muscular as well. He said in an interview once that he understands why he only gets roles where he plays fighters or thugs: he knows that he's frightening looking. There's a sadness there that he draws on. I don't think someone like Dwayne Johnson really has the same range. "
353,dnzioic,I realized very quickly into that opening scene that he was not going to make it far into the film and was a little sad about it. He's become such a good actor.
354,dnz1vuy,"it was slow but it shouldn't be fast, every scene was filled with tension and emotion and the score was incredible"
355,dnzeo59,"She was not immunocompromised! That was part of the red herring. The memories of the orphanage were her own. She was fine around people. Additionally, the story she tells K is fabricated. "
356,do118ei,"That dog was, funny to say, a really good actor. He behaved like a real dog. When Deckard gets up and walks away from the bar the dog starts wagging his tail and then just loyally follows him. Most dog actors are looking off camera at the trainer or are constantly anxious and panting. "
357,dnzyp7v,who is gonna feed him
358,dnzlc3m,"This is officer K.'s story. In many ways, the world he's in proved to be beyond his reach. He thought he was special, & because of that he was as human as a replicant can get. The irony is that he did feel & act in the most human of ways, all throughout."
359,dnz9ue2,"""Her eyes were green."""
360,dnz3iuf,"i definitely looks a little bit off, but i think it fits the scene perfectly since deckard (and us as viewer) was supposed to tell there's a little off about it."
361,dnz8q5l,Pornhub is gonna need a Superposition category now. 
362,dnz5w7h,I absolutely thought of Her. I love how the original Blade Runner dealt with replicants and this one deals significantly with the software itself. It feels like a modern examination of the original's theme of AI.
363,dnzesk9,"It’s not too often that you think “Well *that’s* something I haven’t seen before.”

This movie had a number of those moments. One that sticks out in my mind right now is the stairwell lit with reflections on water. Simply stunning. "
364,dnz5g9u,I think that was the most Harrison Ford line ever. It was so grumpy old man that it almost made me laugh. 
365,dnz4ede,"This is just my interpretation but I just thought they sent only Joe because they thought he was disposable.If he died,too bad,we'll send in an army.If he succeed,great no need for further waste.It also helped that he's very good at his job(I mean did you see him shooting with incredible precision) and bio-engineered to be better than Nexus 6."
366,dnz134f,A masterpiece for our ages.
367,dnz4tsm,"He didn't do anything to Joker, that was the script, the direction, the costume, the make-up, the editing, the sexualization of the character, and just the overall ill-fitting pimp/street punk aesthetic. Literally everything around his performance of that character was fucked but his actual performance of what was written for him was fine.  Maybe a little too far on the creepy side but otherwise fine. He really wasn't the issue."
368,dnzca6k,Fuck

370,dnz3tkk,"I kinda laughed at the “instant connection” bit. The Deckard/Rachel “romance” is so empty and bland. I felt more from their relationship from Harrison’s acting near the end, so that made up for it."

383,dnz85t5,"Yeah, I’m super confused as to what to make of that still. 

The opening text seemed to pretty definitively say “yes” but the nature of Deckard’s story made it seem like he was some kind of Human Sperm donor. "
384,do1vude,"A real human being

Wait "
385,do1c2y0,"But he also follows the rules. Definitely attractive, don't be unattractive."
386,do1x7c5,Just let me wear it
387,do1kz3r,Those colors. The scenes at the Tyrell corporation building were mesmerizing.
388,dnzbqms,K's car got harpooned with a big metal kite and what I assume is persistent lightning in the area shorted out his electronics. 
389,dnztv83,"Right. The ""soul"" is an arbitrary fiction we use to try to give ourselves more meaning. Or in this case, an excuse to comfort ourselves when we enslave the replicants."
390,do2n37x,"And Joi has a very similar journey through the movie. Even the other replicants look down on Joi as not being a ""real girl"" and yet by the end of the film, and her death, we see that she is as human as any of the humans or replicants.

I also enjoyed the hypocrisy in this; the replicants should really know better than to look down on her."
391,do2fyf5,"I feel like the moment he realized he wasn't the son was the moment he became human. No longer living someone else's life, but living his own, making is own choice on what to do. Fighting for what matters to him."
392,do0s40r,That's exactly it. Still not sure why and how K got implanted with that memory in the first place though.
393,do14u96,Was that a boy though? When we saw the memory again for the reveal I thought the child could also have been a girl with shorter hair. A bit like that reveal in The Dark Knight Rises 
394,dnzk5s7,">The only thing I'm curious of, is whether Ana (memory maker) really needs to be in that dome

I can't imagine so. That seems like a nice lie to keep her away from contact with others specifically so a bladerunner can't test her to see if she is human. Everything else about the plan to hide her was perfect, why wouldn't they also cover that base?

I think so too. This movie is on par with the original though very different in tone and scope. To me it is the perfect sequel in that way. It is like Alien and Aliens, both are amazing movies and the sequel has a different tone but expands the scope of the universe so much. "
399,do1s1bg,"I had just thought of that - 
for the replicants  there was a serial number embedded at the bottom of the eyeball- but not for Wallace since he had f'd up eyeballs, possibly gouging out his eyes - and that's why he's blind"
400,do0z6l7,Thats when K lost the connection too 
401,do13no3,"But they're customizable. Our personalities are shaped by experience, as an AI's would be. It's also more about what she represented to K than her as an individual- the whole ""what you want to hear"" thing is pretty big. And it plays into the bigger theme of what it is to be human or have a soul. "
402,do0ce87,"Except he chose to be special. He decided that he wasn't going to kill Deckard  he chose for himself.  He didn't obey like he was designed to do. 

By sheer factor of deciding for himself who he is,  he became human and therefore as special as the daughter because he also broke the mold of a replicant."
403,do209p1,I honestly thought he just had implants or some shit like the Illusive Man from Mass Effect. But than scene with him and Deckard sealed it for me that he was legit blind.
404,dob9jsb,I'm pretty sure they are supposed to be ultrasonic transceivers. That's why they placed the two little gadgets below his ears and why the make funny clicking noises. It makes him see like a bat with echolocation.
405,dnzo3o7,"Hes probably aware why she calls him Joe, since he probably got her because of the ad.  The iteration of Joi that he grew accustomed to is gone tho. And he's haunted by her facsimile."
406,do1xvnt,">  would say whatever she wanted to hear  

id disagree there a bit, for the AI to realize her death was imminent and to say those words does transcend the dimension.   

she could have said save me or bye but chose not to.  
There was a choice/decision to go through that route   
K's wish would have been to save her but she cant do that. To go through that response is something really weird. It doesn't help K's cause while he lays battered on the floor   "

408,do0zfgl,Reminded me of [TARS](https://youtu.be/wVEfFHzUby0?t=6)
409,do3vojp,Watching Deckard get winded punching K was both hilarious and rather poignant in showing their differences.
410,do0re2s,"Yeah, I was both anticipating and dreading something like:

Deckard: ""Like tears in rain....""

K: ""What?""

Deckard: (chuckles quietly) ""Nothing. Just something a man said to me one time.""

Glad they didn't go that route. I liked that all the ""callbacks"" were pretty blatant and part of the plot. I guess that means they weren't really callbacks. They didn't wink at the audience and the film was stronger for it."
411,do4d8sd,"I agree that it's likely Sapper. He was just honoring ""the miracle"" he referred to when talking to K. Gives him hope in their race that they're more than just machines made for slave labor. "
412,do42ul6,This is nuts. Holy fuck
413,doc12gh,"There was a lot going on with the bees. Certainly could have been a call back to Rachael's Voight-Kampff response, but I think this cake has got a few layers. Villeneuve may have been drawing a line between the eusocial organization of bees and a human society which relies on an infertile labor force. Worker bees are unable to reproduce, but cooperate and contribute to the overall success of the brood--so maybe K recognizes his own analogue.

"
414,do7cbwb,"I thought the answer about killing the bee was the right answer, or the ""human"" answer, and that's why it took so long.  

""Took more than a hundred for Rachel, didn't it?"""

422,dnza1q7,"To take it even further. 

1. I think she was into him sexually/romantically. 
2. I think she’d developed the same hopes and emotions they all know they’re not supposed to have. 

As I think about it, she’s kind of becoming my emotional hook to the film, weirdly. "
423,do11p6h,I think it's tied with Her
424,do2qhj8,But that is already discussed in the orignal bladerunner. 2019 most rich people went off world and the rest got left behind essentially.

432,dnzbmuy,"That's why I already love this film. So many ways to interpret the characters. For me, the confirmation that she had no agency came from the final billboard ""Everything you want to hear!"", and the line earlier in the movie ""You don't have as much going on up there as you think."" I'm sure K's Joi thought she loved him, but that was just her programming fulfilling a need she saw in its owner. "
433,do1fbzt,"He mentioned in an interview that for this role he was blown away by the sheer depth of the director's input in that he was instructed in which manner to act and got feedback for every minutia of his work. It helped guide his process very well.

If you ask me, the guy's simply humble and willing to work on himself."
434,do13k52,"I'm not sure. Her cover story had her growing up normal but getting sick. That detail could be true. She is half-replicant after all so who knows what biological issues that might involve. It's totally conceivable that it's only a cover story, but voluntarily condemning yourself to life in a bubble seems a little radical and unnecessary."

437,dnzkvgt,"I loved the slight annoyance on Wallace's face by that. He thought he was perfect in his adaptation but he was *just* off.

Even the nod he gives for the killing is so slight."
438,dnzvsqy,Damn good acting. You could really see his world come crashing down. The idea that they all just want to be born and loved hits hard.
439,do29qmo,"Lol, isn't it great? 

The film has the exact same deceptive simplicity that the original does. It's the epitome of a worthy successor. 

I'm gonna try to rewatch it soon - it's a BR film so I wanna dig in after all. "

445,do5os6q,K and the Real Girl
446,do13wtc,Holy crap
447,do2uur2,"I think it's a really powerful statement. It's like replicants say you don't need to be born to be real, and she's proving the point you don't need to be physical to be real (also not unique, there are presumably many men that love her and she loves, since she is a product). I think the closest thing I can think of is post civil rights black and white supporters who were still anti-gay. Just like... Come the fuck on."
448,do0v62n,"K was set up as the perfect decoy to protect Deckard and Rachel's daughter. And it worked, since he and Wallace believed it until close to the end.

Edit: as pointed out further in the thread, another possibility is that he was in fact her real brother who didn't die and the memory was his, which she realized."
449,do17q71,"I wonder if maybe some, maybe all replicants have this memory. As the hooker/revolutionary is leaving K's apartment, she takes a long look at the horse on his bedside table. The film directly connects it to the fact that it's made from a tree, which she has never seen before, but I wonder if perhaps she is remembering hiding the horse as well. "
450,do0jbfw,..which echoes the final scenes with Roy in the original.
451,do27uk8,My theory is he's a replicant built from Tyrells remains and that's why he's missing his eyes. Probably not true but I find it fun. 
452,do3ivgu,"i think it would be unrealistic to think that K didn't know about there being endlessly many other Joi's. I think it is fitting for him just being an ""Average Joe"" to have an average life with having basicly a mass-product as his life's companion.
But her character was actually great! 
K is told that sacrificing one's own life is the most human thing one can do. And Joi actually did exactly that - she told him to transfer her onto his mobile projector thingy so she cannot be used to tell the police everything. She completely knows, that it makes her mortal (if we accept that she is alive) ""just like a real person"" (or something similar - i forgot her exact words)."
453,do2916h,"*""Exactly what you want to hear...""*

In that moment, her AI decided exactly what Joe wanted to hear was ""I love you."" I couldn't empathize with Joe over her loss the same way I did with Joaquin Phoenix in *Her* because Joi is programmed to please, but the AI in *Her* is a general AI with its own wants and needs. Joi is just a specific AI program.

Suuuper interesting. Loved that component."
454,do2b2xd,Yes. The imperfections made it perfect. 
455,do1exp2,"yeah, k looking up at the snowfall was Totally mirrowing the tears in rain sequence, and the fact he didn't say anything and just laid down, ...time to die... was perfect.

the length of the shot was probably the same... except there was no deckard there to listen.  i bet you could sync them up pretty easily... i bet...

457,doc862c,"not in the Blade Runner universe, where real animals and insects are incredibly rare; 


it was definitely one of Rachel's incorrect answers. "

465,dnzc0fc,"> ""You don't have as much going on up there as you think.""

See I absolutely LOVED this line on so many levels. The most obvious is the irony that one artificially created life (a replicant) is looking down on another artifical life (AI). This is an INCREDIBLY human moment. She mirrors to a ""T"" what humans do to her. Human history is littered with marginalized groups finding other marginalized groups to look down on to validate themselves (Civil War era Irish and African Americans is the most well known). Even the lowest of humans (as you can see in the film) can think ""well at least im not a Skinjob"", and thus the same she does in regards to ""at least Im better than an AI"".

I think its true that Joi is limited. But I think she showed she could choose and act within her limitations as she decided to see fit in order to express what she wanted. A toddler is limited in what it can think, express, and do as well. But I dont think we would say a toddler has no agency.

That can get you very far in a particular craft. Raw dedication and deliberate practice are amazing for improving dramatically if you are consistent and don't give up."

468,do11ijk,I love that so much. How badly it must irk him that even after everything he has accomplished he STILL could not match Tyrell.
469,do2qd37,"i don't think he died. i think they were coupling the bleeding with the snow as two different realizations of K's ""realness"" or humanization"

472,do3wasf,"I loved almost all of the movie except the flash backs, they were unecessary and that line.  K's death added emotional weight and parralleled Roy ie they saved Deckard.  But I feel like that message is just bad.  The most human thing to do is persevere and endure like Deckard.  I would've preferred seeing K survive to learn more about his newfound humanity."
473,dnza7c4,The blackout probably took out all the records on Deckard if he was one.
474,dnzkp25,I like that Graf mentions there was something about him something in his eyes. And the eyes are how they know the older replicants. 
475,do19vy7,"K may not even be the only decoy, but one of thousands set up by her."
476,do25c19,If Wallace believed K was the child why did they leave him when they picked up Deckard in Vegas?
477,doeesxr,She didn't have a brother. They listed her as dead and then registered her as a boy; hence the two identical DNA records.

485,do95p9h,"He's dead. The music, editing, and snow were a direct reference to Roy Batty's death at the end of Blade Runner. Both of them just sorta...fade."
486,do2jo25,Yeah but it was playing the same song it plays in the first one when Roy Batty dies.
487,do1y50i,Hence his mistake when making the Rachel clone.
488,do0efqg,Also mentions he is retired. Deckard's job in the first Blade Runner was to retire Replicants.
489,do2v0jk,This is actually what I believe was referred to by the one eyed woman who said all of the replicants who were there at one time thought/wished it was them.
490,do5orlz,"I was asking the same question to myself, so this is what I’ve got. They didn’t think he WAS the child, after all, he told Joshi that he retired the child. She believed it - because she assumed Replicants don’t lie - and told the same story to Luv. 

With allegedly no child alive, the second best thing they could get, was the father. If Deckard was a Replicant he might harbor the secret to reproduction as well or know something about it. K was useless at this point, so they left him.

There’s probably a more elaborate answer out there, but this works for me. Gotta Watch the movie again."

492,dnzagqo,"and a 3rd point-it's Ryan Gosling, and who isn't into Ryan Gosling"
493,do04ktw,"Also the scene looking back on Deckard meeting Rachel where Luv comments about Rachel clearly liking him because she is asking personal questions. 

Then in K's apartment madame asked him to share a childhood memory. Bit of mirroring there. "

495,do0k7o2,"This movie confirmed for me that his right eye is a good quarter of an inch high than his left eye.

Still a handsome man though. "
496,do52k7s,"> Did Rachel actually have green eyes in the original movie? I thought they were brown.

They're brown, Deckard is lying. (I've watched the beginning of BR yesterday evening, after seeing BR2049 two days ago.)

As to why he is lying, it may be to provoke Wallace, to test his reaction, to verify his susceptibility to possible failure. A way to show he has the upper hand on one thing, he knows what happened better than Wallace.

Quite possibly also (very likely actually), a way to get rid of the Rachel copy, before he falls for her, for what is a ghost to him.

Edit: Actually this may be a nod to a controversy in the original BR. Rachel's eyes are brown in all scenes, except when zoomed-in during the Voight-Kampff test, where they sort of look green. Considering the only recording surviving from that era in BR 2049 are from that test, I'm surprised Wallace missed it. I still consider Deckard lied about the eye color to find a flaw, any flaw, in the too perfect copy of his love."
497,do88k5j,"> the Voight-Kampff test

Yes, I think this may be a reference for fans who noticed the Voight-Kampff test stock footage didn't match up with the actors irises."

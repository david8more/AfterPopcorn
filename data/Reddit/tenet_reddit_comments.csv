0,g30sw24,My friend went to use the bathroom twice and each time he asked me what he'd missed when he returned. I honestly had no idea what to say.
1,g33ho4u,"Michael Caine’s appearance felt very much like Nolan realized deep into production, “oh shit, we forgot the obligatory Caine inclusion!” and then quickly threw something in."
2,g30c34t,RIP thug who got disfigured with a cheese grater.
3,g30qlzw,"*""If he succeeds it'll destroy every single living thing on Earth""*  
*""Including* *my son"" (despairs)*

Anyone else burst out laughing?"
4,g30udnh,">!I feel like Nolan missed a beat not having the finale set alongside the concert raid at the start. It would have finished the whole palindrome structure but for some reason they set it in an abandoned city and mining tunnel. We know that Neil was there but we never really find out why?!< Overall enjoyed it, just think it missed a few things."
5,g30cczn,you know what is quite interesting? the forward going protagonist never catches a single inverted bullet or manipulates an inverted object after the concept is introduced. I feel like they should have done something with that.
6,g38ugv4,I’m like 70 percent sure they just found Micheal Caine eating his lunch and then just put a camera on him.
7,g340jk3,"Could somebody explain me while The Protagonist cared so much about keeping Kenneth Branagh's wife safe? He brags about following the ""standard procedure"" but then hands a case full of world-ending shit to the villain just to save one sad woman. Are we supposed to care for her well-being when the future of humanity is at stake?"
8,g2zqip6,"“It’s not Estonian, it’s backwards”

I moved to Tallinn 18 months ago, this is how I feel 24/7"
9,g3212e1,Anyone noticed the music was reversed for blue team?
10,g313oof,That boat windsurfer thing scene was kinda stupid
11,g349iav,Nolan's next film will just be 2 hours of him masturbating in front of a clock.
12,g37tg40,"The movie literally tells you not to think about it too much, but if you don't think about it then you don't understand what's going on, and if you do think about it you easily poke holes through the internal logic of the movie.

I've never seen a movie with so much exposition that still didn't make sense."
13,g300qd3,"I’m reminded of one of those Zero Punctuation reviews.

“Do you really care that much about sound mixing?”

“No, I fucking don’t! So imagine how bad it has to be for me to notice it!”"
14,g31geg0,"By the time I left the theater, I wasn't even sure what English sounded like anymore."
15,g32ij5x,Holy shit when Robert Pattinson is talking about the world ending and Kat says “my son included” I fucking died laughing.
16,g2yuajb,Seeing the Airport fight from both perspectives of time was really cool.
17,g2zn6d6,"Elizabeth Debicki is just towering over everyone, was great"
18,g36rxwd,Do you think poo goes back up their bums when they sit on the toilet
19,g2ywy83,"If you have a hard time hearing dialogue in movies at home...

*...oooooh boy*"
20,g2ztt37,"I appreciate everyone trashing the sound mixing, but how about that final action scene when they attack the ruined city? Who are they shooting at? Is it henchmen? I can't think of who else it would be but we see like fifty good guys and I think two bad guy corpses and I just felt confused as to why they needed that much firepower."
21,g2zcni5,"Some bits were so realistic, like the BMW parked in a bike lane!"
22,g2yusjr,"I need to watch this again. With subtitles.

Edit: OK, I watched it with subtitles. I was surprised at how many things I had missed. Such as the ending in Stalsk-12 with the blue team and the red team happening at the same time as the Opera sequence at the start. Also, if you guys have seen that fan theory that Neil is Max - it's definitely not true. Neil tells the Protagonist: ""You have a future in the past"". Basically the Protagonist goes years back into the past and that's how Neil first met him, i.e. Neil is not from the future, so he can't be Kat's son."
23,g30kmxm,Kenneth Branagh's fitbit for best supporting actor.
24,g2znnkl,Lol everyone who torrents this movie is going to think the file is corrupted.
25,g30fp0z,Sator bouncing down the side of the boat at the end was the most grounded part of the whole movie
26,g34l65x,"**S A T O R**

**A R E P O**

**T E N E T**

**O P E R A**

**R O T A S**

is a Square palindrome in which 5 key aspects of the movie are or take place in

*SATOR* is the bad guy

*AREPO* is the character that essentially brought the Protagonist closer to Sator 

*TENET* well name of movie + organisation Protagonist is involved with

*OPERA* is where the movie starts off and the protagonist stuns Sator by mentioning it

*ROTAS* is the name of the shipping company/vault company that stored the painting 

Also TE(N)ET is Ten and Ten backwards which signifies the final act of the movie where the Blue team has 10 minutes in real time and the Red team has 10 minute in backwards time.

Credit to some YouTube comments lol"
27,g2zqu4t,The most unrealistic part of this film was that there were people talking to each other in an Estonian tram
28,g30by21,Think Nolan got a bit jealous of his brother confusing everyone with Westworld.
29,g2zv7ht,"To Doctor Who fans: this is River Song if she was a Christopher Nolan movie. 

That’s the best way I could describe this movie."
30,g30b5q8,"One thing that doesn’t seem to have been mentioned yet is that this is the first Nolan film for ages that wasn’t cut by his usual editor Lee Smith. Instead this one was cut by Noah Baumbach collaborator Jennifer Lame (a really curious choice for a high-concept action movie). 

I wonder if Smith deserves way more credit for his ability to unpack Nolan’s ideas in a way that the audience is able to follow. For me if anything it was the editing in Tenet that let the film down the most. The pacing in the first act is completely wrong, and many of the more complex set pieces are flat out impossible to follow.

I also wonder if they went with Jennifer Lame in the hope of she would bring out the emotional side of the story. Feels like a really bad decision because that is largely something that needed to happen in the writing."
31,g36ups5,"First time I've ever agreed with those critics who call Nolans films ""cold"" or ""emotionless"". I genuinely didn't care about a single character in this film because the film itself never even attempted to make me. Somewhere in here there's a great film, but the actual end project is unfortunately very far from that."
32,g30lfp3,"Ok I think I got most of it. 

Some dickhead in the future sends the technology back in time, and the dickhead in the present runs into it. I don't get what their plan was, though. 

The bad guy has been going back and forth and leaving messages to himself, which gives him a huge advantage when it comes to scheming. I'm not sure how to understand the particulars though. 

The fight in the storage unit is absolutely fucking perfect. It blows my mind just thinking about it. The first time we think that our protagonists are suddenly ambushed by these weird sci-fi soldiers, but through skill and wit they manage to gain the upper hand, and it culminates with one of the attackers flying into an exploding jet engine. Fight won, our heroes have prevailed. Then you watch it in reverse and you realize that the time inverted fighter(s) were in complete control the whole time. Absolutely brilliant.

It's not clear to me how driving works, and the highway scene still has me 100% confused. I don't understand how the interactions with the reversed drivers are supposed to work. I freely admit I won't make any sense of it until I rewatch it."
33,g30rni5,"I feel like the Indian plot thread and Michael Cane's scene could've been taken out of the movie and it wouldn't have changed a whole lot. Maybe it was important though, I just couldn't hear it."
34,g2yyp7a,"Despite the fact that the film has no dialogue other than expository, I just couldn't follow it. It made me feel dumb, but not as in a ""I just need to grow as a person dumb"" like for instance in some auteur or philosophical films. I feel plain stupid for not getting this film. In a way I think Nolan gets off wanting me to feel this way. Soundtrack was my taste, characters bland, story incomprehensible. Might give it another try."
35,g31se4e,"Apart from the obvious annoying dialogue issues, one thing I did find interesting was the >!world ending scenario at the end. There is 0 evidence that the world was going to end, the characters that the protagonist would eventually hire himself only repeated to him what he told them. It's a loop, a paradox. ""Blind faith"" - like what the russian guy said!<"
36,g2zimqg,"Who did the sound mixing for this movie? 

Don’t worry, I just want to talk."
37,g2ythr5,"Dear christ, the audio mixing.

Set pieces were wonderful though."
38,g302s4l,"It's kinda sad that the whole movie's title and several references allude to the [Sator Square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sator_Square), but it doesn't actually play a role, and noone here in the comments mentioned it either. I thought it was cool that a movie about reversing time is named after the central word in a reversing poem, with all the other words playing a central role too.  

Edit: So reading through its wiki, the square is actually really cool, and there's way more references to it than just the words in it."
39,g3056cx,I for one enjoyed John David Washington’s take on James Bond
40,g342whu,"Hahahha found this on Rotten Tomatoes (from critic Christina Newland) and I think it sums up my thoughts perfectly:

""Tenet is a locked puzzle box with nothing inside."""
41,g2zckbb,"All I want to say is that there is a river outside of the theatre where I saw this, and the first thing I saw when I walked out of the theatre was a group of swans who appeared to be moving backwards through the river"
42,g2yugw5,"This film will be better in foreign language countries, as subtitles will mean you’ll be able to see the dialogue! Without subtitles it’s difficult to keep up. But the set pieces are amazing, the actors are especially charismatic for a Nolan film and the backwards time concept was great. 

A lot of reviews I’ve read mention it will take multiple viewings to ‘get’ what’s going on, but I don’t think the plot would be especially difficult to follow if you could actually hear what was being said."
43,g36jseg,"Okay so I don't know what happened but- 

**No matter how much of that is due to me being dumb, at least part of it is due to the film's inability to dole out exposition in an understanding enough way, and also the ridiculous sound choices.**

People are talking into masks from the moment this film begins.

People are talking into cups *while they're drinking*. 

Kenneth Branagh has a mumbly Russian accent I can't understand.

There's a scene where people are talking into microphones, *using exposition jargon*, *while* on a boat, *while* the music is blaring and the water's going past.

People are talking into masks while a firefight is going on while explosions are happening. 

Almost the entire film's runtime is exposition for the concept *while it's happening.* Not exposition before action, and then having it been introduced enough where we can enjoy our understanding of it.

The only times I got where I was narratively were at the inverted fight, and when Elizabeth Debicki seeing the other woman jump off the boat clicked.

It's ridiculous.

But so far as I can tell, Russian bad guy wants to destroy the world- to potentially make a better one where the Soviet Union didn't get blown up by radiation? 

And with the Grandfather Paradox, our main characters don't know whether or not him doing it will destroy their world or another one, like if they do bad things like before if it'll ruin it or not, but they're trying not to. 

Also I called Robert Pattinson being his future friend from before the moment he said;

'Get him a diet Coke.'

'I prefer Soda Water'

'No you don't.'

Okay so Robert Pattinson's from the future where he's met JDW before, got it. Yeah I've seen The Time Traveler's Wife and also one time travel film before ever. 

It turned out to be they've met in the past and our protagonist has set things up telling him all the events of the film already, I guess? He just doesn't know, so he can't see himself, it's like a drop-off of information through RPatz and Elizabeth Debicki at the end. But they still have to do it.

So timeline, our main boy is talking to RP giving him all the info, basically a time travel plot but before our main guy in the first timeline meets him. He doesn't tell him any of this in case things go differently and they don't know what'll happen if a person sees themselves from the future. I think someone mentioned an explosion of cells but I can't be sure.

What's the point though? Like emotionally, I get it's to save the world, but if I can't see the consequences or direct result of pain that it causes people, then I can't connect, like there's nothing to hold on to. 

I like Robert Pattinson, didn't even catch he was called Neil. I like Elizabeth Debicki, but beyond a couple cliched abuse scenes, didn't feel too engaged. 

I really wanted to see the future, where people were sending things back in time, like at some point it's gonna kick into gear and we'll see JDW in the future or someone fighting just before the big apocalypse happens that y'know, causes the inversion.

Their friendship and that moment where JDW is tearing up at the end when he's gonna sacrifice himself, when I should be emotional instead I'm like;

*'Oh yeah*, was that RPatz that got shot in the head in front of him at the end two seconds ago then?'

If they'd slowed down and given me that relationship in this film, all the moments I should have been seeing, then it'd have affected me more. 

It's like making a film that you'll understand a second time, but it's like, why?

Inception had Cobb, Mal, a bit of humour through JGL and Tom Hardy, and even the emotion of Cillian Murphy, the villain and his Dad. A villain and his Dad had more emotional connect than most of this film for me. And that film still didn't have enough character moments for me, this one has fewer rather than the other way around.

This entire film should have been full of scenes like Robert Pattinson saying 'That part is a *little* bit dramatic', that relationship should be taking up the *entire* film, not sidelined by it.

I really enjoyed the action stuff surrounding the fire and car chasing, and I do love the concept. It just didn't really have an emotional connect.

If a film is a running coach who's job is to teach you exposition of how to run alongside and also entertain and impress through their ability to run so you can both get to the finish line, then this one is a coach that runs farther ahead, shouts into the wind for you to keep up and then reaches it before you, and you never learned what you needed to to get proper running technique, and they never slow down, so you give up and walk home without your reaching the finish line."
44,g2zzxtj,"I genuinely have a headache after watching. Not because of plot complexity, but because I had to STRAIN to try and hear the dialogue. Still a fun movie but holy shit that sound mix was atrocious."
45,g32adjg,"I wouldn't say the time inversion plot is that difficult to understand in hindsight of the third act. What I was genuinely confused was motivation of most of the main characters, it all felt so superficial and bordering on parody at times. I think the acting was great all around considering the awful dialogue, but the actual plot which set this time shenanigans in motion was just not very well developed at all. 

Also, I know this is Nolan's style, but the quick cuts between scenes with very little establishing shots really took me out of the movie a lot of times. 

The ending ""battle"" looked like a paintball game. Who is fighting who?

I have to think about this a bit more, but I'm not sure I'd say this was anything amazing."
46,g2yyf58,"To everyone who speaks English as their first language.

Ever wanted to know what English sounds like to someone who does not speak it? Watch Tenet without subtitles. 

This whole movie feels like someone took a shit in your ears and you cannot clean it out. 

Sound is 100x more important than the visual and I think Christopher Nolan forgot that.

Also if anybody could explain the plot, please explain it to me. I swear I’m not dumb I just couldn’t hear a fucking line of dialogue."
47,g33n5y7,"So we’re all gonna pretend that we liked AND understood this movie before the Americans come in here, right!?"
48,g30nfva,"Nolan literally wrote a whole scene about the importance of an emotional core to a narrative in Inception and seems to forget it completely until the 11th hour, so he gives Elizabeth Debicki a son.

edit:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l\_dDXhzgsx4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_dDXhzgsx4)"
49,g2ywslv,"Typically in a movie with this much convoluted plot, and constant exposition,  you need characters to follow and care about. I did not care for a single character in this movie. Even the protagonist is literally called The Protagonist and you get little to no time with Debicki and her son to feel any stakes with their separation. Everyone else is too busy explaining the plot (inaudibly) to have any level of emotion or character. But yes the set pieces were fantastic"
50,g2zoy96,"I loved Robert Pattinson. Seeing him in Tenet makes me so excited for Batman. He was the only fun part of the movie and the inversion gimmick had so much potential to be a lot more fun and a lot less confusing (though maybe my brain is too small to appreciate it /s). I get that fun isn’t Nolan’s thing, but even the big action scenes weren’t terribly compelling. Like at the end with the teams of soldiers just shooting at everything I couldn’t even tell who the bad guys were half the time/where the protagonists were trying to go. It felt really sloppy."
51,g2yut10,I thought a lot of the dialogue was embarrassing. Incredibly clichéd and cheesy to the point you knew what some characters were going to say in advance.
52,g2z1jj3,"If this wasn’t a Nolan movie it would probably have got a way worse critical reception. 

It’s like the inverse of Inception, which was a high concept plot told impeccably well to never make it feel inaccessible. 

Tenet is an equally high concept but told in the most convoluted way possible, making the film super jarring at times and I won’t be surprised if many people struggle to follow it. 

The complete lack of character is a shame as well. There’s basically nobody to root for, or get attached to as everyone is little more than a walking exposition spouting robot. Sort of makes the ‘world is ending’ stakes feels pretty irrelevant. 

The set pieces and incredibly cinematic craftsmanship really carry it, but the needlessly overdressed plot and the emotional coldness really dent the film. 

Oh and the audio mixing fucking suuuucks, like to the point where I would actually recommend you only watch this if you can get it with subtitles."
53,g2ytoif,I simply love Nolans opening sequences.
54,g34bxn9,One thing I haven't seen discussed is the actual use of the word Tenet in the movie. It's explained to The Protagonist that it will open essentially a new world to him. Good doors and bad. But then he uses it like twice and it's never mentioned again. I really thought that was going to play a bigger part of the plot.
55,g2zrw41,"Some thoughts:
- Sweet fuck the sound mixing is bad.
- I feel like this movie needed to get an Inception type of rewrite. I really felt for Cobb in a way I did not feel for ""the Protagonist"".
- shit. They couldn't give the main character a name???
Other than that, I enjoyed the movie."
56,g32aimw,"Elisabeth Debicki just straight up played the same character from The Night Manager.

A police convoy transports plutonium through the center of a city with only two cars and no air support."
57,g309dje,"""Kenneth Branagh revealed that naysayers insisted Christopher Nolan wouldn't be able to finish Tenet (2020) due to the coronavirus lockdown. However, the director persisted with post-production by reducing the mixing room's team of technicians from eleven down to five, and by wearing masks and practicing social distancing""



This is pulled from IMDB trivia and something tells me him reducing the mixing team like that is why the sound design is garbage in some scenes and dialoge nearly unintelligible"
58,g37oag0,"The way Quentin Tarantino has a foot fetish, Nolan must have a fetish for barely audible dialogue. 

He probably pays women to read to him through a closed door while he plays a cello."
59,g2za13m,"It was a mind fuck and legitimately felt like a rollercoaster with the literal loop de loop. 

The sound mixing was terrible, but the casting was on point. Looking forward to a home release with subtitles, maybe even watch it on VLC so I can slow it down 20%.

Still having issues processing the climax. That he could not die, but then did without consequence, made zero sense."
60,g30bkva,"Remember when the movie industry was pushing 3D films so they could charge higher prices for tickets?

I think their new plan is to release films that you have to watch twice to understand."
61,g3328ih,When Neill said “One day maybe I’ll tell you my life story” somehow I came up with the theory that he was Kat and Andrei’s son who had come from the future in order to prevent the end of the world and was the mastermind behind “Tenet”
62,g36frro,Anyone around here remember that scene with the cheese grater? Holy shit I winced at that
63,g2zc13x,"I personally love most of Nolan's movies. The Prestige might be my favorite movie. With that said, Tenet was disappointing. It's not a bad movie, but it's just not very good. The plot is convoluted. The explanations don't make that much sense, and aren't concise - something I felt was quite well done in Interstellar for example. 

It feels like a waste of an idea really. Somehow the movie feels rushed. The dialogue is poor. The romance seems quite forced. There is no great twist to uncover and for attentive viewers most of the smaller twists are obvious.

That said, there are two scenes in particular which I felt were cinematically interesting and well done - the fight with his reverse self and the building retro-exploding and exploding again. It felt like THAT was what the movie should be exploring. 

There's something that bothers me about Nolan. He is obviously quite an intelligent man with clever ideas, and I will always applaud his audacity and I hope he keeps exploring Time as a movie concept. But WHY do we have to keep going to standard movie tropes? Why do we keep having to have guns, and bullets, and explosions? Ever since Inception it feels like he MUST include those things in his movies, and I ask why? Can you imagine the ideas that could've been explored in Inception if the bad guys weren't idiots with guns? Tenet itself could've been a much more interesting movie if we didn't have to resort to this kind of army propaganda. Honestly as I was watching the movie I wondered if there's a studio exec reason behind this. Is it possible that for him to keep having big budgets he must include this common denominator of action-movie tropes? Or is that his preference? I just don't know. The Prestige didn't need this bullshit. Nor did Memento. Nor did Interstellar, and they're all great movies. 

Ah well, Tenet wasn't bad. Just a waste of a good idea on an average execution in my opinion."
64,g593cy6,I am like 95% sure the main character ordered an “expresso” at one point in the movie.  Hard to play James Bond with that kind of dialogue.
65,g2yuo7m,"In my opinion Tenet is Nolan at his worst. It tried way too hard to be complex and the time traveling gimmick could have been explored better. It seemed to me as if it was intentionally convoluted just because this is what one expects from a Nolan flick.

The characters were bland and underdeveloped. Every time the movie tried to pack an emotional punch, it fell flat for me. Moreover, most of the plot twists are predictable if you are paying attention. For example, when Pattinson didn't shoot the masked attacker during the airport sequence, it didn't take much to connect the dots.  

That being said, the concept itself is interesting, it's the execution that is lacking. There are some cool set pieces though. The reverse fight scene of John David Washington from the two POVs was great. The score is also pretty on-point.

Overall, I'd say it is a 7/10 movie at best."
66,g2z8yu1,[deleted]
67,g32pozp,"I... Felt kind of let down by this movie if I'm honest.

It felt like a Nolan movie paint-by-numbers , or something to that effect. There are quite a few weird cuts. I don't think the movie got far enough into the lore after introducing the villain and the inverted tech, it just sort of plateaued. No chemistry between the protagonist and Kat.

Not Terrible, but if there is ever a Nolan boxset this probably will be the weakest one in it.

Pattison was pretty good though."
68,g3t6ln1,How is nobody talking about how dumb the convoy scene was? Oh a truck pulls to our right? Fine. Oh another truck pulls in front of us? Fine. Oh another truck pulls in behind us? Fine. Oh another truck pulls in to the left of us and they attack us? *Surprised Pickachu face*
69,g30qfda,Nevermind this. Was there a Dune trailer?
70,g3aql4f,"Of all the time travel/reality bending films released in the last 20 years, this was absolutely one of them."
71,g2yveqe,"I thought it was a hot mess of a movie and people in my theatre were outright laughing at the dialogue, especially the part where Pattinson, Washington and Debicki are discussing how the whole world will end and everyone will die, and Debicki says ""including my son""...

I'll give it some points for creativity and the score but on the whole this really felt like a jump-the-shark moment for Nolan. I didn't even like the ending action set piece. Felt like the world's most cinematic paintball game."
72,g5n0mi0,"rapid thoughts after having just watched it:

- i'm very glad i watched Dark this year on Netflix as it prepared me for hyper-complicated time travel hi-jinks
- ""If we don't stop bad russian guy then everyone on earth dies!"" ""and my son!"" Cat please I don't care I haven't met the boy
- this movie would benefit greatly from subtitles all the way through, idk if it was just my theater but so much of the movie was unintelligible
- red/blue armbands are not enough to differentiate people in such a noisy, loud battlefield! i need my squad in neon"
73,g3w062s,"Black man going undercover as an Ukrainian SWAT, what a brilliant idea CIA lmao"
74,g6fx4pi,"I'm surprised no one has mentioned anything about this. Apologies in advance, I'm not the most elaborate or well-spoken of people. 

I thought it was a pleasant surprise when we discover who the ""other woman"" jumping off the yacht is, considering the sentiments Kat expressed earlier in the film. To paraphrase, she said something to the effect of being envious of how free and liberated that woman was. How, in that moment, she wished it was her. To see that it was Kat's future self, but with the experiences she had endured throughout the movie and the development of her character, was a wonderful addition to her story. In a film that felt very chaotic and hard to follow, that was a small moment that certainly brought a smile to my face."
75,g2ytxzg,[deleted]
76,g303ue0,"Anyone else felt weird seeing that opening shot of a completely full theater, while sitting very socially distanced yourself?"
77,g3051j9,"I watched this 2 times now. First watch, some of the dialogue was lost due to poor mixing but second time around at a different cinema I was able to understand more of the dialogue.

I very much enjoyed the movie itself. All the action scenes were exciting and exhilarating, with the Nolan magic added adding to my experience. The story itself is par for the course for action blockbusters, though a bit hard to follow at some points (I didn't understand specific point even after second viewing until reading about it on wikipedia). Performances by the cast was outstanding. John Davids Washington's athleticism was on full display while Robert Pattinson provided great banter and chemistry. Although Tenet isn't as well rounded as Inception, Nolan achieved his goal of recreating the thrill and excitement he felt watching spy movies as a kid

eight out of tenet"
78,g30cx4e,"The sound editing was atrocious, it was almost like Nolan wanted to distract you from the complexities of the plot, through noise. Made me think though, was the soundtrack inverted, or designed backwards? Great set pieces, however, the narrative was like wading through a swamp."
79,g6rx3wv,"If I had heard the words ""my son"" one more time during the movie I would have screamed."
80,g2z6lin,"Feels like a movie that intentionally makes things more confusing than they need to be. And it's in everything, from the way they withold information to the way the audio is mixed so you have to strain to hear every line of dialogue (in IMAX at least). The only scenes I understood without effort was the scene with the woman explaining the bullets. The exposition scene in the trainyard and on the boat early on were incomprehensible

The set up with the Russian and the wife felt very Bond, but weirdly soulless. I didn't really care about the characters. Compare that to Inception where Cobb's marriage issues are the most intriguing part of the film. 

I thought the movie really hit a standstill when JDW gets on the Russians boat to befriend him or whatever. Got good again with the car chase

The confusion thing I mentioned earlier worked very well in the scene where he first enters the machine, where you see JDWs perspective on one side of the glass where you only hear his conversation, then the same again on the other side of the glass where you hear the Russians."
81,g305qyt,"It felt like a regression from Nolan, like it was a prototype for Inception. No meaningful character arcs, no emotional stakes, none of the clarity or focus of his previous work & actively worse dialogue.

Compare the opening to this to, say, the bank heist from Dark Knight. Both are tense & gripping but with the Dark Knight you understand everything that is going on from the get-go. You know what the two opposing sides are and you know their goals. With Tenet, Nolan gives you nothing. It all looks cool but I had no idea who was who or what they're trying to do.

This is a problem that spans the whole film. I struggled to properly understand the overall mission which was exacerbated by the fact that it was actually quite a dull mission. Typical end of the world extreme peril nonsense that is hard to care about because it's so over the top. It was Michael Bay territory. 

The more I think about it, the more I think the climax is pretty terrible. The final set piece is a cluttered, convoluted mess. Nolan tries to pull the trick of weaving in two narratives into one to create something heightened and dramatic but it just doesn't work. The yacht scenes felt so lacking, I didn't believe the relationship between the characters and I didn't care. The action stuff in the desert was even worse. Genuinely had no idea how to follow what was going on. By the end of it, I was more relieved it was over than happy that they succeeded.

Coherence went out of the window in the 3rd act in this film. The best scenes were the ones where Nolan explored the main concept of inversion in a way that was clear to the audience. The inverted fight in the art depot was fantastic, especially with the way you saw both sides of it. It was actually pretty terrifying seeing how unpredictable your assailant is when they're going backwards in time. The first time the main character steps into the inverted world was surreal and gorgeous. But by the end of film, Nolan just goes too far with his ambition because the end mission is a blob of inverted mush.

All in all, I'm pretty disappointed. I'm probably going to rewatch it and maybe it will improve slightly but there is nothing really to come back to other than to make more sense of the plot. I think Nolan needs to have a completely different mindset with his next film because he is verging on self-parody now."
82,g2ywqxl,Anyone spot that Neil saves the Protagonists life right at the very beginning during the opera scene?
83,g33y62q,"Saw it yesterday night.

Quite a disapoitment.

The airport scenes were nice, the opera scene too and i liked the small part when they trap the convoy (but not the whoel car scene). The way too long and boring battle at the end killed all my enjoyement of this movie. Not one scene in the future, wtf ? How is an algorithm a machine ? How does this even stop someone else from making it or going back to try to get it again ? What was the point of talking about touching the other self if it never happen ?

The sound mixing was atrocious, you could not hear what half the actors were saying.

I really liked the Robert Pattinson and Kenneth Branagh but damn John David Washington has as much emotion as a brick in this movie..."
84,g344w16,"So who were the good guys fighting at the end? We didn’t really see these faceless villains, and I’m not sure what cause they thought they were fighting for."
85,g3ym6s5,"You know, I don’t feel like the red and blue team really helped each other out at all. 

Like it just seemed like a bunch of shit exploding at once, not people helping each other out"
86,g2zxd85,"Were I the only one that thought that the scene in the beginning at the opera could have been a Batman movie intro and Bane would enter the room? 

My main complain about this move is that I didn't understand Kats purpose. She just felt like a damsel in distress. I heard before I went to see Tenet that one of the criticism that Nolan gets is that he can't write interesting female characters. And goddamn what a boring character I thought she were, that needed to be saved by the protagonist. 

But maybe I missed something regarding her role and purpose in the movie?"
87,g2zh43s,Opinions may change on this movie if viewed with fixed audio/subtitles. I didn't really care for it but that is because I have no idea what the story even is. I couldn't make out what anybody said most of the movie. So I am hoping a future rewatch changes my mind.
88,g317z64,"Did the dialogue bother anyone else? Not just the sound, but the actual words they were saying hahah. It felt kind of stiff and responses just felt really unprompted..."
89,g346q9a,"I have a very important question...

What happens if you need to shit when you're inverted? How does defecation work in inverted time? Fire turns to ice, so does poop turn into food?"
90,g40nl1c,"Imagine how weird it would be to be shot by an inverted bullet.

One day you're fine, and then a part of your body gets bruised, then sore, and more painful, until a wound appears. And then somebody(?), I dunno, presumably the inverted medic who ""pulled it out of you"" (from his viewpoint) opens you up and carefully places the bullet ***inside your body.*** You walk around with this piece of metal inside of you, while drops of your blood are sucked up from the floor and your clothes and seep into the wound. Then an inverted shooter points a gun at you and it sucks the bullet out of you, and heals the wound instantly."
91,g2zgbno,"I just came home from it, and while watching it, I'm thinking this is a high concept movie that I need to watch again.  But after watching the movie, I have no desire to ever see this movie ever again, even if I missed out on some of the meaning behind it."
92,g2z4iuf,"Wait, I haven't followed any marketing for this outside of the first trailer. Is the main character's name seriously ""the protagonist"" or is that a joke?"
93,g3byt95,"Does Nolan know what punctuation is? I swear every single line of dialogue was just one run-on sentence, that fell out of the actors mouths at a billion miles an hour."
94,g48ng3o,"Am I too late to contribute to this thread?


Lots of this movie, I *loved*. Protagonist playing James Bond, his brutal fight scenes, acting slick? Brilliant. 

Pattinson? Just generally amazing, I'm completely sold on him.


The airport reverse sequence paying off (eventually) was really great, and I'd love to watch that again.



It's spoiled by a lot... Bad writing, convoluted, *terrible* mixing. But I'm trying to appreciate the good bits, because me and my s/o walked out thinking we genuinely did enjoy it!"
95,g8dog9n,Why aren’t we talking about the kitchen fight?! THE CHEESE GRATER!? Ow!
96,g2yumsl,Now everything I want is Robert Pattinson and Adam Driver together in a movie. I don't care how.
97,g309eh6,"I recently watched Batman Begins and was shocked at how pacey the beginning was. However, Tenet's first 30-40 minutes has been utterly butchered in the cutting room. We are left no time to breathe, and whilst this is intended throughout Tenet - the movie takes joy in ensuring our knowledge is limited - its initial acts are poorly cut.

More jarring still is the bizarre use of exposition. JDW experiences not 1, not 2, but 3 sage-like archetypes included to deliver information and drive the narrative within the first 30 minutes. A random man on a trawler, Dimple Kapadia providing wisdom and Michael Caine in a frankly bizarre scene in which a replica drawing is used as a plot device to connect the Protagonist to the Antagonist's wife. 

I cannot recall a single non-exposition-based scene in the first 30-40 minutes. We travel through the story with no sense, no emotion and effectively no ears due to the horrendous sound mixing. The film takes itself too seriously in thinking it's smart, to the extent where you stop wanting it to be. 

Tenet has a brilliant concept, it's intriguing, thought-provoking and full of intent. However you can't help wondering if there's a better film in Tenet whilst watching it. Its narrative breaks the 4th wall in wilfully challenging you to understand it. It's a demonstration that emotion and clarity are bedrocks of cinema, and neglecting either too much creates major problems.

I can't help but feel a rewatch will simply ask more questions of the mechanics and narrative. Ultimately I grow tired of plots intent on ending the world, and it feels particularly shoe horned here.

Inception and Interstellar stretched the limits of how far we are willing to open our minds to concepts. But this is because they were fine tuned and allowed time to breathe.

The execs had a clear impact on this film. Its runtime is exactly 150 minutes. I guarantee that there are 20 minutes of genuinely integral footage cut out to ensure that it falls in blockbuster territory. This, in my opinion, killed this film."
98,g2yw0uk,"I say this as the biggest Nolan fanboy, but that was absolutely terrible. Utter convoluted nonsense. I didn't care about any of the characters, and the dialogue and acting in the final scene was so awful and out of place. What a let down. 

Hopefully when I sleep on it I'll change my mind!"
99,g3b4v7f,"I caught the re-release of Inception a few weeks ago, after not having seen it since it came out, and came away impressed with how Nolan was able to communicate so many crazy ideas and plot threads in a clean and accessible way. One of his biggest flaws is clunky expositional dialogue, and Inception is certainly guilty of that at times, but I got it! I knew enough about the conceit of the movie to get what was happening, I knew what the stakes were for the characters, I cared about them achieving their goals, and the ending was satisfying and pulled it together. All the typical Nolan expositional dialogue served its purpose perfectly well, and the movie holds up great.

So here we are a decade later and he's made one of the most frustratingly convoluted movies I've ever seen. It's partially a dialogue problem (these characters talk in circles and rarely like real human beings), partially a conceptual problem (there's so fucking many wrinkles in the time-inversion conceit that it just never stops building on itself, never giving you a chance to catch up) and partially an audio problem (totally agree with everyone else; for the first time I regret watching this in IMAX because the sound was punishing and I couldn't even pick out the extremely pivotal dialogue). So you have a movie with an absurdly complicated plot that relies on you absorbing an absolute *fuckton* of dialogue, a conceit that's hard to wrap your mind around visually and narratively and a soundtrack that doesn't make those things easy. This is a bad combination.

And it's extra frustrating because I can't call it *bad*, can I? The set pieces are mostly exciting, the score (mixing aside) is great, all the performances hit their mark and there is a thrill in watching all this craziness come together. And there's something I admire in Nolan's steadfast desire to not let blockbuster audiences off easy.

But there's a difference between not holding your audience's hand and just shouting nonsense at them until they don't know what's what. By the time I got to the final battle/whatever scene I knew the goal (stop the explosion, save the world) but didn't have the slightest fucking clue what anyone was doing or where they were going. The cumulative effect was just sensory overload that completely overwhelmed any connection I could have to the emotional core of the story, or even just a basic level of ""what happens next?"" suspense.

This is a movie that simply just overcomplicates itself until it becomes a blur of noise and gunshots and explosions and at the end of the day it just boils down to ""good guy stops bad guy from destroying the world"", doesn't it? Or in other words: a lot of sound and fury, signifying nothing. Not much different from any other blockbuster movie (whether it be 007, Marvel, Michael Bay, etc.) except with a veneer of clever twist-y-ness on top of it.

I'm super happy that I was able to see a new movie in a theatre again, and I'm very happy I did, but I don't think I liked it very much."
100,g3c6em4,"This movie was a whole lot of nothing. There were some pretty awesome action sequences, but that's it. The sound design in the film was awful, dialogue was cramped with overexposition  the acting was mediocre at best. Most importantly, there was no emotional core at the center of it. Easily the worst Chris Nolan movie"
101,g30q1t8,"Man I really didn't care for anything that was going on here. The stakes just didn't feel high at all. 

There were some cool moments visually, but a lot were just concepts that desperately tried to make themselves work in a narrative sense.

I mean who were they even fighting in the desert at the end? 90% of shots were just red and blue team. They don't even try to explain the generic enemy army.

E: when the main character is doing pull ups while travelling backwards is he *losing* gains?"
102,g30stty,I think Nolan broke my eardrums.
103,g2z774r," The closest comparison is a thinking man's mission impossible.


It's a movie that doesn't make sense unless you think about it a lot. Unfortunately if you think too much it stops making sense again."
104,g2ytq6f,The kitchen scene when the greater is ripped across that guys face was brutal. I love it.
105,g308fv2,"Huge disappointment for me, here's why:

Dialogue/Characters in general - Nolan missed the mark big time for me with the dialogue for this one. The villain was VERY weak imo and not once felt intimidating at all. Also his motivations were just awful... 

Audio mix - Jeeeeez I am glad people are giving the film shit for this, some scenes weren't ***that*** bad but some, in particular the sailing scene, were an absolute joke. I seriously find it difficult to enjoy any film where I am struggling to hear a good chunk of dialogue. 

Score - The score was pretty good as is standard for Nolan, however I felt it was much too overbearing and felt out of place in quite a few scenes. 

PACING - My god the pacing in the first hour or so was very choppy and all over the place and then smoothed out towards the middle thankfully.

Action sequences - So the kitchen fight scene was great fun however that was the only action sequence I felt was enjoyable in the entire film. The corridor fight scene was just pure Hollywood fighting with cuts every 2 seconds. The final assault I felt had a lot of potential but ultimately fell flat for me, the building being shot twice was cool though. 

One nitpick - When JDW was inverted and the car exploded, this really sucked me out of the movie, so many questions. If the energy of that explosion was truly inverted and froze the car instead how tf does the protagonist survive that? We see the window freeze and the next shot is him on a table looking fine??? Come on. 

What I did like:

Performances - The acting was pretty top notch throughout even with the flakey dialogue. The villain I wasn't convinced by however. 

Visuals - Some sequences were stunning and some shots in the inverse were really cool. 

Highway Scene - Even though the explosion made no sense to me the overall sequence was great to watch, that goes for both versions."
106,g371hse,I understood and took away exactly one thing from this movie; a cheese grater to the cheek will instantly immobilize a man.
107,g3jpssx,"I want to complain about the sound mixing, but honestly I was probably the one who mixed it, but in the future"
108,g3wcv3h,"Christopher Nolan decided ""Why make a movie that 100% of the people will watch one time when you can make a move where 10% of the people watch it ten times?"""
109,g4vy05p,What?
110,g5bcx1t,"I really enjoyed the movie and will definitely be rewatching many times. However, as many others have stated, the ending fight bugged the absolute shit out of me, because you almost never see this large enemy element they're in a full on gunfight with. I say almost 'cause I feel like I remember seeing one enemy somewhere, but I could be mistaken."
111,ge045ne,"The ending climatic scene was the most impressive and boring action set piece I’ve ever seen. The cinematography was a amazing, but I have no idea why platoons of soldier are sprinting through explosions shooting at abandoned buildings."
112,gf2rfsy,"I personally feel like this is a perfect movie to debate on whether a movie needs to invoke an emotional response to be good. I liked the movie- it made me think, it was something original, which is not that common and they crashed an actual 747 into a building. What's not to like?  But at the same time, the characters were extremely bland. It's not that Nolan doesn't know how to do emotion- that scene in Interstellar when he goes through his children's old messages still gets me. I felt no connection to any of the characters, but I don't think there was intended to be any connection. I think this movie was a brilliant idea put into action, giving that idea the center stage, and in the process, ignoring any character development, and I respect that choice."
113,g2zq2rr,"I consider myself somewhat of a Nolan fanboy. I think he shits rainbows. But this movie was a mess. I didn’t know what the fuck was going on. 

Didn’t know why they were raiding the opera house, didn’t know how he came to meet Pattinson or why, didn’t know what the forged painting had to do with anything, didn’t know how the time travel shit worked, didn’t know why some guy told him about tenet and the hand gesture never to have those things mentioned again, didn’t know why there was a million soldiers running around at the end, didn’t know what the fuck was going on at any point. Also couldn’t hear a fucking word that anyone said.

And before anyone tries that “you just didn’t get it” bullshit, please. You can’t use the fact that Tenet is high concept to excuse the fact that it’s just poorly executed."
114,g2zuep2,I don't feel I understand the time travel enough in the story to give real commentary but one thing really bugged me: the characters started off with a real focus on information security so that the future antagonists couldn't send detailed information back to the present-day antagonists but by the end it's become clear that you can have multiple overlapping time travels so what does information security matter when both sides can just re-do the time slice?
115,g37izc2,"I totally understand a lot of people’s confusion with parts of the movie but I dunno I loved the whole thing, I had a fantastic time"
116,g3ik03t,Why does the protagonist suddenly want to sacrifice everything to save Kat? I really don't get the emotional connections in the movie...
117,g3mtkh8,"Nolan finally has his *""I think I went a bit too far in some places""* movie."
118,g3n9rxk,"Wow I literally have no idea what that movie was about. I know my hearing isn't as good as it used to be but I couldn't understand at least half the dialog. Maybe I need to see it again with subtitles, but I'm really disappointed."
119,g3sztsg,"Imagine watching Inception for the first time in theaters, but you have earplugs in and take a bathroom break every 10 minutes. 

That's basically Tenet."
120,g3tfcub,The loudest sound in the mix was the fucking sunscreen.
121,g3xs7fy,"Ok, so The Protagonist is gonna spend the rest of his days taking inverted shits?"
122,g42bar6,"Love
Love
Love being back in a real theatre for a big loud movie. I am not rushing here to trash or praise it, but sure was fun."
123,g4bbj2q,"I watched the movie with subtitles, and I understood the movie pretty well. As I'm used to always reading subtitles I didn't really notice the (apparently) bad soundmixing. The first half of the movie was a bit hard to follow, but that was mostly made up for the second half of the movie, where all the confusion clears up when they go through everything again. 

Definitely not Nolan's best work. It's basically just Inception (which is a great movie) with a different gimmick, less character and more confusion. I feel like they should've focused less on the romance between the Protag and Kat and more on the Protag and Neil. Neil was easily the most interesting character so the ending would've been a lot more emotional if their relationship was developed further. 7/10 for me"
124,g4fzivi,It’s all still part of the tri wizard tournament. Harry & Krum have been eliminated
125,g85e4nc,"First thoughts after leaving theater,

It was really interesting concept but still i feel like, im not sure if i enjoyed this, i didn't smile or laugh once, it was just ""oh this is interesting""

So as entertainment, not for me

If you want to get mind fucked, sure it worked


And i can admit half of the time i didn't know what was happening and i felt no emotional Connection to any character

Worth Seeing  but nothing i really want to praise"
126,gcaqrn3,"It felt like Nolan had an idea of a fight scene where one person is moving forward in time but the other is moving in reverse, and built an entire movie from that."
127,gesfjgf,"When Kat says ""You need to tell me what’s going on"" .... I felt that."
128,gex4tty,"A fascinating idea turned into a dull film. It didn't for a moment feel like something I was watching because it was fun or interesting or entertaining. Nolan seems to have gotten so lost in the sheer complexity and wunderbarness of his idea that he's let the film become a chore.

And what a terrible sound mix that was."
129,gfg3idg,"ngl, this would have been epic as a mini series. Could have taken some time to make the characters meaningful and establish motives. As a movie, it was nice to look at and experience. Made me think a little, but then there wasn't anything I could think besides how forwards/backwards influenced the scenes. Kind of felt like the protagonist died at first and was living in a dream throughout the movie; just jumping scenes everywhere."
130,gfwjuto,"That halfway point where everything clicks was so satisfying. Also, the end where Kat was revealed to be the one diving off the boat was an excellent culmination of her arc and breaking free from Sator. I will say the final act really went all in and didn’t take any breaks for the viewer. I’ll have to watch again to fully appreciate that part"
131,g2za3xs,"It was fine. The performances were all pretty solid (JDW was very charismatic, Pattinson gave a great performance and Kenneth Branagh was excellent), the soundtrack was excellent and being a Nolan movie it of course looked beautiful. It was also nice to see a Bollywood actress have a substantial role in the movie! The action sequences were great, with that classic Nolan spectacle and carried enough suspense and tension.

But oh man, Nolan definitely over-extended himself in a lot of ways. It wasn't like Inception and to a lesser extent Interstellar, where a challenging/esoteric concept was presented in a digestible manner. It honestly feels like Nolan was incapable of presenting this idea of entropy and time in a interesting way, and just resorted to poorly written exposition that didn't really do much to mitigate my confusion. Also, is it just me or is the dialogue weirdly bad for a Nolan movie? He's never been great at writing well formed characters or writing actual drama, but it really stood out here.

Also as everyone says the audio mixing was all over the place. Definitely see this movie with subtitles if it's an option at your cinema.

Overall I'm feeling a 6/10. It's competently made and  by no means is this a bad or awful movie but whatever Nolan was going for thematically in this movie, he didn't quite reach it in a comprehensible or satisfying manner."

Edit: Stop replying it's the cinema's fault. I've been going to this IMAX screen to see movies 2-3 times a month for the past several years. This is the only movie I've had this problem with. If the sound mix is designed so that you can only properly hear the dialogue in certain cinemas, it's the movie's fault!"

141,g31xkvs,"That line bugged me!  Just didn't land right , the whole world is destroyed but we are supposed to care about her so who we've seen in two fleeting shots? Excuse me but fuck your son, and fuck you for that matter 😂 

I didn't pick up on any chemistry between the protagonist and her at all, it really confused me when he started being so protective of her."

143,g36tget,Oh man that was a terrible line. Was I supposed to care?

152,g3c29vy,"That's what I was expecting, and they never came back to that. They even hinted at it with the Opera code-word halfway through. That would've been a much better ending than a shootout in a random ruin."
153,g34ihhe,"YES! It was like he was going to learn a new ""superpower"", but the rest of the movie just revolved around moving through time either forwards or backwards (which was still cool in a different way), without that ""intuition"" manipulating objects."
154,g38ayt3,"I agree with the point you are making, but he does catch the gun during the hallway fight."
155,g3cbl9b,"Basic ideas not in the movie:

* Learning to speak backwards

* Learning to move in such a way that you're undetectable in a crowd when inverted.

* Carefully avoiding dangerous inverted objects like bullet holes, car wrecks etc, or avoiding objects scattering

* Burying an inverted object for the protagonist to discover later (it's only mentioned)

* Riding inverted falling objects/debris to travel

* An object appearing to be safe then moving on its own, revealing it to be inverted.

So much else. I feel like they took a bad spy movie script and threw in a sci fi concept late in the piece."
156,g398psn,he didn't even stop eating to read his lines
157,g3t6cp4,"I know Michael Caine is very annoyed with people that do impressions of his voice, but he oddly sounded more like an exaggeration of himself than the real man when he spoke his lines."
158,g5eju1d,"He definitely seemed older (which obviously he is) the voice tends to slip down a bit and be less enunciated when we're old.

Fair enough to him, he definitely looked like he'd been wheeled out and said he'd do it if it took less than ten minutes and he could stay sitting down"
159,g3413av,"He risks everything multiple times too!
Handing over the case, saving her after she is shot in a super convuluted way...

That felt really off to me. The Protagonist is built as a cold professional, until the plot needs him not to be and commit massive 'mistakes'?"
160,g3483os,"It seemed like the better relationship to have focused on would have been the one with Robert Pattinson. That one was extremely underdeveloped but so much more interesting, especially with the knowledge that Neil has."
161,g344iry,"I think you’re meant to get the impression that he isn’t cold and professional from the Opera scene (when he picks up all the explosives to save all those people, which wasn’t part of the mission).

He also doesn’t start off caring for her and was just using her to get to Sator (lying about destroying the painting for example). 

One thing I don’t think is done well in the movie is the passing of long periods of time. When they travelled back for the final battle they would have been inverted for months, together on that boat."
162,g3abgu2,"It was so weird seeing that ‘Ukrainian opera house’ and ‘Oslo Freeport’ knowing they were both in Tallinn and then having the movie take them to Tallinn in-universe.

177,g37y9cm,"I’m with you. The movie premises that you can’t breathe normal air when in reverse. I turned to my husband and said, “so what happens when they need to take a shit?” I mean, they went back a week in time, that’s a long time to ignore basic bodily functions."
178,g3bko7n,"I could get the time inversion stuff enough but the thing I didn’t get was that they establish at one point that the inverted people sounf like they’re speaking backwards, which made it confusing how and why that played into things because I reckon people who’ve going backwards wouldn’t be able to communicate with people who are moving regularly (namely when Sator and Kat are on the boat)."

Why the f*ck is he doing this, it's never really a problem for any other filmmaker. It's getting to the point where I'm probably not going to see his next movie in the theater, it completely ruins the experience.

I really wonder, were there even test screenings for this movie? Honestly felt like it came straight from Nolan without any filter or correction suggested by test screenings. 

Very first time i got out of a Nolan movie disappointed and utterly confused, and not in the good way."
225,g32lpbt,"This reminds me of one moment that I thought could have been better edited. 

When they do the bungee jump heist there is a moment when Pattinson walks into the room with all the guards and he says ""Don't let that get cold"" as one of the guard is in the middle of a mouthful of food. It's a funny line but it passes so fast that it doesn't get the opportunity to land. I feel like just having one more beat before the line would have been much better."
226,g37vtev,There was a scene where rpat looked at the girl sleeping and then it cut to him sleeping and it was just really jarring and weird
227,g365g04,"Yes, I thought it was a mediocre film, because it felt like half the movie was missing. It was cut like an almost 3 hour long trailer. Incredibly disappointing, as there’s glimpses of something interesting in there. Probably one of Nolan’s worst movies."
228,g32lghy,"Fully agree with the first act criticism. It just felt weird and wrong, too rushed and almost as if you were running on an escalator. Straight forward with speed you don't quite feel comfortable with."
229,g3737ai,"Yeah I was thinking about this earlier. The film reminded me of Inception but done much worse. The central big gimmick thing was explained much worse, the character element that should have been the emotional core of the movie just didn't land, and the ending was ultimately unsatisfying. 

Just compare the stuff with Cobb and his wife in Inception to this stuff with Kat and her husband and son in Tenet."
230,g34iqir,"The great thing about that fight was that, the second time around, he starts out confused about how to fight himself, then later realizes he can anticipate some of his own moves. While the first time around it seems like he gets more incompetent as the fight goes on."
231,g345x3x,The brilliance of that airport scene and the vibe it gave off (mysterious time travelling soldiers) if sustained would have elevated the fill to 10/10 status. The ending concept is great too but poorly executed - I did not enjoy the desert fight scenes it looked like paintball.
232,g30vi87,"My understanding was one of the scientists (that generations Oppenheimer as they’re referred to) fears what will happen so splits it into nine parts and sends them back in time. I don’t think they actually explain how that works, or how JDW and RPatz go back a week to the Freeport scene (is there time travel or do they just invert for a week? And if the latter how do they keep Debicki alive?)

It then seems to be suggested that Branagh’s character comes across a message from the future scientists who want to activate the algorithm with instructions on how to do that. I was unsure if there was further interaction between past and future in that respect"
233,g33cpnw,"I think in one of the hard to hear scenes they said something about the future villains wanting to stop global warming or something by reversing time to before humans started polluting the earth. 

But take that with a grain of salt because I’m not sure I heard the scene correctly."

237,g34hv5m,"I feel like Inception had a comparable concept, only difference being that the plot was well-explained and relatively easy to follow. That movie makes you feel smart, while like you said, Tenet makes you feel dumb. As the writer/director, one of Nolan's jobs was to explain everything that's happening clearly, which just wasn't the case here."
238,g32ijyd,"It *is* hella complicated if you aren't crystal-clear with how inversion and the rotating doors work. There's gonna be a long-ass text post about how the whole thing works in a couple of days, I vouch it lol"
239,g32bgd4,"I genuinely feel some things did not make sense and could not make sense

For example: When driving while reversed the car is not reversed, meaning you would need to put it in reverse gear to drive it (yet they obviously don't and treat the cars reversed characters are driving as reversed themselves)

Generally the interaction of objects when one is going forwards in time and the other backwards is very weird and gimmicky. The hypothermia from the explosion felt so completely random for me for example"
240,g3b3sq9,"The 'closed time loop' always bothers me in fiction because it ultimately means that things happen without any sort of initial trigger. A character does something because they saw themselves do that thing, but there's no reason for that thing to ever happen to begin with."

249,g33yebm,"I think the general plot was easy enough to follow. It's more just the mechanics of the inversion and how it was effecting the action that was pretty confusing at times. The Protaganist versus inverted hallway fight was the only real time there felt like proper interplay between backwards and forwards. With the car chase scene it didn't seem like there was much threat from the backwards car. 

And for the finale it was hard to tell who was forwards and who was backwards. I think really it should have been solely from the point of view of the forwards team with the scene being about the ingenuous ways the backwards team was helping them. Random closeups of red and blue watches didn't really tell us much."
250,g3gdxj4,"Agree on everything.

The protagonist accepts immediately this confusing, world shattering, time travel mission just because a guy says Tenet to him?

And he knows what to do immediately, he understands inversion immediately, he doesn't report to anyone. It's just him because Tenet is so secret.

Then we realize there are hundreds of soldiers that are trained everyday with inversion, that know so much more than him, more experienced."

257,g2yyuqh,"I feel like the actor playing the protagonist had so much potential and charisma that was trying to get out, but this movie completely squandered it."
258,g2zrcck,"Pretty much all the action scenes were terrible. Mainly because the film thought that the most fun way the show the inversion stuff was with guns and explosions. But after watching it I think a smaller approach would've worked way better. The last battle was especially bad. I love battle scenes, even bad ones are usually fun but this one was completely terrible. It was impossible to understand what was happening, where the enemies were and who they were shooting at. Plus it mainly consisted of them running while shit was exploding around them, then they take cover and shoot an enemy and then they run again. This happened over and over again for 20 minutes. They should use this scene in filmschools to teach people how not to shoot and edit an action sequence. This scene should've been more like the Oslo scene, smaller scale and about them using the inversion idea in an interesting way."

They were there to extract a guy with a container of ""plutonium"" - actually a part of the Algorithm.

As far as Protag knew, he was introduced to Pattinson simply as a local agent that could help get him to Pria('s husband). Pattinson had met protag years before, in his past and Protag's future.

> didn’t know what the forged painting had to do with anything

It was literally just an item that was being used to blackmail Kat, it had nothing to do with the Tenet organisation.

> didn’t know how the time travel shit worked

You get flipped, you experience time backwards. I don't think there's much to explain here, I thought seeing it action explained it well enough.

> didn’t know why some guy told him about tenet and the hand gesture never to have those things mentioned again

It was mentioned all over the place. Protag said his name was John Tenet (or something like that) and got to speak to the inversion scientist. Pria mentioned the tenets that her husband lives by, in order to get Protag to let him go and Protag said it to her when he spoke to her earlier in her timeline."

At the end of the movie, his new understanding of the implication of time inversion is that since ""whatever's happened, happened"", he can believe that the world will be saved (because  time as we know it obviously still exists), and can choose to save it in a manner that aligns with his morals and beliefs."
322,g3aembz,"This. The only reason I think the whole Kat subplot was added was because there had to be some emotional element, but once again Nolan can only develop a character based on their relationship to a female with a tragic story.

I think had Nolan fully developed on the backstories of the Protagonist and Neil, who already have an amazing chemistry, it would have not only given the film a stronger and concise human angle, but also freed up so much more time to actually develop the film's plot and concept, as well create a more memorable antagonist.

A cohesive time travel thriller supported by a story about friendship between two insanely charismatic leads would have personally been much better than the polarising mess we got."

Although seriously, I feel like they could have done something better like showing him genuinely care for the son (instead of just wanting to spite her) and then have her genuinely surprised that he'd kill the son, but instead they just reminded her that her entire character is an incredibly bland `""I care about my son""`

I was hoping after the part at the beginning over whether or not he'd hold a child or a woman hostage would be brought up, but it wasn't. Felt like foreshadowing that never went anywhere. Also the ""...opening the wrong doors"" warning. Was hoping he'd accidentally reveal himself to the bad guys at one point."

Half of Kenneth Branagh's whispered monologue at the end is heard through a phone's shitty loudspeaker in the middle of the final action setpiece, I mean what the fuck."
349,g30kj7n,All the boat scenes were goddamn annoying
350,g34053e,I laughed so hard at that scene. It felt like Nolan heard criticisms of dialogue being unable to be heard so he set what could have been a dinner conversation on a loud ass boat.
351,g2zb8sa,Movie would probably make more sense if you just put it on mute.
352,g33rk52,Long time Nolan fan here and I have to say I’m with you. It’s becoming a giant turnoff. Rewatching certain movies of his at home is so annoying because I feel like I have to have my remote on standby in order to turn volume up and down throughout a 2.5 hour movie. The audio mixing in his movies since TDKR has been utterly horrendous.
353,g35fwf8,"It wasn't bothersome in dunkirk because we all know what's going on. In a plot heavy movie like this it's a total nightmare, most of the exposition is lost"

356,g2zwg3t,">This is just one small problem. Others are: Where did The Protagonist come from? What was the objective of the climactic battle, and who were they fighting? If the Protagonist became inverted in time, how could he interact with non-inverted people like Neil, and speak to him without his voice being reversed?

They were guarding the place, it was the place where all the other pieces had been stored so far and they were bringing the last one for the end of the world."
357,g303mm0,"I might have liked the dialogue if I could have understood half of it. The Indian woman (Priya?), the bearded officer in the helmet, they key moment in the middle of the film where a key character was shot, and the entire final phone conversation between the villain and protagonist were most unintelligible thanks to awful sound mixing.

Even so the story was fairly easy to follow just on the visual sense, the overall direction was really creative, and the acting with Washington, Debicki, and Patterson was great. Was not Nolan's best film by a far shot, but not awful either.

Although I still can't believe the final climax of the movie >!wasn't in the opera house!<"

360,g3fz3ni,"""if i cant have it, no one can"" in repeat. That was the whole character.   
I was annoyed because Branagh can bring lot out of even badly written character, this was just boring.   


Actually the character and most of the movie would have been more interesting if he had confessed to protagonist that when he found the first loot box from future, the papers had name of the other guy that he was working with and thats why he killed him.   
He had allready changed the future!

367,g382erm,Exactly what I've been thinking as well. Inception & Tenet make for interesting companion pieces but ultimately become more of a study of how to do a film like this and how not to do a film like this.
368,g3fdybj,"Exactly and that's what the film needed more of. Those kinds of details and set pieces where you can actually follow what's happening, have questions and then have them answered shortly after with great twists and surprises. That airport sequence and maybe the highway sequence were the best parts because you could follow the 'inversion', unlike that 'climatic' final battle scene"
369,g3w1uqr,"> I did not enjoy the desert fight scenes it looked like paintball.

Exactly!! It was just a dumb paintball scene!! So frustrating..

They should've explained the 'temporal pincer movement' better and just do it with 2-3 people and a kind of heist. It wouldve been perfect..

Now it was just wait what are they actually fighting? I didn't understand anything of it ... so badd"
370,g310mdp,"> is there time travel or do they just invert for a week? And if the latter how do they keep Debicki alive?)

They invert for a week from what I understood and then more to get to the final battle (taking place on the same day as the opera attack from the start). They keep her alive by healing her normally. She couldn't stay in the normal timeline because she was shot with an inverted bullet but in the inverted timeline, the bullet is just normal so they can heal her"
371,g31mig6,It’s basically your basic bond film. Hell this is even more of a satire considering how hammy Kenneth Branagh was with his acting. This performace was even worst than murder on the orient express
372,g3cvxrz,"That’s called the bootstrap paradox. An information being sent back in time and it triggers even to the point in the future that the information goes back in time.

375,g2z9qnc,Even “half the movie” is an understatement.
376,g2zwssv,"Nolan has specifically stated he intentionally muffles the sound mixing because for him the dialogue is not important except as a part of the emotional backdrop of the film; i.e., letting the sound effects and score overwhelm the speaking in order to get the emotional effect he desires.

I think that's a very unwise decision, imho, but it's not a case of failure or something being screwed up; it's a very intentional choice."
377,g2yx3cd,"There have been sound mixing issues with most of the recent Nolan movies that get amplified if you watch it in IMAX. I remember when I first watched Interstellar it was in a regular cinema, and I could hear all the dialogue. However, I recently rewatched it in my local IMAX for the re-release and there are a few scenes where dialogue is hard to hear because of the sound mixing. However, for Interstellar, that was 3-4 scenes tops (off the top of my head the scene where they chase the Indian drone is pretty bad, and then when Michael Caine is dying). With Dunkirk it was probably something at least 30% of the dialogue was hard to make out, because of the sound mixing, and not just in IMAX. I feel like with Tenet it's even worse!"

388,g2zup9o,This is the crux of the main issue with the movie: the time inversion action scenes sounded a lot cooler on paper then they actually look on screen.

The second half fell flat for me.

421,g316xlb,"I mean not really, not sure what you mean by ""a lot"". 

Either way, this was THE movie for it to happen. Instead we got a mess of a ""grand"" final act, with generic soliders shooting at generic goons (the few times we actually saw any), in a very generic set piece (ruined and abandoned Soviet city). The time-inverse gimmick wasn't even used that much at all, besides the building exploding which was neat, and random soldiers walking backwards every once in a while in the background.   
Also, Nolan just can't really tackle these big war-like action scenes. It felt very DKRises to me, with the difference that these weren't unarmed cops, but highly trained and weaponized special operatives that just ran in droves without any semblance of proper tactics whatsoever. 

Having it end at the Opera could have worked way better, considering the very unique setting, the smaller scale and the possilbity of doing way more cool stuff with time shenanigans."
422,g3xjtxe,I don't blame you. That first 20 minutes of the movie is edited in a super disorienting fashion and it just throws raw information at you that's super dense but also leaves out so much. It was hard to keep track of what was going on and when you finally caught up it'd just hard cut to him talking to a new random person on the other side of the world.
423,g6ynepf,"He should, would have been more fun."
424,g3ojrtd,"But that's his own molecules being inverted. Which is different from whatever they were talking there where they could apparently control inverted objects with ""instinct""."
425,g346zgc,"The point of her as an innocent bystander is not that she has to prove that common people are ""useful"" to the mission. Rather, common people getting to live their life according to their ""innocent""/""good""/""just"" values is the point. Her suppressing herself for the greater good of the mission is what the members of the espionage world who ""live in a twilight world"" do, but that's a self-sacrifice they do precisely so that we don't have to.

She ""endangers the mission"" in that she endangers their backup plan, but to quote Rick from Rick and Morty, that's ""planning for failure"". The development the Protagonist goes through in the movie is that he fully becomes ""the Protagonist"", i.e. the champion of his cause and beliefs, by ""choosing"" to believe in his own success."
426,g3bsw52,Reading this and wishing this was the movie I'd watched. If they spent more time with Neil dropping stories about other things he did only to later find out it was all with The Protagonist would really help the ending instead of leaving to us to imagine what kind of things they get up to. Also could have maybe had him explain the whole tenet organization or whatever it is.

I think the people from the future had lost the algorithm to invert time so his plan was to retrieve it for them then hide it at the bottom of the shaft. When he dies, the bomb goes off and then seals it in place. At some point in the future, the future humans find it and then use the algorithm to end the world. However since the protagonists stopped the algorithm from being sealed in the tube, the future humans never found it and as such life goes on."

471,g3etusl,"You are quite right that they would need to take their waste back with them through the portal once the revert themselves back to normal time. If they leave their reverted shits they would just keep going back in time, meaning that at any point in the past there would have been this shit just waiting for the moment in the future to get unshat into the person that produced it.

Should be simple enough though, just throw all waste into the machine, get it inverted into regular shits and food waste and get it taken care of normally after that. All I'm saying is that the logistics sort of work out if one makes the effort :D"

473,g301hon,Distraction from who? You don't even see any enemy personnel in the final battle sequence lol
474,g36npsw,"Yes but only for a few weeks until her younger self gets inverted. 

Wait actually there are three versions of her but one is in a container traveling backwards in time"
475,g3fontc,"Yeah they had a nice chemistry, I hope they do films together in the future."
476,g3omrbn,Felix Leiter
477,g37547j,They couldn't get explosives or anything to make a fire through airport security (he mumbled something to that effect).
478,g37l95w,"So Congratulations, you got yourself replied to. What's the next step of your master meme?"
479,g3gf5bw,"Lol 

There's this amazing sequence and we still don't know what happened. Who saved who."
480,g38uxsq,"But even if it does get sealed, the protagonist and his organization presumably has like 50 years to dig it back up again before the future people get it?"
481,g32irv3,"Nope. The algorithm would be activated immediately after Branaugh's death. That's what the story about Oppenheimer referred too.

The future world is ruined due to the way we (the present) have treated the planet. Since their world is fucked they decide to roll the dice and let the algorithm be activated in their past (our present). It will kill everything on earth and two things can happen (the grandpa paradox): their world will be destroyed too (they all die because they have no ancestors anymore) or their timeline will remain but the world a better place because people in the last died and couldn't ruin the planet anymore. Given the ruined state of their world, they are willing to take that risk

Branaugh is a selfless piece of shit (which he proved earlier with his wife already). His whole world revolves around him. So if he can't live en enjoy the world anymore, why should we?"
482,g30abvr,"Exactly, which is ""showing not telling"" which is exactly what the movie needed more of. Especially since the sound mixing was so bad."
483,g3jcdr7,We all are. Act accordingly.
484,g6spdp2,Robert Pattinson and JDW has way better chemistry than the blonde woman
485,g31cft6,"Yep. The ""plutonium"" from the Opera house, which was actually one of the 9, could've become at the very end the actual last of the 9 that they had to prevent from being taken. It would have thematically made the movie have much more sense.

We also had the mysterious soldier that saved JDW at the start already setup as the big reveal that it was Neil all along. Instead, we're just forced to connect the dots at the end and realize that it was him at the start too, without ever having revisisted that part. That was just way more disappointing.

THe best parts of this movie for me, were those that revisited what we had already seen, a second time from a different POV: the airplane scene, the highway chase. Closing it off with an epic revisitation of the Opera House would have been an amazing payoff. Instead, we got an extremely generic ""epic"" final battle that at times reminded me of Starship Troopers...

What a really big missed opportunity for doing something really cool."
486,g3gbneb,"It was supposed to be Sartor's militia or paid mercenaries, defending the compound. We were told they had both regular and inverted soldiers as well. However, besides the Russian henchman they fight at the bombsite, i think we saw like 2 or 3 at most?

Both red and blue team were composed by a lot of soldiers, so we're left to just assume there were a lot of bad guys there. We just never saw any pretty much. Just the good guys shooting a lot at a lot of stuff and a lot of random explosions."
487,g32zyjw,There's a bunch of dudes in white camo.
488,g36kagz,How is the algorithm going to be activated? He’s literally detonating a bomb to bury all 9 pieces that contain the algorithm. The people in the future want to invert time from their perspective so they can live on in reverse. They’re too selfish to let their own timeline get destroyed.
489,g30apjb,"You see it before when he's driving the truck and honking at the protagonist too, but I guess of all things Nolan wanted to make his bag super obvious. If only he did that throughout the entire movie like Inception there wouldn't be as many questions left unanswered."
490,g4lpmxs,Including my son
491,g3jq3e0,I.... I'm dying? 😳😳
492,g35q90k,"Something tells me the opera was supposed to be the final scene, but someone wanted to incorporate more of an emotional angle to things. I feel like the emotional side of this movie was really weak, but I really loved the action. They should have just unapologetically leaned into action."
493,g324c1x,I’m so with you. It was an epic action movie but it felt like it was building up to a payoff that never came
494,g32hlt2,"Some things will dawn at you later, or with a second viewing. Like the scene where The Protagonist and Neil meet.

Neil knows that the Protagonist doesn't drink on the job and wants a diet coke. Both the viewer and The Protagonist are impressed by his knowledge. 

Looking back, we find out Neil has known the Protagonist for years in his life / timeline. So he was actually ordering a drink for a good friend.

In the end the films isn't that complex, it just looks like it at first glance. Looking back, you can piece together all the pieces and it's a pretty straightforward story."
495,g3jv4m3,Yeah. Your moves are weak.
496,g3gbdi9,Nolan wrote the script so he thought that

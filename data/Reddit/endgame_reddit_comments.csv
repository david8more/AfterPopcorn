1,eltdkss,"At this point, the Tesseract should be an honorary Avenger. Been in more movies than Clint"
2,elt8rj1,Even the Avengers needed a recap of Thor 2
3,eltqw10,Shout out to Starlord's karaoke dancing. I never thought about how awkward it would be to watch him dance through the barren planet without the backing track.
4,eltfyhh,I felt pain when Antman’s taco blew away. Hulk the MVP for the taco hook ups. When EVERYONE pulled up though I was so stoked.
5,eltx7q6,"I've always aspired to get the Chris Hemsworth as Thor physique, this movie had shown me that it's possible."
6,eltfupp,"So when cap went back to vormir  with the soul stone, did he have an awkward meeting with red skull?"
7,elsyjee,"I expected Tony and Steve to be out after this one, but not Nat. Did not expect that one."
8,elt1aqp,At least one thing I didnt expect to see: Thanos wearing a T-Shirt.
9,elsytft,Did anyone predict Thanos would be beheaded 10 minutes into the movie lol.
10,eludksx,"Imagine the threads on r/relationships after all the snapped people come back

""I [32m] lost my girlfriend [27f???] in the vanishing 5 years ago, am now married to a wonderful woman [31f] who also lost her boyfriend [28m???] at the same time, and they've now both reappeared in our lives like nothing has happened. When would be the right time to suggest a foursome?"""
11,elu1x1i,"When Carol is keeping new thanos from snapping, so he pulls the power stone just to knock her off: 1000 IQ play."
12,eltg30s,"The best spoiler with no context is: ""I loved it when The Hulk gave Ant-Man a new taco"""
13,elti5a4,Professor Hulk eating his own flavour of Ben and Jerry’s ice cream mentioned in Infinity War (Hulka-Hunka Burning Fudge)
14,elvl6nv,"If you woulda told me a few years ago that Captain America would throw Fat Thor’s hammer through the air for Spidey to swing on to a flying unicorn with so that he could get the Infinity Gauntlet to Ant-Man’s time traveling minivan, I would have told you to go fuck yourself."
15,eltjjx6,"Rocket: ""When Thanos snapped his fingers, Earth became ground zero for a power surge of ridiculously cosmic proportions...""

This sounds like a new plot point for new super individuals!"
16,elt7lyk,Captain America saying Hail Hydra was easily one of my favorite scenes in the entire movie.
17,elteklr,"I loved when they show starlord’s intro scene from GOTG with the music, but then cut to them watching him and hearing him singing in the background. 
I always just pictured him lip-syncing to it and not actually singing along. That was hilarious."
18,elt1eg0,"Thor decapitating Thanos like 20 minutes into the movie was something I certainly was not expecting to say the least

Numerous gasps throughout the theatre for that one"
19,elsy0rk,The hug Tony gave his father really got me. Also how cool was it to see Jarvis?
20,elu8uc1,[deleted]
21,eltggys,"Easter eggs/References:

* New Asgard is in the same place that Odin gave his big speech and died in Thor: Ragnarok
* The female superheroes teaming up is a reference to the A-Force comics
* On the Vanishing Memorial,  the name of an X-men character is mentioned: Roberto da Costa / Sunspot. The character is a part of the New Mutants and X-Force, both of which are getting movies. 
* When Captain America and Iron Man travel back to 1970, Arnim Zola's voice is heard off-screen
* Harley from Iron Man 3 at Iron Man's funeral

&#x200B;

Are there any more?"
22,elszxlu,Lol Thanos beat Hulk’s ass so bad in Infinity War he made Hulk and Banner get along.
23,elt0x3s,Holy shit the amount of hype in the theatre when Captain America picked up Thor's hammer
24,elte92x,"Scott Lang saved the universe, but don't let that distract you from the fact that he thought Die Hard had time-travel in it."
25,elt4gxa,Paul Rudd was on fire that whole movie
26,elt2k94,"One thing I haven't seen anyone mention is how well these events tie up to *Dr. Strange*.  

Strange was afraid of failure, but was then taught by the Ancient One that sometimes to succeed, you must fail. This is the final thing she taught him before her death.  Dr. Strange willingly gave up the Time Stone in *Infinity War*, making our heroes ""lose"", but this failure would later prove to be necessary for them to win. 

Once Bruce tells the Ancient One that Strange willingly gave up the Time Stone, she realized she was successful in preparing Dr. Strange, given their final conversation/lesson."
27,eltlguj,Went straight to the Audi dealership after
28,eltfot8,"**Beginning of the movie:**   
Pepper asked Tony if he could even rest if he hid his findings for the Time Heist.

&#x200B;

**The end of the movie:**   
Pepper told Tony that he can now rest.

&#x200B;

:("
29,elt3mzs,"Here we go!  They're going to recreate the elevator scene...how are they going to top that train wreck on steroids?? 

Hail Hydra"
30,elsxz84,"""Step Aside Lebowski.""

Drax said he wasn't a dude, Tony Stark thought he was THE dude."
31,elszmpr,"The hug by Tony that he gives Peter. 
Instantly remembered their scene together from Homecoming when he leans over to open the car door and peter thinks it’s a hug and Tony tells him it’s not.  That hit hard."
32,elteyac,"Honestly, even with the level of secrecy around this film, I'm still amazed they managed to keep fat bogan Thor a secret. Chris Hemsworth must have been having a field day posting his workout videos online."
33,elszvqj,"I really liked the way they did the final credits, building up to the core 6, with their autographs and actual footage of them rather than a stylistic rendering (which I like in the other films, but appreciate what they did here)."
34,elub8oe, I love that Iron man was able to flick ant-man perfectly because of all his practice playing paper football with Nebula
35,eltkkjc,"Thanos: I am.... Inevitable.

Tony: I am.... Iron Man.

Fucking incredible."
36,elsy1s8,"So, Thor’s gonna be in Guardians Vol. 3? I’m down."
37,elt24xh,It’s nice that Hawkeye kept his wife’s cell phone number active for five years after she died.
38,eltbshr,"Thor's line ""I'm still worthy"" absolutely wrecked me...you could hear it in his delivery"
39,eltb2ng,"""I'm sorry Tony, it's the only way"" takes on a whole new meaning now."
40,eltgfvv,Must've been the most bizarre day from Thanos' POV. Dude just wanted to do some bonding with his daughters ended up getting into the battle of his life with people he doesn't even know yet.
41,elt79yg,"If youre like me and couldn't figure out who the kid was in the funeral procession, he was the kid from Iron Man 3 who helps Tony fix his suit.

Edit: obligatory thank you for my first Reddit silver!
Edit2: First gold! Thank you stranger :)"
42,elt8rqo,I'm glad I can finally say I have a body like a Norse god
43,elt7kil,"I can't believe of all the moments in this movie, the thing that sticks out in my mind is Thor and his mother. That entire scene was beautifully done. Perfect amount of heart and humor."
44,elt0svi,Think of all the awkward conversations of someone poofing back to life only to find their husband/wife had remarried in the past 5 years.
45,elsy8ft,Shoutout to the rat who saved the universe.
46,eltfo21,Let's be real most important spoiler is the hulk dab
47,elt8zz3,I like how Thor is much easier to cosplay for many of us now.
48,elszxke,"Dr. Strange signaling the ""1"" to Tony to indicate they were on the path for the 1 chance still was great"
49,elt4ju5,"Hands down, I loved it when they killed Thanos that early on. It literally left everything in the open and you really can't predict what's going to happen next. It's so rare for movies to do this and they did it wonderfully. Thank you for all these years of adventure, MCU."
50,eltd644,"How fucking EPIC was Steve standing alone versus Thanos and his forces?

That shot was just beautiful, the whole movie is packed with them. It's a goldmine for desktop backgrounds for years to come."
51,elsz48w,"I just wanted Cap to have a happy ending. I didn’t expect them to give Cap the happiest fucking ending in the world. That shit brought me to tears, along with the passing of the shield.

Here’s to new adventures with Captain Falcon!"
52,elsxs1h,"One bit of trivia I just realized today:

Each of the main OG Avengers (Iron Man, Cap, and Thor) has their most critically acclaimed director appear in Endgame, in scenes with their respective Avenger.

Jon Favreau as Happy, Joe Russo as the guy mourning the loss of his partner with Cap, and Taika Waititi as Korg.

I thought Favreau's appearance was especially poignant, as the director that started it all, and who found the perfect actor to carry the franchise in RDJ.  How fitting that he's at Tony's sendoff, taking care of his legacy.

&#x200B;

Another amazing cameo: Jarvis from Agent Carter, which I believe is the first appearance of a character originating from any of the TV shows in the movies.  Correct me if I'm wrong.

&#x200B;

EDIT:

As u/piazza and u/TheW1ldcard pointed out, the group therapy scene with Russo also featured a cameo by Jim Starlin, the writer/artist responsible for creating Thanos, Gamora and Drax, as well as the upcoming Shang-Chi (co-creator).

&#x200B;

In line with this, others in this thread have commented on the duality of Iron Man and Thanos in the last two movies (two sides of the same coin, whatever it takes, etc.), so the fact that their respective creators appeared in this movie continues that symmetry quite nicely, I think."
53,elsxng2,"**Hail Hydra.**
 
No more elevator fights, just Cap trolling! It really shows how much he's grown from his past self."
54,elt1is5,"I liked how the shot of defeated Thanos paralleled the ending shot of Infinity War, only now he's surrounded by his disappearing army, not a paradise."
55,eltf137,I guess the CEO of Audi didn't get dusted.
56,elsxo5m,"I love how the Ancient One, without missing a beat, is just causally like ""Oh, Steven Strange? That guy that takes my job five years into the future that I haven't met yet? Not here."" That was a nice touch.

She then goes on to do a very MCU version of Doc Brown's *chalk*board to explain branching timelines for the audience.

Edit: I have been reminded Doc Brown used a chalkboard and not a whiteboard, as whiteboards weren't a thing in the 80s. I want to apologize deeply and sincerely to everyone involved with Back to the Future Part 2."
57,elsy5bm,The *Hail Hydra* scene was by far my favorite moment
58,elsyjxc,"Totally different than what I was expecting, in the best possible way"
59,elsyap7,Spidey hugs Tony and out come the fuckin waterworks
60,elsyoyx,"I haven’t seen anyone mention it, but Marvel may have been planting a seed for Atlantis (and Namor)vs. Wakanda. Okoye tells Natasha there is an earthquake in the ocean during the meeting 5 years after the snap."
61,elt6end,"I really appreciated that for the bulk of this movie the story was actually quite simple and straightforward.  The story and characters really benefitted from the much smaller cast through the first and second act. I  felt like I connected to the characters this time better than I have in any Marvel film since Winter Soldier and the first Guardians film because of the added time the movie was able to spend with them. 

Ultimately I thought this movie managed to walk a tight rope really, really well. It managed to subvert expectations early on with what they do to Thanos and the Stones, making what is ultimately a fairly predictable outcome into a more unique than expected journey. I like that the Avengers have to plan and strategize and really rely on their intelligence to win, rather than *just* punching and shooting a lot. 

I also would just like to say that this movie was a very bittersweet send off for the two pillars of this franchise; Tony Stark and Steve Rogers. It seemed inevitable what would ultimately happen with Tony, but I didnt see the ending for Cap coming and found it strangely satisfying. If we have to lose these characters the actors couldn't have asked for more better closure with their exits. Especially Robert Downey Jr., who puts in his best Tony Stark performance in years."
62,elsxr9m,That battle tho. Absolutely crushed. Thank you RDJ
63,elsyig5,"I'm so happy we got to see Scarlet Witch be a complete boss.

Such an amazing set up in the beginning of the movie with Hawkeye.

Great payoff to Cap almost picking the hammer up in Age of Ultron"
64,elsxpcp,That *is* America's ass.
65,elt702n,"I know ScarJo hasn't always had a lot to do in the MCU, but she killed it in the first half of this movie. She looked like someone who was shouldering the responsibility of the world (and part of the Galaxy) and had just been wrecked for five years. She was missed in the end battle, but she went out like a boss."
66,elsyv3s,"May I introduce Thor of House Baratheon, the God of Thunder, with a body like bobby."
67,elszkft,Cap put up a fucking fight. My man. Stole Thor's thunder. Literally.
68,elt64f3,Paul Rudd probably my MVP of the movie after the big 3 he was great
69,eltbjr1,"*Jesus*, Thanos was fucking relentless! I couldn’t believe how close he came with all of them there fighting him off. 

That move where he pulls the power stone to finally overcome Cap Marvel, was epic as shit!"
70,elsxu08,"*Carol Danver has entered movie*



*Carol Danver has left movie*"
71,elt328m,"Surely Wanda ranks as the most powerful avenger? She managed to hold off thanos with one hand for a few moment s while having to kill the love of her life with the other.  And now here, with her full attention and rage, she was about to absolutely dismantle him."
72,elsynzm,I love how everyone spent a whole year theorizing on how they were gonna take Thanos down and they just decided to pull up and clap his cheeks while he was chilling
73,elu0dzr,"That clip of Captain America standing along in front of Thanos and his entire army was so beautiful. It just showed you what Cap was willing to do. Whether he had anyone or not to help him, he was gonna do whatever it takes to beat him. The way they clipped that was amazing."
74,elsywoh,[deleted]
75,elt00lj,Tony really misread Dr. Strange's command to send Antman up Thanos' butt.
76,eltfpnd,man that guy who played War Machine in the first Iron Man movie must be kickin himself right now
77,eltm6cp,"Guys, search ""Thanos"" on Google and click the Infinity Gauntlet. You won't be disappointed."

79,eltf7lj,"They did Star Lord's dance without music, ""On your left"" was brought back. This movie was like Marvel's past, present, and future happening at once."
80,elt02dt,holy shit GOTG3 directed by James Gunn plus Thor will be legendary
81,eltce5v,"So peter is 5 years in the future and he’s like, “Hey, I still have to finish high school.”"
82,elti3d6,"My favorite part of Endgame is Nebula, both of them, or just all of them.  She was my least favorite character in Guardians.  The opening scene got me thinking, ""OK.  This is really good.  She's funny.  The intense straight act to Tony's laid back, sarcastic antics.""  As the story progressed I was completely immersed in her character.  It truly felt like we were seeing two different versions of the same Nebula struggling to succeed.  Overall, it was just a brilliant choice by the writers and incredible acting."
83,elsy95v,"Tony saying “I lost the kid” at the beginning, Peter and Pepper talking to Tony as he dies, “I love you 3000” in the hologram, the cheeseburgers. Holy shit man"
84,elsxmvv,"With Steve finally getting his dance with Peggy, (fully) saying ""Avengers assemble"", being worthy to wield Mjolnir, and living a full peaceful life, I'm 100% satisfied with his ending. I've been waiting so long for him to get that dance.

I'm so glad the movies finally referenced the shows by having a Jarvis cameo. I never thought the day would come

Finally, Fat Thor cultivated SO MUCH MASS"
85,elsyd9r,My theater went insane when Cap caught the hammer. Finally worthy.
86,elt72cg,Wong you’re invited to my Funeral
87,elsxpjq,"Korg and M’Baku in the same movie!

**Glory to Hanuman**

Just missing Luis for the trinity."
88,elu2jkx,"Peter.  Peter..  Peter, that's nice, I'm glad you're..PETER GET THE FUCK OUT OF THE WAY THAT'S MY HUSBAND"
89,elt72ll,"Man, I feel sorry for Quill - it's great that he got a Gamora back, but wow is it harsh to see someone he loved that doesn't even know who he is."
90,elsyf9o,I am pumped for Asgardians of the Galaxy! Thor is going to fit in perfectly with those guys!!
91,eltf4wn,"I have my share of misgivings with the movie, but then I'll just randomly remember a scene like giant Ant Man punching a fucking Chitauri Leviathan in the face and smile."
92,elsxmrk,poor thanos just wanted to farm :(
93,eltz3qb,"I love how the movie can effectively be grouped into three parts:  the aftermath of IW, an absolute love-letter to the past 10 years of the MCU, and the final battle that may be one of the most satisfying in cinema history."
94,elt4ht1,Cap laying the hammer down was the culmination of this entire saga. That was the most badass thing I have ever witnessed.
95,eltm9qw,"14,000,605 probabilities.  And it all came down to a rat, the true saviour."
96,elsyh06,"“I can do this all day” “yeah yeah, I know”
 
*shout out u/notanothercirclejerk on the correction"
97,elsxsjt,"When Thor showed up on screen, a little kid in my theatre exclaimed “SO FAT!” The kid was otherwise quiet throughout the film, but I guess at that moment he (she?) just couldn’t help himself lol. 

Btw, I liked how Cap spoiled the Bucky plot for himself."
98,elsxzm6,The whole third act will probably be the hypest shit I'll ever see in my life
99,elti4d8,"Natasha dying really suprised me, I thought with upcoming black widow movie and rumors of clints daughter taking his mantel it would be him"
100,elsyqbt,The last hour of the movie was just everything a marvel fan could’ve hoped for. Absolutely epic and brilliant.
101,elu94t1,"When Tony was dying and Peter was telling him they won I found Pepper's consoling hands inadvertently funny, almost like she wasn't consoling Peter but gently telling him *""Ok Peter I know you're upset but I'm his wife so please move aside now and let me have a moment before he dies.""*"
102,elsxmhg,"I

**AM**

#IRON MAN

Such an emotional and well rewarded end to his character. Robert Downey Jr. has been phenomenal for these 11 years as Tony Stark. A poetic climax; The MCU started with Iron Man in 2008 and ended (*this trilogy of phases*) with him saving it. At his own expense, mirroring Thanos he can ""*Finally rest. To a grateful universe*."""
103,elt2or1,"Super satisfying, particularly the character arcs of Iron Man and Cap.   Most self-centered asshole in the world => sacrifices everything for humanity, selfless paragon => finally gives himself a break to be human.  10/10 with rice."
104,elttkfl,I just like the fact that you can tell people that thor gets really fat and becomes a fortnite gamer and hulk dabs and they'll assume you're talking shit.
105,elt9nvd,"i realized while showering, that all the people who moved on from grieving their loved ones, a lot of them got remarried or found new partners, now have to deal with a situation where their original significant other comes back... yikes."
106,elt3dtf,I almost cried when the Portals opened and all the previously dead characters came out. Such an awesome moment felt so glorious.
107,elsyjsf,"Can we get a movie or tv series about Thor, Korg, and Miek hanging out?"
108,elsymbn,"I really wished Tony would get away and retire and finally rest happy with his family and remain a sort of a mentor figure, it was the only one I hoped would get away, didn't expect him to do what I thought Cap would do and vice-versa, either way, a fantastic movie but I think the MCU will feel emptier for me without Robert."
109,eltodji,"So to return the stones, did Cap have to go to Asgard and stick the probe back into Jane?"
110,elsxmwx,"It’s a testament to everyone involved in this movie that a three-hour film with more than two dozen heroes somehow never felt bloated. What a decade it’s been. 

Some callbacks/payoffs from previous MCU movies I can recall while I’m still swimming in my feelings:

- “I am Iron Man.”
- T’Chala remembering Clint’s name
- Spider-Man’s “Insta-kill mode”
- Falcon’s “on your left” to Cap
- Black Widow and Hawkeye referencing Budapest

I know there are others but I need time to process lol

Edit: The “cheeseburgers” at Tony’s funeral........“Avengers, assemble.”........CAP PICKING UP THOR'S HAMMER AND PUSHING IN THANOS' SHIT WITH IT........The reference to Cap's fight scene in the elevator"
111,eltfl0n,Howard tells to Tony that he is afraid his son would turn out like him - someone who values self interest more than greater good. Sobs! Proud of you mah man. Sobs!
112,elszmw8,"I had such high expectations and this movie still somehow surpassed them

It’s surreal to see the end after a decade of these movies, Stan Lee would’ve been so proud to see the culmination of his hard work"
113,elt91ky,"Cap going apeshit with Mjolnir was what I was waiting 10 years for, Also bloodlust (no more mutants) Scarlett Witch were definitely my favorite bits of the final battle it was great seeing her be more in line with her comic power level"
114,elu9n4l,Fat Thor gonna be the the Harley Quinn of Halloween costumes for men this year
115,elsyfao,[deleted]
116,eltva81,The real hero of the movie was the rat who brought back Ant-Man.
117,eltxkfl,It was alll ok till Stark says I love you 3000 in his hologram tape.
118,elty9h2,"I can't believe I haven't seen any comments about Hulk in the stairs. That might be my favourite Hulk moment ever.

""AHHHHHHH!!! SO MANY STAIRS!!!!!!!"""
119,elsxu8i,"The first casualty of endgame: Steve Roger's beard.  

&#x200B;

Also, that scene where Natasha and Clint were fighting to sacrifice themselves was incredible"
120,elt0s0y,It’s a bad week to be a Stark
121,elsxmlc,Thought I was done crying then they mentioned Cheeseburgers.
122,eltix6w,hol up that scene of widow doing shooting practice wasnt even in the movie
123,eltbxra,"Tony's discussion with Howard was one of the most poignant moments for me. Tony has spent his entire life in complicated grief because he looked up to his father but he never truly felt the love from him. Between the sudden death, later finding out it was an assassination, wanting to obviously love your father but feeling like he was cold and had no time for you, that conversation was unreal.

It must have meant the world to Tony to see that Howard was obviously nervous about being a father and screwing up, especially after Howard's own father reverted to the belt. Cannot deny that my little heart friggin swelled at Tony's reaction to Howard saying, ""I don't even know the little guy but I'd do anything for him."""
124,eltas3g,I would watch a Hawkeye Cyberpunk Neo Tokyo assassin film.
125,elsz957,"There’s something so magical about seeing an Avengers movie opening night with a packed crowd. Laughing, crying, cheering. It’s something else. Glad I could be here for this one."
126,elt6n27,"Loved the movie. 

Two questions: 

1.	Is half of Peter’s class now 5 years older and Peter will have to navigate that? It would be weird to have half of your class suddenly be adults and the other half have experienced coming back from the snap.
2.	Where did Steve get that shield he gave to Falcon? The shield Tony gave him was destroyed in the battle with Thanos. His original shield was in the ice and his 2012 shield is still in 2012."
127,elsxtji,"My whole theater started clapping when Captain picked up thors hammer, amazing scene"
128,elsybn2,[deleted]
129,elu27gu,"Was anybody else convinced Cap was going to die in the final fight? His shield was broken, he was on rocky land, and those flying aliens were overhead. It was exactly like Tony’s worst fear in Age of Ultron.

But instead of Tony not saving them like he imagined, he saved the entire world. It was definitely a great scene."
130,eltgnll,FUCKING DUEL WEILDING AXE HAMMER THOR FUCK
131,elta6hi,Nebula easily got one of the best character development in the whole MCU.
132,elszbtx,"Captain America giving the shield to Falcon was amazing. You don’t have to be a super solider, genius, or be a god to hold the shield. You just have to be a good person.

Also Bucky knew that Captain was retiring when he went back. Banner was sure that he would come back in 5 seconds, Sam asked to go with him. All Bucky said was he was going to miss him.

Needless to say Falcon and the Winter Solider hype!"
133,eltk77j,"Best line no one laughed at:

[When the asgardians were chasing rocket and shouted “stop that rabbit!”](#spoiler)"
134,elsz0vp,"Gamora: This is the one? Seriously?

Nebula: The choices were him or a tree.

Starlord: Am I a joke to you?"
135,elsxqrt,"So, when Antman crawled into Thanos’ ass I cheered out loud in the theater"
136,elsxnc0,"I know that the build-up was slow after they decacipated Thanos but I think it is necessariy so we can feel like their pain and grief, I think it is important. Also the build-up made the third act more epic and feel really earned after we saw what they expereinced during those five years.

[I also think that this paragraph from Mashable review is really represent how I view Endgame as a Narrative and MCU on their influences in movie industry.](https://mashable.com/article/avengers-endgame-review/)

> It is, however, a moment to stop and look back in amazement (or terror) at what the MCU has pulled off. From the relatively humble Iron Man — a Paramount picture about a then C-list comic book hero — the MCU has grown into an empire. And Endgame is Marvel's crowning achievement."
137,elteuyu,That would suck for the regular people who survived the snap and made a new life for themselves in the 5 years... maybe re-married or had kids.
138,elsy4m0,"'I knew it!!!' 

That scene with Cap and the Hammer was so freaking cool!!"
139,eltg3gn,"I think we can all agree that all of us were thinking Cap was gonna say ""Before we get started does anyone wanna get out?"" 

But 

The fact that we got Haip Hydra is even better

Edit: HAIL. I'm sorry I'm just so hypedddd I'm going again in 30 minutes for another show!!!"
140,elt6yr7,"I just wanted to see a great action movie and here I am relating to Thor as a pointed depiction of depression: underachiever, bloats up, stays in his room, plays video games, gets some wisdom from his mother, “Everyone fails at who they are supposed to be. The measure of a person, a hero, is how they succeed at being who they are.”  

I saw what you did, Russo Brothers. Thank you."
141,eltdped,"I loved that the whole first half of the movie was just ""Scott Lang reacts to things"""
142,elsz4a6,[deleted]
143,elt5s9n,That wide angle shot of Captain America standing up to Thanos' amassing army was practically a work of art.  Incredible movie.
144,eltjt0w,"When cap says ""Hail Hydra"" @_@"
145,elt7x51,"One of the best ""time travel"" movies I've ever scene. Even better than Die Hard."
146,elt70jm,"“That is indeed America’s ass.”

- Chris Evans, 2019"
147,eltaimu,"So Clint was still paying his wife's cellphone bill five years later? Damn, that shows some real dedication."
148,eltja9z,"Spiderman rode a pegasus.

10/10, never even thought I wanted that"
149,elu21uf,Speaking of the tesseract- what happened to it in the 2012 New York timeline when Loki stole it? Does he have it still and is teleporting wherever he wants?
150,elu53ow,"Oh my god.

Tesseract: Thor (Post Credits), Cap 1, Avengers, Guardians (very briefly), Ragnarok, Infinity War, Captain Marvel, Endgame

Clint: Thor, Avengers, Age of Ultron, Civil War, Endgame"
151,eltslc4,I loved that Scott was the only one interested in Thor explaining the events from that movie.
152,eltwi6f,I liked that Ant-Man was super into the story because he had no idea what was going on
153,elt9fkd,I found it funny that even the asgardians called Rocket a rabbit.
154,elwe118,"Imagine Natalie Portman getting the call

""Yeah, we need you back for a final hurrah!""

NP: ""Ok...what do I do?""

""Just get out of bed in the most unbelievably sexiest way possible from a top view."""
155,eltqycu,So he’s an idiot?
156,eltxm6n,"I could never look like Thor, so they made Thor look like me!"
157,eltkwci,"Red skull: finally, the soul stone is gone. I am free.

Cap appears. He throws the stone back off the cliff.

RS: Rogers? What did you just do?

Cap disappears."
158,elt4apu,Specially after she's got her own movie coming up
159,elt9z3y,"I feel like this is not talked about enough. 

The scene with her and Clint fighting over who gets to died was gut wrenching."
160,eltfze6,"""I tired to bring her back."" - Professor Hulk. This line was not an accident."
161,elthlrf,At first I joked that Thanos in his hut looked like Shrek.
162,elt3d7u,Also hulk wearing trendy sweaters and shit
163,elsz9wt,some dude on movie theories actually nailed it
164,elt9o15,"That moment when it went to black before ""5 years later"" popped up, I looked over to my friend and said, ""That's it. That's the movie."""
165,elu2uia,"Honestly lost my shit there, that just looked nice and was a smart ass play by Thanos"
166,eltwszj,"Dude i frickin love professor hulk.

Especially when they travel back to NY from the first avengers movie and he has to pretend to smash shit like the old Hulk.

That was hilarious"
167,elvmeyl,pegasus
168,elthuog,"That's what was so amazing. Everyone loved that part, but in the comics it was the most hated moment in comics."
169,elts279,"My favorite was Ant Man saluting Captain America, ""As far as I'm concerned that's America's Ass!"""
170,elu68u9,So hes an idiot. Lol
171,eltfj2j,"Agreed, Classic GotG. Totally would have been me singing off key if I were in fact rolling through a bunch of space rats looking for an infinity stone... that he didn’t  know was an infinity stone made it even more Quill."
172,elvp9k2,"Perfectly executed.
Riff starts and everyone knows what scene is coming. Then you get Chris Pratt acting more like Andy than starlord."
173,elwkg0s,"I really loved all of the back to the future II scenes like this where you see the ""behind the scenes"" reality of iconic scenes, like Hulk having to walk down stairs after thrashing Loki or the big Avengers climax being followed by Clint getting a drink while Loki is very procedurqlly arrested."
174,eltejbm,Thing is that thanos was a shell of his former self.      I was not surprised they killed him. But i was impressed that he stood by what he did. Even though it cost him his health and strength
175,elteioi,"I'd also like to note that Disney allowed Marvel to break one of their core rules for that.

AFAIK their only two solid rules were no on screen decapitations, and no real-life drug abuse. Fictional drugs were fine, if I remember correctly.

Thor just fuckin' yeeted him and there sure as hell wasn't a quick cut to disguise it."
176,eltbmfr,In case people didn't know it's the exact same actor from the agent Carter tv show. Where he plays Howard starks butler and Peggy best friend and partner
177,elt2pwq,[deleted]
178,eltgx10,The helmet in the lab in the 70s is a reference to the comics antman helmet
179,elth2mv,"Potential future Easter eggs:

Rocket talks about the  effects of the snap “ground zero” for cosmic anomalies... mutants?

Okoye mentions tremors at the earths core.... namor?"
180,eltgnrl,"Edwin Jarvis,who was with Howard Stark, was the same actor from the Agent Carter show."
181,elt38s4,Thanos should be a marriage counselor
182,elu9w8x,Thanos hit Captain Marvel so hard with the power stone she exited the movie.
183,elthcny,"""I KNEW IT!"""
184,elu178k,"That whole scene when he's picking himself up, tightens down his shield and walks up to face an entire ARMY. The level of resolve you can see in his whole being, ready to take them all on to the end...THAT gave me some chills."
185,eltetq3,Rudd killed it in every scene.
186,eltebu4,The rat saved the universe
187,eltmv07,Best part nobody's talking about: Giant Man decking a flying space worm with one punch. That was soooooo satisfying to watch.
188,elta41z,"The scene at the diner with Hulk killed me. ""You want a picture with me too?"""
189,elti2ac,I literally thought he was dead when Thanos just bombs the shit out of Avengers HQ.
190,elu65k2,"His huge smile as Thor was recounting The Dark World, while the rest of the Avengers were over it."
191,eltfyph,"The inclusion of Rudd made Endgame funnier.

Plus, his character was the catalyst of the time travel thing with his pym particles."
192,elu1n5f,"I like to believe that in the 14m possibilities, they all failed because he didn't give up the stone. And then the one that he did, they win."
193,elt3vgx,No.  She realized that HE was sending HER a message about it being OKAY to let go of the time stone for the greater good. It was the only way she'd agree to give up the stone.
194,elv6rtd,I've got a sudden urge to use Axe™︎ Body Spray
195,eltzmo0,Did you trade in the Acura you bought after watching the first Avengers film?
196,elvvczv,"Want to, but no time. Playing Fortnite."
197,eltfufc,"Want one more? 

“Ah, Captain America. God’s righteous man. Pretending you could live without war.” - Ultron 

At the end Cap lived his life without war. He got the dance he missed so long ago."
198,elt421r,Dude. Steve was sent off fantastically in this film.  Mjolnir.  That is all that needs to be said.  My theater went crazy... Anyone who had to pee by that point just let it fly.
199,elt3zyc,"I was totally waiting for, ""Before we start, does anyone want to get off?"""
200,elt0qva,It took 5 years. “Now I Am Become Dude”
201,elt94wu,He even wore a fucking pattrrned Cardigan and they mimicked Donnys funeral at the end when he gave his kinhdom to Valkyrie.
202,elt40pz,Also Tony leans over in the past to hug his father and thanks him for his service.
203,elufea6,"The movie had such a strong theme of Fatherhood which was so refreshing. 

Thanos the bad father who sacrifices his beloved daughter Gamora and tortures his other daughter Nebula just so he can selfishly fulfill his ambitions. 

Iron Man the good father to Morgan. Who goes from selfish brat to realizing that that’s what he is to Peter as well. And then sacrificing himself to save both of them and the world. While also passing some wisdom to his own Dad.

Thanos and Tony. A tale of two fathers who face-off in a battle of wills and destiny. Two opposing sides of the same coin. Oh *snap*.

P.S. Also Ant Man and Hawkeye loving fathers who are off-kilter. And Frigga rounding it off with that wonderful Mom moment. What a wholesome movie about a bunch of Supers blasting the crap out of each other."
204,elta6vo,"I took that autograph as them ""signing off"" - beautiful moment."
205,elubvm3,I didn’t notice that. Good catch.
206,elw5vow,"That was a rare occasion where dragging the line out a shitton was fuckin perfect

Normally it feels overdone

But fuckin a man, 20 something movies in?

I.      Am. Iron Man.

Fuck. Yes. 

So good. Had no idea what he was going to say, and hell yea"
207,eltkuua,Its started by Tony saying I am Iron Man and it ended with the same sentence
208,elupsxv,"As he lay dying I was afraid they were going to give him more lines, ending with I am Iron Man, god just perfection."
209,elt9b8q,"And now that the Gamora/Quill relationship has been reset, it's become a choice between Quail, God of beer Thor and a tree. 

&#x200B;

Oh hell yes."
210,elt0u8g,Guarantee it’ll be called Asgardians of the Galaxy
211,elt39fz,This is like the most awesome thing to me. I love his character and especially love his interactions with the Guardians.
212,elt2d9n,Family plan.
213,elt4x97,Knowing Verizon they wouldn’t let him out of the contract
214,elwbgnn,His surprise was understandable considering he did nothing but play fortnite all day for the past 5 years :D
215,elyvivo,I loved how Thor just melted when he saw his mother and told her everything. Even Thor needs his mommy to tell him things will be okay!
216,elwerqq,"He was an emotional wreck, and that really made him a great character throughout the movie, because you can see how he ascends back to greatness!"
217,elucpyd,"Iron Man either died right there, or after having 5 extra years and a daughter. Strange still gave him the best option."
218,eluebwp,"Holy shit.

Strange saved him just so that he could sacrifice himself. I can’t believe this just hit me, thank you!

Beautiful."
219,eltgyyo,He knew of the Avengers. The Thanos in 2014 already tried to invade Earth in 2012 with Loki. He even mentions in Infinity War that he respects Stark for thwarting his invasion in 2012.
220,elt7gfs,Ooooh.
221,elt7oc7,Thanks for this! I couldn't figure out who he was.
222,eltg5vg,"That genuinely did bother me in a way it shouldn't have. I'm sitting there like ""no... Fuck this.. I'm a huge fan, I've watched every movie a bunch of times and I don't know who he is... Fuck.. If my gf asks I'll have to make something up"""
223,eltpis2,I'm predicting soooooo many cosplays of fat thor over the next few years
224,eltirxx,Chungus Thor bod is the hot look for the second half of 2019.
225,eltzurb,Does no one want to talk about how he can braid his beard and hair with his lightning? Did I imagine that or was it not like that before he charged up to beat on Thanos?
226,elt24pt,Imagine being Dr. Strange having to trust that the rat will fulfill its destiny for them to arrive at the 1 in 14m ending
227,elsz064,Literally the world would still be fucked if it wasnt for that rat
228,elt4es5,When /where was the rat?
229,elt21zq,Really made up for the whole black plague ordeal
230,eltg7yb,"Not a real line of dialogue
Thor: ""Ah Banner,you play Fortnite as well?"""
231,eltemtg,"Yep, Fat Thor posts are going to drown reddit once Halloween rolls around this year."
232,elt38ea,"The knowing look Tony gives back to him, goddamn."
233,elt40j3,"The acting in that scene was incredible. That ""1"" was when Tony knew he'd have to make the sacrifice play - because Strange had *just* told Tony he couldn't say if they were on the right path because it would jeopardize the plan. Loved it."
234,eltccqi,True that. I had no clue where it was going next. And the slow reveal of “FIVE.... YEARS... LATER” hah!
235,eltd8q4,">It's a goldmine for desktop backgrounds 

This is exactly what went through my head at least 3 seperate times"
236,eltdcff,"I almost expected him to echo *""I can do this all day""* from earlier."
237,elvp8ie,When the Avengers showed up en masse I absolutely lost it. Cried like a baby. What a beautiful moment.
238,eltdbsh,"Dude, I was crying it was so badass."
239,elt3xef,Falcon puuuunch
240,elt7983,"He really did get such a perfect ending! Coming into the movie I was so sure he was going to die just because of how much everyone else said it, and Thanos with that knife thing had me so mf scared. Contrasting that to what actually happened, wow!!! Made me so happy :)"
241,elt57m0,show me your moves!
242,eltv5f1,"Almost was sobbing at the end when they cut to the house and Peg and Cap dancing.

When he was in the base in the 70s and snuck into an office and you can see the last half of her name on the door, I was the only one that gasped in my theater and started tearing up.

Fuck I love Peg and Cap. I couldn’t be happier with this"
243,elsyebc,"Yep, first completely tv original character to cross streams. Though Kevin Feige actually had a producer credit on Agent Carter which might explain things. Joe Russo also directed an episode in season 1. Either way it legitimizes the SHIELD side of marvel T.V. at least"
244,elszdpj,"\>Joe Russo as the guy mourning the loss of his partner with Cap

Oh, that was Joe Russo? Thanks, I had been wondering. I thought his voice sounded a lot like Ruffalo's but it didn't make much sense."
245,elt306z,"His eyeroll and subsequent ""Yeah, I know"" when his younger self went ""I can do this all day"" was hilarious."

250,elsxxtc,So cool to see The Ancient One back didn't expect that!
251,elsynm6,"That was a shock, Jarvis, Howard, Jane, Loki getting new lines, Crossbones, even Robert Redford I can't believe they got EVERY character from the Marvel universe in there."
252,elt50h5,She gave a Git tutorial
253,elt1aaf,The Captain America WS call backs were all fantastic. The Hail Hydra killed me because Cap did the PERFECT lean in.
254,elt3q9a,"He had the most memorable moments easily: Hail Hydra, the Hammer scene, Avenger's Assemble and him facing down Thanos' army all alone. 

Also fun fact: Captain America spoiled Captain America for Captain America"
255,elt27l2,I had so many theories going in. Then 20 minutes into the movie they chop off Thanos' head and I had zero ideas left.
256,elt17gz,"""Oh, this is nice""."
257,elt1kc4,"""You can rest now"" was what we said to my dad in hospital last year. So, yeah."
258,eltgdnf,"He's just so innocent. Man, Tom Holland has done an amazing job, and while I will always have a fat nostalgia boner for Tobey, Tom is a worth Spiderman."
259,elt4qpx,"Yeah, her reaction of “leave it alone” said it all"
260,elt0gqk,"I didn't quite get that part. It was implied that there were other ""events"" happening on other planets."
261,elu43x6,"I cried more for RDJ than I did for Tony. I’m so glad RDJ made his mark on the world and changed so many peoples lives and bettered himself. He came from rock bottom with drugs to the very tip-top and became such a warm, lovable person. I was happy for him, but devastated to see him go."
262,elt591a,She's one of the most powerful beings in all of Marvel cannon so it's awesome to get to see her flex on screen
263,eltktmb,"""I don't even know who you are.""

""You will."""
264,elsxxcv,So Sam has the shield but the question is does he have the ass?
265,elt0mxz,Woman in my theatre said “God bless America” at that
266,eltc08a,"Her death shocked me the most, I would have never guessed she was going to die! Hindsight you can see how depressed she was during the 1st act and how its not like her. She always finds a way but she seem to have given up after 5 years. She showed more enthusiasm knowing she has to be sacrificed."

288,elt39zo,"I cry a lot at movies. This movie was brutal for like 30 solid minutes at the end.

The beginning got me bad too."
289,elth832,I lost it when Thor talked to his mom. It's just such a human moment. So many people have wished they could go back and talk to one of their parents and here he is doing it in the middle of a time heist to save the galaxy.
290,elsyaxe,It was such the perfect sendoff for Steve Rogers.
291,elszpkt,But he lived his whole life with Peggy knowing full well Bucky was getting tortured by Hydra the entire time. :(((((
292,elsyoyo,"No no no, you get the little one..."
293,elt4tfh,"It was so good when he fucked up Thanos with it, and the lightning!"
294,elt5e6w,When the horn honked part of me genuinely thought he was going to drive through with the van. I don't care if it wouldn't have made any sense.
295,elxjdni,Please make an orderly queue to say farewell to Iron Man.
296,eltqqbg,That reminded me of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.

300,elszgo3,"I knew I was gonna hear that line, just not like that. 😂"
301,elszml0,"A lot of Thor scenes were popular with the kids.  The Fortnite bit, him and rabbit creeping past Loki, he's going to be great in Guardians of the Galaxy 3."

303,elt1z75,Scarlet Witch getting her revenge in the most epic mega pissed way

308,elsyn7e,"> mirroring Thanos he can ""*Finally rest. To a grateful universe*.""

I'm glad I wasn't the only person to notice this. Phenomenal duality of characters who had to do what it took."
309,elsycr6,"Great to see Jon Favreau talking to Tony's daughter at the end since he was the director who kicked all this off.

Edit: also kudos to Marvel for staying on very good terms with all their actors and directors and seeing so many come back in this movie.  They almost lost James Gunn and Drax because of Disney meddling but Gunn was back as Executive producer of End Game and is on board for Guardians 3.  Compare this to the turnover of directors and actors in the DC universe."
310,elsyqch,It always had to be him or Cap and I think they made the right choice. It was beautifully poetic.
311,eltvhf5,I love that Korg needs Thor to talk shit for him in online games. He's made on the outside not the inside.
312,eltjz4x,"There's a lot of consequences similar to that to think about. Children aging without their parents, people unfortunatetly committing suicide after the tragedy only for their snapped relatives to return etc. The snap really would have changed society to it's core."

317,elsy6vv,"We finally got ""Avengers, assemble"" :)"
318,elt2y3k,Ant Man’s “how did you not know they were evil... look at them!” Was pretty accurate
319,elsyytk,Disney+ TV show will explain I'm sure
320,elsz2rs,"Presumably this Loki will be the one in the TV show. Kinda bait and switch, IMO."

330,elsz6mv,Kid from iron man 3

377,elts9yx,"The only spoiler I tell my friends is the hulk dab and thot plays fortnite, no one believes me tho"
378,elu99mg,That one hurt so much. Tony knew what he had to do but was asking Strange if this is the one because his whole goal was to live in the present for his daughter and Pepper and he just wanted to make sure this was the only way to do it before he did. I think if Strange told him earlier Tony changes his behavior so he can live for his family but that would mean they lose.
379,eltqubc,"I think it's Tony asking Strange if his sacrifice play was going to work, and Strange replied yes by signalling the one chance."
380,elt7502,"It was Dr. Strange giving a send-off. ""This is the only way"", knowing Tony will take it up."
381,eltbksp,"I think I saw another comment in this post say that if he told Tony too early, Tony would try to find a way out. It had to be timed just right."
382,eltgrt5,"I look forward to someone mashing up the ""five years later"" title card with the Spongebob Squarepants audio."
383,elt0a6z,"I've always considered Agent Carter to be 100% canon, because of the involvement of Feige and others from Marvel Studios proper. I think this really sealed it for me."
384,eltek9t,"That was possibly the funniest line in the movie. That was just perfect. Like, he was older, grumpier and just not in any mood for that bullshit."
385,elth1ur,That’s America’s ass
386,elszfcm,"Managed to subvert your expectations in ways you didn't even know you wanted. I was so excited there was going to be that amazing fight scene with an older and wiser Cap. Then he was like ""fuck that"" here's something even better."
387,elt0n0e,This is how I find out Gary Shandling is dead.
388,elt0imt,And so cool to see the Sanctum Sanctorum during the Battle of New York.
389,elszl0b,"Sadly, except Coulson"
390,eltbty8,[deleted]
391,elt7640,"That scene when he met Cap, oh my lord
The hammer scene was so perfect as well

Along with his final stand, you can tell he was full on ready to die fighting that damned army and it was so tear jerking."
392,elt99ij,It’s not everyday you get to complement your own ass from above.
393,elv6tzq,I thought that meant: wtf do you expect us to do. Rather than there's an entire civilization down there you don't want to mess with.
394,elu4i3g,"Same. Iron man is one thing, love him. But no longer having any marvel movies with RDJ? that hurts"
395,eltb8yj,We really hadn’t had the chance to see it before and I’m so happy it finally happened!
396,elsxzzg,Gotta see him in the suit
397,elt13po,Why do you think Cap chose Sam over Bucky? He's seen that ass.
398,eltm9vb,"When it was her and Clint going after the soul stone, I was expecting her to sacrifice herself; for the very reason, he had a family. But she at least learned her father’s name."
399,elszc4n,*Carol Danvers has left the movie again*
400,elsz7vt,And begins to thoroughly wreck everything around her. Thanos buys himself some time with quick thinking when she's clearly about to put her entire fist up his ass and use him as a fucking Grimace hand puppet.
401,elu0tag,She is one of the most powerful mutants in the comics
402,elu0jbl,"There was so much malice behind that simple line, it gave me chills."
403,elt8ihx,I'm much more excited for Far From Home now.
404,elt6y98,"> At 15

Yup. Totally just at 15. Haha, yeah."
405,elto79j,Lmaooo. Dude is straight up nuts.
406,elumzjr,"I wonder how much he really had a say in the matter. From an outside perspective, it feels like the studio forced him out and a large part of his movie wiped from the MCU."
407,eltmnvb,Ditto. That’s fucking awesome.
408,eltbvh9,"If there was any doubt in my mind about the movie being good, it was completely erased as Clint desperately looked for his family while they evaporated around him in that first couple of minutes. Holy shit"
409,eltkrso,[deleted]
410,elt4eoe,I feel like Thanos would be a JojaMart player
411,elt3e6d,#ARE WE BLIND?  DEPLOY THE CHITAURI!
412,eltftlh,"Hemsworth has great comedic timing. Also not sure if anyone noticed, but him and Chris Pratt have great chemistry on screen. Hope we get to see more of them together in future films"
413,elsyzaf,"It is a very good question, and perhaps they aren't ever going to. Instead of trying to top it they'll have to try something else, instead of peaking again maybe plateauing is what the future holds and it isn't necessarily a bad thing.  

The meddling with time does make Kang a possibility down the line. Plus it allows shenanigans if they want to bring back Steve or Tony for a movie and make people go insane a few years down the line."
414,elsyy70,They cant. Theres no way.
415,elszkvy,"Fuck, I didn't even notice that."
416,eltdmts,"Damn right. Everything that is and ever will be, exists now because of Tony Stark and his ultimate sacrifice."
417,elsyp4m,And the end credits audio being him hammering. It was beautiful.
418,elsyoqd,"Man... how perfect. 

What a fitting ending. People in my theater were hollering like crazy when that happened. And I don’t think I’ve ever heard a completely packed theater as quiet as it was during the funeral. Absolutely beautiful."
419,elsyjk0,"And the callback to the cheeseburgers he got for Tony.

This whole movie just felt like such a bowtie to the whole MCU, I almost dread any new films after this that might untie it."
420,elt8wta,"""When you're the god of thunder, you become very sexy"""
421,elt0bbv,"That blueballs they gave us at the end of Avengers 2. 4 fucking years since they teased that. I've heard of tantric, but that's just ridiculous."
422,elsy5jk,"The way that purple ass cheek jiggled as it exploded across the screen, true cinematic genius"
423,elvx12f,No dogs on the moon!
424,elxa0fs,"Who gets to date the model hot super spy scientist daughter of model hot super spy scientist parents who were also major figures in American history from their SHIELD and science and saving the world roles. 

Scott is “us”."
425,eltmk4b,"""Maybe I am"""
426,elx2elf,I want to know what he does with the reality stone. Does he have to re-inject it into Natalie Portman?
427,elt8mef,"Unless they decide to use the timelime they took the infinity stones from they will have to, its not new to them to go back in the timeline for new movies"
428,elxo2du,"Even without the stones, he's still super durable, strong and a super genius. Even without the stones, he's still tough as hell to take down."
429,eltvcfd,While simultaneously mirroring the elevator scene.  Such. a good. moment.
430,elvz8b0,I enjoyed how Drax wasn't even considered as an option :-)
431,elv6d1e,"Agreed, I absolutely love that Thor was happy for him :)"
432,elu8gj5,"If in the first act you have put a hammer on the ground, in the next act, Cap should use it. Otherwise, don’t put it there."
433,eluky7j,I think I had goosebumps during the entire final fight. What a fuckin spectacle.
434,eluu6w2,Coulson never complimented America's Ass like Scott! The true fan!
435,elubwxk,And stepping on cull! He is reckless
436,elv3z7n,Dump trucks full of orange slices rolling up to the Lang Household
437,elu3shj,"""He literally just said he doesn't want to take a photo with me."""
438,eltj8sf,People forget Paul Rudd is also actually a fairly great actor as well as being fucking hilarious
439,elt7xk0,Its the kind of paradox that can only exist in time travel situations.
440,elty7dw,"That's why he sent sam over to talk to old Steve. He'd already said his good-bye. I'm a little bummed that winter soldier didn't get the shield, but I can't be upset with the result and how it was done."
441,elu3qnn,"That really got me that she held strong, and said exactly what he needed to hear so he could go peacefully. It was really beautiful."
442,elweqt0,"It killed me because when she said you can rest now she really meant it. Between Iron Man 1, 2, 3 and Avengers 1, 2, 3, and 4 and even Civil War Tony has always been trying to find a way to keep the people he cares about safe from this impending threat that was Thanos. Whether it was “”a suit of armor around the world”, “ a vision”, or even “Ultron” all he wanted to do was keep people safe and rest. Now he finally gets to rest. Easily up there with Logan in terms of saddest and most bittersweet death scene."
443,elweudl,"“You can rest now.”

Cried like a baby"
444,elu044q,"I was a struggling mess trying to figure it out.. ""Wait? Was Tony working with X and Magneto when they went recruiting Quiksilver??"""
445,elu2zky,People called that kid annoying when it first came out. He was great in Iron Man 3.
446,elt4yj3,"No fucking wonder he didn't want to tell Tony about the timeline where they win.

""THE RAT IS THE KEY TO EVERYTHING TONY!"""
447,elt6mvz,[deleted]
448,eluv0l1,"The Avengers learned in Endgame that personal sacrifice was required to win. It's been the biggest theme of the past two movies. They weren't willing to make the personal ones like Thanos did in Infinity War. I'm sad to see Stark and Natasha go, but they did it in the best ways."
449,elu7swg,"You can bet in one of the failed futures that Strange saw, he *didn't* tell Tony. Tony felt defeated at that moment, and by telling him that this was the one, Strange gave him back his hope and totally rejuvenated him enough to take the stones."
450,eltptyx,There was no other way....
451,elwcw6x,Cap and Hulk both feeling like they were too old to act like their 2012 versions was hilarious.
452,elu8rc7,"I don't know, it was followed by ""That really is America's ass."" I loved that line so much."
453,elt153u,And seeing her fight off aliens as well.
454,elt0k22,"Oh fuck you, now I'm sad we didn't get Coulson back somehow."
455,eltagxo,ON YOUR LEFT.
456,elvnkvg,If Namor is down there its both
457,elt18bn,"That moment he pulled the Power Stone off and thrash her with it...

Even though Thanos is the bad guy, that move was too badass to not want him to win."

460,eltn9ev,"Don't know whether you saw, but if you click it again >!it uses the time stone to bring them back!<"
461,eltgbub,"Can’t believe they all lost the coin flip. That hit hard. I think Pepper summed it up well later, “We were lucky...lots of people weren’t.”"
462,elthnfk,"Calling it now - GotG 3 will be a comic love triangle between Gamora and those two, especially with her being old Gamora who only just met them both."
463,elt1gzp,"There was a certain family of four and a team of mutants absent from that field.

I kid, though. I don't think they can either...unless...Doom starts some multiverse shenanigans, maybe?"
464,elt0kur,It was as the Marvel Studios logo was appearing at the *very* end.
465,elt064u,Proof that Tony Stark has a heart
466,elsz6kl,Just when I thought I was done crying
467,elxiblc,Captain America penetrates jane foster
468,eltbqyr,Could be somewhere in those 5 years too.
469,elxpvba,"Yeah, he beat the shit out of Cap, Thor, and Iron Man with *zero* stones. Really drives home how in Infinity War he wasn't trying to kill people on Titan, he needed the Time Stone."
470,em2xwy5,He broke a fucking vibranium shield. That impressed the shit out of me!
471,elvinwb,"I was totally convinced there was a ""Before we begin, do any of you gentlemen want to get out?"" coming, and then Cap just goes ""Hail Hydra"" and I'm like ""OH SHIT"".

Such a fun expectation subversion."
472,elwn093,"Bevause he was invisible

okay. now what?"
473,elul3r9,It's honestly the most epic thing I think I've ever seen. It'll be hard going back to grounded Marvel movies lol
474,eltkg3x,Absolutely. I really think having him in the MCU is one of great unsung casting choices of the entire series. He's basically one of the most effortlessly charming and hilarious actors in Hollywood.
475,eluc0tr,Like Howard stark giving Tony that knowledge that it turns out Tony gave howard to give to Tony to give to Howard to give to Tony yo give to Howard to..
476,eltz2dk,He doesn't need a shield. He has his arm.
477,elv68mm,Seriously. The strength to be able to say that to someone you love must be insane.
478,elwz13g,"And there's the line earlier in the movie when he says he could put a pin in it and go to bed. She asks ""but would you be able to rest?"""
479,elt58gh,"It makes sense but I think Tony would have still made the sacrifice, arguably Strange was actually just biding his time to set up the right moment for when he could tell Tony with the 1 finger held up."
480,elvmqnp,"I unfortunately went into it having seen a spoiler about Tony sacrificing himself, and there was so much foreshadowing it was almost obvious. 

- Him telling Pepper it was the last surprise 
- His conversation with his father about ""selfish"" vs ""good for humanity""   
- His conversation with Pepper about whether he could sleep at night  
- Dr. Strange after visiting 14 million timelines looking directly at Tony and saying ""I'm sorry, this is the only way""  
- Dr. Strange telling him he can't tell him or it will change the outcome  

They really set it up perfectly. It was the perfect ending for Tony Stark."
481,eltubcz,"It's like he was retroactively apologizing... Fuck, amazing"
482,eltj7t4,Just her casually hanging out in the rooftop just waving off Chitauri aliens lol
483,eltm1gc,I loved she put a hat on the sleeping physical body of the hulk and in a chair instead of letting him lay on the ground.  She is so nice and considerate
484,elt556e,At least we got him in Captain Marvel.
485,elt6ti0,That was fucking sick. I was glad he had a few new tricks beyond just putting the glove on repeatedly
486,elt2m3o,[deleted]
487,elxm8i1,"Then he goes back out to fight crime. Then back for more full penetration. Crime, penetration, crime, penetration, and it goes on like this until the movie just kind of...ends."
488,eltejz3,"Hey, that'd actually be cool, did not think of that. We really need to see more of those 5 years."
489,elwbazd,"Another fun piece about that is that I watched an interview the Russos gave just a few days ago and they were asked if they remember the first scene they shot for the MCU, and the answer was the elevator scene in Winter Soldier."
490,elw6guz,"Lol dude same

I don't remember the last I felt that feeling in a theater

You *knew* it was about to fucking go down. And a hundred different ""THEY'RE BACK!!!""'s

For a second I actually thought the movie was going to end with them charging at each other"
491,elu0kd9,"He'd the arm in the comics, still took the mantle of Cap after Steve's death. I have no issue with how they did it really, but personally I wanted Bucky to be the next Cap."
492,elt5m7t,I think Strange knew Tony would look for another way out if he was told any sooner.  He only told him when it became obvious there *was* no other way.
493,elvryfa,"I kinda always had a feeling Tony was going to sacrifice himself ever since Scarlet Witch showed him the nightmare scenario at the beginning of AoU. Him also suffering from PTSD during Iron Man 3 also added fuel to the fire of wanting to continuously wanting to protect not just his friends but the world someone. Ever since Avengers 1, he's always felt the burden."
494,elxhr9n,"There was also the bit from the first Avengers where Steve tells Tony:

""You're not the guy to make the sacrifice play, to lay down on a wire and let the other guy crawl over you.""

And we all thought Tony proved him wrong by carrying the missile through the portal later in the movie, but that wasn't the real sacrifice play. This has been set up since the first Avengers."
495,eluugof,Lets not forget that Stephen Strange was still performing surgery DURING the Battle of New York!
496,elt59ji,"I was gonna say not enough, but then again we’ve had well over 50 hours of him on AoS so maybe I’m being greedy."
497,elw3n9e,I felt it so much when Pepper said “You can rest now”
498,elv0foe,"I imagine a lot of injured people were being brought to the hospital, they were probably absolutely full trying to help everyone. Haha he probably could have never imagined that just 6 years later he would be a vital part in concluding the war that started there."

0,cvlipnj,I think Matt Damon by now should be pretty familiar with the airlock blowing up in space
1,cvlb2of,I thought Benedict Wong stole every scene as the head of JPL.
2,cvlhrvg,"As brilliant as Matt Damon was in the lead role, I thought most of the supporting characters (read: all of them!) were all superb. Jeff Daniels, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Benedict Wong, Kristen Wiig, Jessica Chastain, Sean Bean & Donald Glover all gave very good performances. 

Really great film!"
3,cvlb3sc,"Just got home from seeing it.  
  
* I haven't seen a Thursday soft opening (non-midnight) that packed in quite some time. This movie is going to do well at the box office
* I loved the theme of disco music they kept weaving through the movie, setting up one of the biggest reactions in my theater with ""Survivor"" as the ending theme.
* Was I the only one who didn't feel as tense as I expected throughout the movie, until the final rescue scenes? Maybe it was Damon's cockiness that translated into me thinking everything would be fine, but for the plot of this movie I never really felt like the odds were against him until the end (as odd as that seems to say)
 "
4,cvl9qsj,I'd like to think that Sean Bean was cast because of the secret meeting scene. 
5,cvlbs5p,"While Matt Damon is wonderful in this role from the first moment we see him in screen, that moment after the airlock explosion when he's trying to count potatoes during the storm just floored me.  He knows full well that if his makeshift repair gives out, that's it he's dead.  He portrayed that raw emotion of refusing to give in yet knowing that he could literally die at any moment amazingly well"
6,cvlas2p,"TIL that PG-13 movies are allowed to have TWO F-words now.

And I loved them both so much."
7,cvla8av,"I thought Chiwetel Ejiofor and Jeff Daniels were absolutely fantastic. I also commend Scott on keeping the narrative from feeling too dragged out -- they're in space for so many Sols but the plot moved quickly enough to keep you engaged throughout.

Also that scene with Watney dipping the potato in crushed Vicodin follwed by the ""It's been 5 days since I've run out of ketchup"" line was fantastic. "
8,cvl8xy7,"Sebastian Stan is an exceptionally handsome man.

Also, probably my favourite part of the whole film is how they really emphasized Lewis' love of disco as part of her character and not just a funny little quirk. Her husband surprising her with the ABBA vinyl on their video call got the biggest laugh from me."
9,cvlatui,"This is one of the best examples you can find of a film adaptation. So many people complain when the film doesn't follow the book exactly. Changing the medium means you may have to change certain things to make everything flow. The filmmaker's goal should be to capture the tone of the story and bring it to life on the screen, and Ridley Scott was excellent at doing that for this film."
10,cvlbdx1,"I will survive, perfect credits song. "
11,cvlc18d,"I didn't know I needed to see Matt Damon singing and dancing to ""Hot Stuff"" in a mars rover until tonight."
12,cvl8ykh,Holy shit sean bean made it to the end of the movie! Thats the real survivor right there
13,cvlbshr,"Can we get a shout out to the real heroes of this film? Tarps and duct tape.

Apparently tarps can seal just about anything. Near vacuum, 60mph winds, and 195 degrees below zero? Toss a tarp across the door, no problem. Need more room in the car? Tarp bubble. Ok I admit the tap let him down near the end, but that's because he didn't use duct tape."
14,cvldmnr,"Anybody feel that the body double was really obvious? When he was walking out of the shower and is all skinny and bruised. Then it cuts to a front on shot of his muscular forearms. 

Not a major thing, just funny."
15,cvltbb7,"So Pena's characters wife must have divorced him, can't think of any other way he'd be going back to Mars at the end..."
16,cvlntdd,"Two things that bugged me

1. Vogel was not German enough. There was only like one discernible ""Ja"" uttered.
2. ""Teddy: I wonder what's going to through Watney's head right now? Watney: How come Aquaman can control whales? They’re mammals! Makes no sense."" I was anticipating that line the whole time but it was totally butchered. 

Anyway, that's enough nitpicking. I thoroughly enjoyed the film, I think it was a great adaptation that'll get a lot more people to read the book which was such an engaging read. 

Edit: These are differences between the FILM and the BOOK. I AM NOT arguing cultural depictions, stereotypical or not. /u/ConstantSky has a point, but it is beyond the scope of my silly post. Cheers. "
17,cvlc28d,"Ok, apart from *THAT* line, I found this the most **pro-science** hollywood film I have ever seen.

For once, scientists weren't the oddball side characters bumbling around in lab coats (looking at you, Pacific Rim). Nearly every character was a scientist or engineer. Also, science wasn't some deus ex machina that the writer leaned on to solve problems. The problems that needed to be solved were the whole movie, and the audience member was left scratching their head just long enough to realize how fucked they would be if they were in his shoes, just before he comes up with a (relatively) plausible solution. Science wasn't portrayed as magic, just hard work, as it is in real life.

I really hope this movie inspires people to dream about space exploration. I know it's sort of terrifying and dangerous, but the movie did such a good job of portraying the base on mars I nearly forgot we hadn't actually gone there yet. Hope I live long enough to watch it happen in real life."
18,cvlalvt,The Elrond scene with Sean Bean in it was fucking gold. 
19,cvllrf0,"Loved the movie, as a book lover and engineer myself, I enjoyed the balance they struck between a mostly accurate scientific portrayal of the problems, respecting the book and trimming the fat for it to still work as a movie for everyone to enjoy.


*I understand why some elements had to be chopped out, namely many of the more science-heavy problems Mark faces:*

* Preparation for long journey is glossed over
* His drill doesn't short out the Rover
* Which leads to him still having comms on his journey to the MAV
* Which means the whole dust storm isn't a sensible obstacle
* No Toppled rover near the end of the journey either 

*Things that were changed that I appreciated:*

* There is only one rover to worry about
* Said rover has a trailer and a crane (making the Pathfinder recovery easier)...a sensible addition to the vehicle
* Although unrealistic, the Airlock is fast as hell
* No need to over-complicate rebuilding HAB after the explosive decompression
* **IRON MAN**
* Johannsen/Beck relationship downplayed enough to be subtle.
* Most of the casting was spot on. Kapoor was the only odd bit of racial-miscasting IMO.




*Things that were changed/removed that I didn't appreciate as much*

* Annie's role was relegated to audience surrogate for dumbing down the science. She has that role in the book somewhat, but also has the history making speech telling the world that Watney is in fact alive. That press conference doesn't even make the film and is implied to be a Teddy lead conference.
* Lewis going out instead of Beck. Each astronaut has their job, and although I understand the reasons behind her wanting to be the one to go out, it's just Hollywood fluff
* Vincent vs Venkat...why?




**I laughed out loud here though**

*Paraphrasing...*

Book: ""If this were a movie, everyone would be waiting in the airlock for high fives and greetings""

Movie: Everyone is just beyond the airlock waiting for greetings and high-fives...nothing to worry about with the whole depressurization of 75% of the ship...


I'm sure I could come up with a ton more things "
20,cvmgj8w,"i got a villanlike vibe from jeff daniels in the trailers so i was happy to see his character was just an asshole in the movie instead... 

the length of the movie and all the effort going into saving watney as well as the over all upbeat feel made it pretty clear that we wouldnt see one of the other astronauts die instead trying to save him or catastrophic failure   

also hans zimmer and interstellar ruined the intercept scene because i was expecting it to be 100x more dramatic"
21,cvl8xyp,"#IF YOU LIKED THE MOVIE, YOU SHOULD READ THE BOOK!

It's hilarious, and Weir put a ton of effort into making it as accurate as possible. It's definitely the best book I've read in a long time. It's not super expensive either; eBook copies are about $9, and physical copies are like $15. "
22,cvlal4q,"Donald Glover was hilarious and perfectly cast. 

Fun fact: Donald's slip and fall in the scene where he wakes up was for real and they decided to include it in the movie.

I lost it at the ""Council of Elrond"" aka the LOTR and Sean Bean/Borimir nod."
23,cvlr7cn,"Thought it was funny the Sean Bean basically got fired, basically as close to dying as he could get in this movie since he was never in danger of any real harm."
24,cvlb10q,"Of all the jokes they used from the book, they didn't use the boobies one.  It was so random in the book and I couldn't wait to see it on screen.  I pictured it flashing on the screen with everyone breaking out in hysterical laughter at his immaturity.  Kinda sad we just saw a weak reaction.  It's was a decent movie.  The audiobook is an absolute must if you like the movie.
"
25,cvlc0is,"I like how this movie ended up having parallels to ""Saving Private Ryan"", of all movies.

A team of 5+ risk their lives to rescue one of their own--Matt Damon."
26,cvtmblz,"They totally buried the lede in that first press conference.

""The team had to abort the mission because of a storm. They made it, oh except Watney, he died.""

What?? Maybe start out with... ""This is a dark day, we lost an astronaut...""

"
27,cvl8zxo,Just watched it. I loved the book. I liked the movie a lot. I am happy
28,cvljp6m,"Amazing movie except for the rescue attempt that they changed from the book. 

I'm really disappointed they had to ""Hollywood"" that ending. It makes no sense that Watney would get out of his seat. It makes no sense that the captain went out to get him instead of Beck. But ""she left him and dammit she's gonna get him back!"" And the whole Iron Man thing. Absurd and nonsensical. 

Amazing movie otherwise. "
29,cvl9ytt,"I really liked how faithful to the book it was, although I feel it made it slightly awkward at times where they ripped a line straight from the book that would have been better taken out or modified slightly (I think the biggest one, even though it was a small line was Vogel talking about the email he received with the new trajectory).

Also one of the biggest departures, basically how nothing goes wrong after the airlock explodes the Hab, especially that he doesn't lose contact with NASA again, made his pirate line a little weird, because he could get explicit permission to board the MAV. And the ""Iron Man"" scene was actually just stupid.

Overall though, I really enjoyed it, loved the emotion when he made contact with pathfinder and when they rescued him"
30,cvpkw2s,"So I see this post is already 3 days old but I just saw The Martian and really wanted to chime in with my opinion somewhere, even though it's not likely to be seen.

This is my first time writing a movie response on this sub so I'm just winging it, forgive me if I have any glaring gaffes.

Okay, to start off, I read the book and really enjoyed it. I know this is a discussion about the movie but I think it's important contextually to know where my head was at coming in to the movie. My favorite things about the book were the characters (Watney especially) and the science. Pretty much all of the characters were likable and charming in some respect. Even foul-mouthed Annie left a warm and fuzzy impression on me. 

I will admit that some of the science was a little drawn out and started feeling textbooky but for the most part, it was like a series of riddles that had some ingenious solution and it's captivating to see how it was solved. What's more is that the explanations are, at once, complex but understandable. Hydrazine could be a made up thing for all I care but because of the well-crafted writing, I am able to understand the significance and context in which it is important.

My least favorite thing about the book is that Watney never really seemed to face any REAL challenge. Yes, that probably sounds crazy but bear with me: Watney is deserted on Mars with what we think is no hope of survival. Yet he always seems to have the tools and knowledge to come out unscathed (Seriously, even the gaping bloody hole from chapter 1 never gets mentioned again). Apart from one incident where he has a momentary ""tantrum,"" Watney is always optimistic and persevering. I quickly learned, while reading the book, that all the danger was an illusion. Watney never loses hope and while I think that's admirable, it made the story less gripping.

The book definitely reminded me of Michael Crichton's novels but without the danger and excitement. Imagine the movie Cast Away without the 'Wilson' scene. It's pretty hard to, right? The desperation, loneliness, and sorrow of his situation is so viscerally portrayed. It's an iconic movie moment, and I don't think The Martian has any of that. 

So now I'm blending movie and book which is fine, I guess, because they are indeed VERY similar. I won't bore anyone with the tired line of ""but that wasn't in the book!"" ....

....

Actually, I will. Because it's very much related to the last point I made.

The movie cut out a decent chunk of stuff but two scenes in particular only exacerbated the issue of Watney not facing enough challenge.

[Spoiler 1](#s ""Watney breaking the communication he had with NASA while drilling holes in his Rover. I think this was important because Watney really started to feel the weight of his loneliness after this happened."")

[Spoiler 2](#s ""Uhhh....the sandstorm and FLIPPING THE ROVER. His solution to the sandstorm was genius and the rover flipping would've been quite a marvel on the screen. I'm just surprised they didn't include this."")

The movie also downplayed a lot of the other Characters. Mindy in particular was a great character in the book with actual growth. She felt almost irrelevant in the movie. Similarly, Annie had pretty much none of her personal brand of hostility and charm. 

I think the movie also lost a lot of the ""Cool!"" factor by not really explaining the science behind some of Watney's decisions. Watching the movie was a bit like watching the book in that it just seemed like Watney had a cheat sheet for every possible problem he could face. The book felt better because Watney was humorously explaining the science behind some of his decisions (Like the night soil, for instance).   

Now, I know the overall tone of this response is negative but I did really enjoy both the book and the movie. In my eyes, though, they both had their letdowns and I think the movie's letdowns were often greater versions of the book's. 

If anyone bothered to read this whole thing, thanks! I know it's not likely to be seen but I wanted to write it anyway. 

[The Ending](#s ""The change to the ending was pretty dumb. I don't really mind Lewis replacing Beck but having Watney do the Iron Man thing was idiotic, in my opinion."")

31,cvlgmfa,I'm sad we didn't get to see (.)(.)
32,cvlft9j,"If I knew how attractive people at NASA are, I would have changed my career path years ago."
33,cvl9mjg,"Saw this last night and thought it was utterly fantastic. I think it's even better than the book. Every change made in the adaptational process was perfectly necessary, and made the movie better (with one exception). I definitely recommend the book none the less - I think it will make a great companion piece for people who saw the film first.

Matt Damon is great, and works well with the humorous tone of the project. The rest of the cast do a lot of great work, even if they are underused. 
The film works great on a visual level.

I'm mainly just really pleased to see something so optimistic. I enjoy watching Mark Watney succeed, which is why I appreciated the removal of some of the false-jeopardy that was in the book. 

Furthermore, I think this movie is going to do some great business. Possibly *Gravity* sort of numbers.  My theatre upgraded all screenings of The Martian for this week to their largest screen, and the screening before mine was completely full. My screening, a late night Thursday showing, was also about  80% full. Furthermore, Fox have really kicked up advertising (at least in Australia) over the last week. 
 "
34,cvlaudl,"I really liked The Martian, it's a great story and Matt Damon is fun to watch. I felt it was a little too talky- everything needed to be explained, and the movie just seemed to be afraid of long silences in general.  
  
The scene where Watney is counting potatoes, trying to ignore the barely-holding tarp during a storm, was well done. There was no cut to Damon speaking to the audience, ""If that tarp doesn't hold, I'm dead!"" The Martian needed more of that, Damon showing instead of telling."
35,cvldr5d,[deleted]
36,cvnj9o8,"Disappointed with how much they glossed over the rover engineering he did, including the power short ruining his comms, the sandstorm, the tipover, etc. If anything I think the botany accomplishments were small potatoes (GET IT?!) with how he basically made a mobile HAB and covered all the essentials (oxygen, water, power, food, storage, warmth, etc.). I know the movie couldn't cover EVERYTHING, but this was basically 5 minutes of movie. Besides that, loved the film."
37,cvlb0s0,"The Martian is definitely one of my favourite movies of the year (yay Ridley is back). The cinematography was amazing, and I typically don't like 3D but Mars looked really great in 3D (especially that opening shot). It was a simple story and that's why it worked so well. It relied upon the human drama instead of trying to make some grand, convoluted statement. Overall a really great movie, Damon was awesome and the entire cast is great!"
38,cvp1b70,I wish the movie included the part about Johannson being the only one to survive if the Rich Parnell resupply didn't work (because she would have to eat the other members on the Hermes). That's one of those scenes in the book where it really hits home how hard space travel can be. Also it would have led to Martinez's hilarious comment about who she would have eaten first - I bet Michael Pena would have nailed that line. 
39,cvxw4mc,"I absolutely loved it! I was on the edge of my seat the whole time and it makes me optimistic about future Mars exploration. I hope this is the world my kids will be living in. 

The best part: No tacked on, needless love story. No late 20's wife with an adorable little girl waiting at home who are the only reason he needs to survive. For them. None of that shit. 

There were two clichés that stood out though. Nothing that ruined the movie by any means but the whole ""Calculations Correct"" flashing on Donald Glover's screen and when Michael Peña said ""In English please"" after a bout of science jargon. "
40,cvl913u,Anyone noticed the references to Ridley Scott's earlier alien movies. The title fades in just like the Alien title and Mark Watney pulling out the rod in the beginning was reminiscent of the operation scene in Prometheus.
41,cvl9bp6,"Loved absolutely every minute of it! 
One thing I want to mention though - I was a bit unsure about Glover playing Rich Purnell at first as I imagined someone completely different as I was reading the book. but holy shit he was just amazing! "
42,cvnhe86,David Bowies' Starman was a great touch. I started busting a move in the theater.
43,cvl945k,"These are my thoughts about The Martian:

* I like story in The Martian because it is fairly grounded, the narrative goal is consistent, and it was executed nicely.
* I also like it because light-hearted movie. So most of the audiences keep engaged with the movie even though the subject is really sciency for some people.

* I think Ridley Scott did a job nicely in directing The Martian and I want to give thumbs up to Drew Goddard because he adapted a good source material into a smart and hilarious screenplay.

* I like Matt Damon as Watney because he is competent, funny, and witty. I think that makes his character likeable and makes people easily rooting for him throughout the movie.
* The entire ensemble cast was also great in The Martian, from the Ares III crew to the people back at NASA and JPL. I think they do not need their big moment in this movie but there are some details, scenes, and dialogues that help you to understand the personalities of each characters.  I think that makes the character development in this movie is fairly balance.
* I think the other actors and actresses who stands out besides Matt Damon in this movie are Jessica Chastain, Michael Pena, Kate Mara, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Donald Glover, and Jeff Daniels. I think the other actors and actresses in this movie also gave a good performance. I want to thank Ridley Scott for this. 

* One of the flaws in this movie is I wish that Kristen Wiig’s character is more profound in this movie as a PR director of NASA but I think she did a great job in her role

* The other flaw is from the visual perspectives, this movie did not offer something new but at the same time it is still pretty to look at. Especially the red dessert on Planet Mars.


My final words The Martian is a great movie because most of the entire ensemble cast gave a good performance from a smart and hilarious screenplay. This movie became one of my favorite movie in 2015 and my favorite theatre experience in recent years.

If I have to give the score to this move, I would give it around **8.0 – 8.5 out of 10**.

Side notes:

* [I disagree with Mark Watney ](#s ""because Disco Music is great in space."")

* [I think it is cute ](#s ""that Winter Soldier and Invisible Woman (Beck and Johanssen) have a baby together at the end of the movie."")"
44,cvn3o6v,"The ending though, Lewis stealing Beck's big moment! Ignoring the fact that Beck was EVA specialist and Lewis just wanted to make up for the fact she left him on Mars.... The whole fly-around-like-iron-man thing wasn't even a real plan and was so hollywood, ugh."
45,cvm796u,"**SPOILERS**

I appreciated the nod to the Challenger disaster. When the pod supply mission explodes during take-off the incident takes place at 1m 13s into launch. A time shared with Challenger. 

Digging a little deeper, the root cause of the explosion of the pod supply mission was because they skipped testing stages because ""nothing usually goes wrong"". This was the same NASA mentality that destroyed Challenger (and Columbia for that matter). 

I am very pro NASA for many reasons. Two which include technology development and the basic human instinct of exploration! But this was a firm reminder that management should not put politics before science. 

""For a successful technology, reality must take precedence over public relations, for Nature cannot be fooled.""

46,cvla1zr,I was happy to see so many lines in the film were practically word-for-word from the book. I did not expect the movie to be as great as it was!
47,cvme7lc,"I was a little let down. The movie was good, but not great for me. I thought it was all very pretty visually and I really really liked the interaction between crew members, I thought that was great a lot of the time, but the story was just meh compared to the book.

I completely understand why they made the changes they did but I think this story was better on paper. Anyway, I would recommend the movie, but I'd recommend the book 2x as hard.

Edit: I see a lot of people talking about the movie capturing the novel. I really don't think it did. I never felt like once that Mars was trying to kill Watney during the movie. The movie almost seemed to be more about the people on Earth and the Hermes rescuing him than him rescuing himself. In the book he is always fighting to survive and while you know he is going to you are still invested. I don't think the movie made me really care. 

Like I said up top, I understand why the changes were made but I don't think it captured the book the way I was hoping."

63,cvm1ffu,"Well you know he's not going to die twenty minutes in.  But cut to seven months later and he's suddenly pale and thin, covered in lesions?  The reality of his situation suddenly snaps into focus.  The fact that he's lost some of his humor too is also quite shocking.  Hard science fiction like this tends to be quite conservative with a ""Cold Equations""-style moral drama near the end.  These stories demand that we side with logic over emotion and sacrifice the few (sometimes against their will) in order to save the many.  It's a common enough trope that there's palpable tension in the third act that this might all be for nothing.  "
64,cvlhq3x,"To your last point, that is the flaw in almost all rescue movies. You know for a fact that they aren't going to kill of the guy the whole movie is about 40 minutes into a 2 1/2 hour film. It isn't until the end where there is an actual stake because then it seems reasonable that the character could potentially die. It was the same with Gravity for me."

78,cvlueqe,"YES! That scene plus the scene right before lift-off when he starts crying. You can feel his terror in both of those scenes. It's especially heart-breaking because he is such a positive character and so good at keeping his spirits up for survival that when he actually breaks down, you feel his pain.

I guess I'm used to badass Winter Soldier Sebastian Stan."
93,cvlczyh,I read the book because he was cast as Beck. And boy am I glad I did.
94,cvmkqnm,"> Sebastian Stan is an exceptionally handsome man.

He's handsome, but for some reason he looks perpetually sad to me."
95,cvlcgci,"Well said. I just finished the book last week so with everything fresh in mind I was thrilled with how well the tone was translated. This held especially true for Watney explaining how/why he was doing something and the calculations. It wasn't over complicated or brushed over but presented in a way that you understood the thought process. 

The way disco was interweaved throughout was also a nice touch.
"
96,cvm6uxi,I think the writer Drew Goddard should get a lot of credit for that too.
97,cvmk4t9,"I think this is one of the most faithful book-to-movie adaptations I've ever seen. Sure, they take out a lot of things, they have to, it's a 141 minute movie. But as far as I could tell, they really only *changed* a couple of minor things, and those things were really only to explain some of the things they had to skip over.

The main example I can think of right now being that Commander Lewis went out to grab Mark instead of Beck, who did it in the book. Not a big deal though. Also, from the book I had the impression that he brought Pathfinder inside the hab to take the pictures, but I might be wrong on that.

The tone of the movie is dead on, Matt Damon knocked it out of the park as Watney, and the rest of the cast was amazing as well.

In fact, the movie added something that I felt the book was lacking: an epilogue. Which was fairly short, sweet, and to the point.

Honestly, the only part that bugged me was how the pictures were transmitted from Pathfinder/Sojourner. Why would they come in the form of like 8 little pictures, scattered around, and then move themselves to the right place to form a weird, scattered, panoramic thingy? That was dumb, but literally everything else was awesome."

I thought immediately there is no way Matt Damon went from buff Watney pulling shit out of his abs to Machinist thin for 1 scene, so the body double route was the most sensible way to showcase that. After that initial seen the gauntness from his scraggly beard and makeup (I imagine) are enough to sell he's skinnier through the suit."
113,cvlky3w,"With Damon getting into Jason Bourne shape again, it was going to be tough to do. I appreciate that they showed it though."
114,cvluerg,"Matt Damon explained to Ridley Scott how they could accomplish skinny Watney for the second half.  Fat is far easier to put on than take off, so he would have to shoot the final scenes first and then put on weight to film the first half.  Ridley said, ""Nah, fuck that."""
115,cvmka04,"Also, he told martinez that he hadn't taken a shower in a year and a half; he was clearly shown getting out of one all skinny like you said in the HAB "

121,cvnhbeu,"I disagree strongly with your first point. I felt like Vogel was a walking charicature in the book. He seemed like a disconnected robot not a Astronaut who had endured the entire trip with his crewmates. (he is unusually formal during the rescue scene in particular by calling Beck ""Doctor"" etc). School children learn English in the first grade, an international Astronaut would have nearly perfect English imo and not use ""Ja"" randomly. 

source: German born, brought American gf to Germany, English spoken around her is always English only.


I was worried they would give him a typical German accent and especially considering Hennie is Norweigan (therefore doing the Hollywood fake accent). 

Overall I was impressed by how they handled each character in the film, besides maybe Pernell (seemed a bit overkill with how informal/rude he was).
"
122,cvn9lza,"There was one ""Mein Gott"" as well"
123,cvmi7sb,I never would have guess that he was German if it weren't for the German flag on his shoulder 
124,cvqz9z2,"> Vogel was not German enough. There was only like one discernible ""Ja"" uttered.

As someone who works with 3 German PhDs in Boston all the time, I've never heard a single fucking ""Ja"" uttered. Are they faulty or something?

Or do movies need to overdo stereotypes?"

133,cvlps3a,Irrfan Khan was supposed to play Kapoor but had to pull out three weeks before filming started. 
134,cvluzhw,"I have to disagree on Iron Man, it was absurd, and especially with only one hand, he would have just spun in circles until his pressure dropped.  It was only ever a joke in the book, and made the ending more 'hollywood action hero' than realistic like the rest of the science tried to be.  It's the only change in the movie I can't just gloss over as made to make the movie run better, and I think it was a negative change.

Edit: Note that I mean *actually doing* the iron man, which was a joke in the book that they all knew was completely silly, is absurd.  It should have stayed a joke so Beck could do something in the movie.

Also, pathfinder not dying makes the space pirate part not work too :)"
135,cvlswqv,"Re: Annie's role, I honestly like the way the movie handled her. Her main roles in the book were dumbing down the science (as you said) and giving speeches that frankly, she probably wouldn't be giving in real life. If there's a dead astronaut, it'll most likely be the director giving the speech, not the PR rep."
136,cvlqxda,"Was the Iron Man moment not in the book? If not, how did it go?"
137,cvnj659,"I wouldn't call his character an asshole, just a very big-picture, logical leader type who has people to answer to and greater responsibilities to carry out. The trailer depicted it almost like he completely gave up on Watney, but thankfully that wasn't the case - he still pushed hard to rush supplies to Watney and etc to lead to his eventual rescue, even though it failed. 

It's perfectly reasonable not to want to risk 5 lives to save 1 in that case. He made a great point that mistakes and tragedies in space block the development of space flight."
138,cvnjiln,"I was agreeing with every decision he made, so I guess that makes me an asshole too. "
139,cvl964g,"I'm currently reading the book now but I haven't finished it yet...despite that, I'm still seeing the movie tomorrow afternoon.

Sidenote: The book has the best opening line ever. "
140,cvlbbqa,"I guess I gotta be that guy to balance out the equation. 

The Martian is clearly Weir's first book. It suffers a lot from basic writing cliches. There's a whole lot of ""He said"" and then ""He said"" and then ""He said"". People are sparsely described and there is often a lack of ""place"" despite the setting being very important for the story. 

Those are the bad things. The goods things are that the science is very well done and the humdrum life of Watley on Mars is compelling.

So yeah, it suffers from some amateur writing and the sci-fi bog standard of ""protagonist faces problem, comes up with clever solution"", but it's fun to read through despite this. 

It's a short book, so go nuts. It wasn't a waste of time to read it."
141,cvlmf6g,Funny thing is that the LOTR nod is actually in the book! It's just coincidence that Sean Bean ended up in the movie.
142,cvlej69,So this is Glovers bleeding hand during the dinner scene moment.
143,cvlquxr,"Having him appear to be so perfectly mismatched against NASA really helped me believe they would kick him out and refuse the Rich Purnell Maneuver out of sheer disbelief even though the numbers were sound and the astronauts hadn't been asked if they were willing. If I were in that room, I'd be doing anything to bring Mark home. Who would I not listen to? The exact character Glover played.

I dunno. I haven't read the book. But some people think he was miscast, yet I believe the dynamic was estranged enough to have the effect of his character be believable."
144,cvlc8zv,to me Glover was the only casting choice I didn't like. He was trying SO hard to fit into that persona. 
145,cvlck5u,I think they referenced it when there was an awkward pause after Mark replied to NASA. 
146,cvldjgv,[deleted]
147,cvma0bj,"I have to disagree. Saving Private Ryan was about a group of random people who, for 3/4 of the story,  basically couldn't care less about saving Ryan and only through the act of doing so do they realise the value of their mission and start to buy into it. This story is about a close knit team who would willingly mutiny and sacrifice (potentially) their own lives without second thought to save their comrade. Quite a different set of attitudes and driving factors."
148,cvmgst3,"Also similarities to *Interstellar*, where Matt Damon also plays an astronaut stranded alone on a remote planet. "
149,cwal9ww,Agreed. The press conference as a whole was sadly unrealistic. Very emotionless and not delivered like you would expect from an agency that was trying to capture public support. 
150,cvmkve0,"On the other hand, they added an epilogue, which I thought the book really should have had."
151,cvlclm7,I think the movie would have lost too much tempo if they included the rollover scene/dust storm/losing communications. I loved it though. 
152,cvlakhk,"I loved the pirate line, it was great! My head cannon was that NASA just told him to get to the rover and start working, never saying that he could take possession of it. "
153,cvml9hf,"> And the ""Iron Man"" scene was actually just stupid.

Can't believe I had to get this far through the comments to see this. I enjoyed the book because it was fairly scientifically sound and realistic, they stayed faithful for that until the very end and then had to go Hollywood and have the captain save him and turn him into iron man."

Edit: Just left the theatre and thought it was fantastic! "
157,cvmjc66,Almost the entire book is logs of Mark explaining what he is doing. They actually cut out a lot of that. I also think it is necessary for the audience to understand some key plot points.  For example (SPOILERS) when he decides to make water. I had no idea it was possible to make water.  If he didn't explain it I would have no idea what was happening.
158,cvlgrh0,Too talky? Did you read the book?
159,cvmhakx,"Actually, in the vacuum of space, cold isn't something to worry about. Vacuums are just about the best insulators there are, because there is no way for conduction or convection to carry the heat away. Instead, there is only radiation, which transfers much less heat away. "

166,cvnk01i,"It wasn't that politics was put before science. It was that they had a very limited window to prepare the pod before launch to make the transfer window (i.e. the space alignment needed to get to him before starving). So something needs to change to get them the extra 15 days they need to complete the project. The pre-flight checks are tossed, with the acknowledgment that there is a 5% chance of it causing mission failure. Unfortunately it was a bad dice roll and they hit that 5%. However, in the book they literally had no other options, it wasn't a political decision, but a pragmatic one."

He just lost the ability to grow more food and at this point he's probably not sure he has enough food to survive.  Rationing and starvation will mean months of agony and a slow death.

I've been following his work for years (everything from Buffy to Cabin in the Woods to Daredevil) and I think he's got an incredible career ahead of him. The past year or so has been rough, he left some huge projects (including directing The Martian) to do his Sinister Six movie (which got canned due to Sony's deal with Marvel, by all accounts his script was incredible) so hopefully the critical success of The Martian opens more doors for him. I'd love for him to work with Scott again, Goddard would be perfect for Prometheus or Blade Runner and the two are a perfect match."

208,cvlf9vp,"YES!  This was the main point I brought out in [my review](http://www.eatyourcomics.com/2015/10/01/movie-review-the-martian/).  While the novel was a solid foundation, the film lived or died based on how well you could take a book that was half monologue and turn it into something watchable.  Goddard hit the right points and left out the stuff we didn't need to see.

My only beef with the whole film was that Goddard didn't start Watney out saying the same line that opens the book:  ""Well, I'm fucked.""  Real missed opportunity there."

253,cvnwvqs,"Iirc, in the book he only says hes Hindu,  but in the film he says his dad is hindu and his mom is baptist. I think this was the movies way of explaining why he's a black man, and they just made him play a half indian half black guy"
254,cvmh6bu,"I wonder if they changed his first name when they had to recast.  At any rate, Ejiofor was great in the role.   I can easily gloss over a change of ethnicity as long as it wasn't a major aspect of the book. "
255,cvmzwkk,It says a lot about known Indian actors that he was the only one I thought of when trying to figure out who would have made sense. Hopefully hollywood will branch out in the future.
256,cvlw2qi,"Definitely true since the space pirate bit only makes sense if he hasn't gotten permission to board the MAV. Permission he can't get if there is no 2 way  comm with NASA.  If pathfinder is alive then it makes no sense.

Although silly, I liked then showing the iron man bit. They played up the joke like in the book but followed up on it...otherwise the flowing the books climax it leaves Beck entering the capsule to get mark to be very uneventful. At least this way you can see Mark lose absolute control before getting a decent vector. 

Stupid Murph should've gone untethered though and catch Mark in his odd trajectory instead of sitting by more or less waiting for him to come to her."
257,cvn99hd,"The Iron Man scene was the only thing that disappointed me.  The book made such a strong point of making everything at least feasible from a reality/scientific standpoint, and this scene abandoned that and just served to add more faux-tension and a little comedy.  The scene already had gone to the limit of reality, with the perfect decompression giving them just enough thrust in the right direction to make it work, it did not need a complete suspension of belief.  This is a common mistake made when it comes to movie ""magic.""

With that said, overall, the move was fantastic, even if the book was better.  Could not imagine it being much better."
258,cvlv364,"I thought the movie would have been better if they had cut Annie completely. They should have just put her role in the book on Daniel's character (which they mostly did, anyway) and not include her just because she was in the book.

Book Annie was fun because she was foul-mouthed, to the point, and had an impact. Movie Annie looked perpetually confused and had like 5 lines. My biggest gripe with the movie is that there were too many characters for the length of the movie; cutting her would have helped keep the focus on important ones."
259,cvlrw1d,It wasn't. Beck pulls him out of the MAV and they are reeled in by Vogel. Watney doesn't even unstrap himself until Beck is in the MAV pulling him out. The book's ending was much less cowboy-ish.
260,cvlw7lk,"The request to be Iron Man is the same in the book, but Mark never actually does it. In fact he never unstraps from his seat until Beck fetches him. Pretty unsafe maneuver to sit in the door honestly. "
261,cvlciuf,"My problem with the book is the sense of false-jeopardy, especially in later chapters. The rover journey felt so rote and monotonous in the novel. 

Luckily the film got rid of most of this, a change  I appreciate immensely. "
262,cvm7ww8,3rd book actually.
263,cvmgxq3,"not his first book
"
264,cvllwpz,"Out of everything and anything, you single out 'said'? There is nothing wrong with 'said'. 'Said' is simple. It is unobtrusive. It is one of the greatest words in the English language.

The only thing better than 'said' is dialogue attribution through action tags, or else implying who is speaking through context and not attributing at all. Otherwise, you're using adverbs (FUCK ADVERBS) or you're using a thesaurus when all you want to say is 'said'. And that gets old fucking quickly.

Good writers use 'said'. Bad ones dance around it like fairies. "

269,cvldovi,Some parts I felt like he was doing his Abed impression.
270,cvldzj7,"He was *okay*. Not terrible by any means, but his character was so cartoon-y. He just showed up for a couple scenes, gave the important characters the solution, and left."
271,cvldq9f,"Only scene I didn't like was the sound effects with bodies acting as planets, but that rang to me as directing, not Donald. I'm not sure anyone could make that idea work on screen. "
272,cvlewms,Yeah i felt like he played it wayyyy too far over the top
273,cvmirru,I did like the part where he asked  Teddy  his  name though.
274,cvlfa4m,"Definitely. They just didn't show it in screen. For people who haven't read the book you are lead to assume it was just something crass but for the book readers, we know exactly what it was :)."
275,cvnvkru,"I don't think that was the part where he sent boobies via text. At that part in the movie he was pretty angry that they hadn't told the crew yet. In the book I remember it just being a regular conversation where they remind him they're broadcasting, and he sends boobs as a joke. I don't think he would have sent a boob joke when he was angry though to say 'fuck' because they hadn't told his crew he was alive. So basically I believe they left the boobs joke out entirely, which is a shame."
276,cvn2bj8,well you forgot that one of them takes place in SPACE
277,cvnhss1,"The book did have a sort of epilogue that was removed in later publishing. 

http://www.goodreads.com/topic/show/1815563-spoiler-thread-the-martian

> Leaving the pizzeria he sat on a public bench just outside. Next week would be busy. He'd be meeting the Aries 6 engineer. He'd read her file but never met her in person. He wouldn't get much time to relax after that.

>The following six weeks would be filled with constant training, as he tried to impart as much knowledge as he could, but that was something to worry about later. Right now he took a deep breath of the fresh air and watched the people walk by.

>“Hey, I know you!” said a voice from behind. A young boy had strayed from his mother. “You're Mark Watney.”

>“Sweetie,” his mom said, embarrassed. “don't bother people like that.”

>“It's okay” Watney shrugged.

>“You went to mars,” the boy said.

>“sure did, almost didn't make it back”

>“I know,” said the boy, “that was awesome!”

>“Sweetie,” his mom scolded, “that's rude.”

>“So Mr. Watney,” the boy said, “if you could go to mars again, like if there was another mission and they wanted you to go would you go?”

>“Watney scowled at him. “You out of your fucking mind?”

>“Okay, time to go,” the mom said, quickly herding the boy away down the crowded sidewalk.

>Watney snorted in their direction. The he closed his eyes and felt the sun on his face. It was a nice, boring afternoon."
278,cvnhgrj,"Honestly Not having read the book when i saw it I thought the epilogue was going to be.

And so Watney returned to earth, where he promptly died of cancer from sitting next to the radioactive core that he dug up"
279,cvnkatd,"Super agree with the epilogue. I put down the book thinking it was about 20 pages short when I finished it. It could have even been condensed to 10. I wanted to read about him stepping foot onto Earth for the first time,  see his parents,  and I also felt contact between him and Kapoor would have been important."
280,cvnvnla,"To each their own I guess. I thought the epilogue was superfluous and shouldn't have been in the movie. Watney looked like he aged 10 years while the rest of the people didn't age at all (well, Wiig's character looked older too). I thought the movie should have ended with him reuniting with the crew and that slow pan out to space."
281,cvle90r,"Any any book adaptation, some things have to be cut, so losing the rollover and likely the dust storm is fine (even though the dust storm issue is one of my favorite segments of the book). I do wish, however, that they had included the loss of communication with NASA. The emotion of being cut off again would have been great, made all the better when he does reconnect with them in the MAV. "
282,cvlds8t,"I completely agree with this, the film did not suffer from losing that dust storm  scene at all. I think it would have been too much for the film, I was actually my least favourite part of the book too, I just felt here we go again, and it felt like piling on a bit too much bad luck when the end was in sight.

I saw the film last night and loved it, but I would not have harmed it to be 30 mins shorter IMO."
283,cvlega3,"I just liked the idea that Watney was so bored and intelligent that he spends half the movie musing on the technicalities of what he's doing and making those funny observations.

Maybe there will be a DVD extra that is just his video logs. That'd be neat."
284,cvncvx2,Sick Total Recall reference man.
285,cvmis39,"I guarantee this is news to the Audiobook listeners..

In the audiobook, the narrater just childishly yells ""Boobies!""

Also, the spelled out transmissions through pathfinder is not fun to hear. "
286,cvlbk29,"Yeah, sure. 

Broadly speaking, there is less quantitative technical detail in the film. In the book Mark goes through a lot of the things he does using actual numbers and values. He calculates the number of litres of water he can make, the amount of potatoes he can grow with the space that he has, he even creates his own unit of energy called the pirate-ninja to make his final rover journey easier.  This level of quantitavie detail is absent in the film, although there is still a very high level of qualitative detail.

There are a few minor changes to Mark's character. He swears a lot more in the book. He is also a botanist and a mechanical engineer in the novel. He might still be a mechanical engineer in the film, although he only ever claims to be a botanist. 

He gets into far less trouble in the movie than he does the book (this is what I appreciated most about the adaptation).  The book was written as a serial, with chapters being released on Andy Weir's website periodically. It means that the book falls into this kinda crappy rhythm where at the end of every chapter Mark falls into some sort of great peril, and he manages to get out of it fairly inconsequentially.  A lot of his escapes are much less interesting than the problems he solves earlier on. 

The film dispenses with most of this false jeopardy, a change I appreciate a lot. 

The biggest change, and the only change I didn't like, comes in the climax. Spoiler tags from here on:
[Climax Spoilers](#s ""In the novel, Watney suggests the 'Iron Man' technique, which the crew dispense as stupid and tell him not to do it. They use this as inspiration to blow the airlock. This brings them close enough so that Beck can rescue Mark. The same thing occurs in the movie; Mark suggests the idea, which the crew dismiss, they blow the airlocks. However, they're still some distance from Watney. He decides to use the 'Iron Man' technique to get himself to Commander Lewis, who has taken Beck's role"")

Edit: When I wrote this I thought that you hadn't read the book, but judging by your other comments, it seems that you have. Reading back, it kinda makes this reply look dickish and condescending. I apologize for being a bit of a nob."
287,cvltfey,"Was gonna say, him using humor to keep himself sane and his spirit at least somewhat up was a huge part of it."
288,cvmzdpz,🎵 Troy is Abed in the moooooovie. 🎵
289,cvlhoow,"Seriously. I don't get why they had her character in the film. All she does the whole movie is stand in scenes where a PR person would never be at and not say anything of any use. It isn't Kristen Wiig's fault, but that was my biggest complaint of the movie. For someone that has read the book is her character more prominent in that?"

291,cw1ti9s,Those are the best odds I've had in years.
292,cvyfefs,"Cool to know because that line wasn't in the book and it was a really good line!

Also cool - TIL there's a Marco Polo series!"
293,cvoiib2,Yep! We're filming season 2 in Malaysia as we speak
294,cvmzrpe,"It's good but it's nothing like game of thrones. So far (I'm not up to date) it's about the power dynamic between the probably the most powerful man who ever lived and his strange mix of whims and interests and the Marco Polo's relative powerlessness. I'm not crazy about the Chinese stuff, particularly the fighting, it's too crouching tiger and jarring in the realistic, historical context of the show."
295,cvsvybz,"You have to admit that Donald Glover's character sorta was a science guy trope.  The most scientifically inaccurate thing about the movie was treating the idea of a gravity assist as some really foreign idea and the childlike explanation he gives the *head of NASA* and a group of *JPL Engineers!* I think the conversation would pretty much be: ""How about a gravity assist by slingshot around earth?"" ... ""like we did around the moon, a hundred times""... ""yep""."
296,cvmwx01,There was a guy behind me who said that that one rocket failed because it was probably made in China (because of the actor being Asian). Then when the actual Chinese saved their asses he stopped talking for the entire movie.
297,cvlu6p8,I had the same thought because he's the only scientist in the movie that doesn't look like a model.
298,cvqyiqr,"I think the big difference here is we see NASA actively doing everything they can to bring this guy home. In Castaway they give up on finding him and he is completely alone which totally changed the tone of the film. Similarly in Gravity, once she looses Kawalski she's basically alone as well. No communication with NASA, she also almost gives in a few times."

One minute.  They mentioned earlier that you'd die from decompression in about a minute on mars."
306,cvlzrpe,"I was expecting him to stop counting, put his suit on and then start counting potatoes again as a ""just in case""."
307,cvm9iny,"I'm relatively certain they explain this in the book.  Pretty much any time anything bad happens, Watney explains why it's bad and what his options are."
308,cvmqwbm,"That scene really got me. Like he was so overwhelmed with emotion that he was *finally* getting rescued, if anyone didn't feel for him before, that scene guaranteed you did now."
309,cvn317v,Do you have a link to this interview?
310,cvnit9c,I think it was both. Like so close yet so far.
311,cvmbmt9,"Pretty sure he said ""in gerund form"" as in ""fucking,"" but I could be wrong."
312,cvm1qme,"In the book he just said ""look  ---> a pair of boobs ( . Y . )""

Or something along those lines"
313,cvllq2z,"I'm talking about the two that they did allow. Mark's first words on screen after being left there and realizing his situation (""FUCK""), and later the ""Fuck you, Mars.""  
  
Felt like if they only had two F-bombs to work with, they picked when and how to use them very well"
314,cvlpqcf,I imagine that it's because they knew it was being broadcast live worldwide - better to add a background program to censor the messages than deal with people complaining about the language.
315,cvnzkgk,"So I saw it today in theaters. When we got to this scene, a bunch of people with flashlights came into the theater. Movie paused, lights came on. Theater staff asked if there were any medical professionals present. 

I waited a minute for anyone to step up and then I did. 20yo kid a few seats behind me was laying in the aisle puking and dizzy. Parents said the auto-surgery scene probably set him off. Waited with them until medics arrived. I guess the scene was pretty intense!"

319,cvlgwei,"I think saying the F word in that tense would have gotten it an R rating. It's ridiculous, but the way in which you use it can determine the rating. "
320,cvohuqn,Also loved the similar back and forth of the guy testing the drill holes on the rover roof.
321,cvmdw0z,"Loved that sequence, because they let you figure it out on your own.  About halfway through, I realized where he was headed, and was happy they didn't just say it out loud."
322,cvmkolo,"I would love a Director's Cut with those lines added in, and maybe even add the stuff toward the end with Watney losing comms and getting stuck in the dust storm.

The only other changes that stood out to me as negatives (though not egregiously so) were having Lewis fetch Watney instead of Beck, having Watney actually do the iron man thing, and the epilogue. I much prefer the book epilogue (Watney to kid: ""Are you out of your fucking mind?!"") to the movie epilogue (Watney teaching astronaut trainees).

Overall, I thought it was a very solid adaptation and also a very solid movie in its own right. Good pacing, good cinematography, good screenplay, good acting. Probably Scott's best since the 90s, with the possible exception of the extended Kingdom of Heaven."
323,cvmittv,"What I'd give for a ""Fuck me raw"""
324,cvmsw2w,Yeah that's a big thing I noticed too. Her character was reduced to pretty much just a few reaction shots.
325,cvogq6b,"She basically got to stand in the back and make scared/serious faces. All the press stuff was done by Daniels and Ejiofor, when I thought it would be pretty easy to just let her do a few of the press releases, if timing was the issue :/

326,cvltrx6,"I'm glad they resisted the urge to pair Mark up with Lewis or Johanssen for some ridiculous romantic plot.  The movie is still a love story, it's just between one man and the whole world.  "
327,cvlqr1l,"It wasn't even obvious in that scene. If you didn't know the book, it could have just come across as a sending-you-off-to-battle non-relationship cheek kiss.

328,cvlmjj9,It gets everywhere. 
329,cvmjf64,"Movie skipped over a few minor disasters, and them catching mark in space was modified. Also they added the earth stuff after he was saved"
330,cvmjl3c,"Spoilers obviously, but the most notable was the brevity on Mark's trip from the HAB to the MAV. In the book he loses all communication with NASA just before setting out, then has to get out of a Martian sandstorm before losing the sunlight to power his rover.

Then there's also... Iron Man. He doesn't actually puncture his suit in the book, they just tell him ""that's a bad idea"" and leave it be. 

I have to admit, both changes made for a better movie!"
331,cvr1fdc,"For anyone wondering, he essentially couldn't do it because the Hab is designed to block radiation, which would include radio transmissions. "
332,cvo78rf,I think they filmed that but cut it out. He's pretty bruised up when he get's to the MAV. It would hopefully be in an extended edition of the movie when it comes out on Blu Ray.

363,cvnxza0,"I think it's no coincidence that the disaster occurs on the third mission to Mars, just enough times for the whole thing to seem routine.  There are five planned mission to Mars with talk of a sixth if they get the proper funding.  We landed on the moon six times (it would have been seven if not for Apollo 13's 'successful failure').  "
364,cvni41n,The Council of Elrond scene is so legendary. I love it so much.
365,cvp4lkr,"For me it was a more significant change because I listened to the audiobook and the voice actor did a wonderful Indian accent for Kapoor, made him one of my favorite characters. Still enjoyed the film immensely."
366,cvlwj67,"The problem I have is it just doesn't even look vaguely real.  He's jetting along with one arm out, but going in a straight line, and moving way, way too fast for his suit pressure.  It was great played up as a joke, and opened up for Lewis's ""Wait, what does this say, Oh, it says I'm the captain' line.  The way it played out in the movie is just so 'wrong' looking with any thought to movement in freefall, and it makes Lewis look like she doesn't know what she's doing with the pack either (she would know how long the tether was at the start), hence Beck going untethered in the book to make the last of the distance and speed up.

It also takes out the only thing of consequence Beck does in the whole story.

 They had a bit of the same problem with the wire stunts for the freefall movements in the ship, we have so many video feeds and clips from the astronauts on the ISS, that it is *really* obvious when you move in a way that doesn't make sense (like 'falling' around the corner of the corridors all the time in the movie).  Would have been nice if they could have vomit-cometed those scenes to make them look right, or at least had the crew actually pull themselves around the corner."
367,cvld7bb,"> The rover journey felt so rote and monotonous in the novel.

I think that's kinda the point. Many other survival stories gloss over or fast forward through the boring parts (The Way Back, Cast Away). They yada yada yada over the essence of the story, which is the difficulty of the will overpowering the monotonous struggle of putting one foot in front of the other, again and again.

The best movies cover this (All is Lost is a great example), but The Martian film chose to skip a lot of the moments in The Martian book where Watney despairs and then overcomes. That's unfortunate in my opinion, the movie could have been so much more.

**Important note:** I just remembered the line from the book ""It was a ridiculous sequence of events that led to me almost dying and an even more ridiculous sequence of events that led to me surviving."" In my opinion the movie removes a lot of those minutia which removes the ridiculousness of him surviving which lessens the emotional impact we get of him overcoming.  "
368,cvlujsa,"Yeah, I believe Stephen King says in On Writing that your dialog should be getting across the tone of how the character is talking, not adverbs. I agree that sometimes the writing in The Martian is amateurish, but it only makes me more excited to see Weir grow as a writer. It's a fantastic read. "

edit: accidentally a word"

382,cvlbzqt,"Thanks for your response! No worries about your in-depth explanations, I'm sure it'll help others looking for info who haven't read the book. I'm sad that it sounds like they removed some of the science-y stuff, but it's pretty much what I expected.

One last question: Do they go into the chemical process of Watney creating water?

Anyways, it sounds like the substance of why I loved the book will still be in the movie."
383,cvlj5j0,"Her character is prominent in the book, but neutered completely in the film. In the book she is a cold 'bitch' and every other word she says is 'fuck' or some derivation of it. In the movie they made her far too sympathetic."
384,cvzlvbv,That's just Hans Zimmer falling asleep on his keyboard.
385,cw2p6ky,"Found the guy that saw Interstellar more than a few times. Don't worry, right there with you. "
386,cvoksyt,Seeing him in the film reminded how excited I am for your Season 2 work!
387,cvt3cfl,"He was, I'm not saying that he wasnt, just that it was only him. It wasn't a big room full of nerds, it was varied and reflective of the scientists I've met. 

Regarding the gravity assist, that should be known to them, however thesemanagement guys are career bureaucrats, rather than the practising scientists. It's likely they spent the last 10-20 years looking at spreadsheets of expenses much more than data. Also the manoeuvre was done by a constantly accelerating ship, so is not really a conventional Hohmann elliptical transfer or a purely gravity slingshot. In reality it would take advantage of something called the obereth effect, where the faster a ship is going (being closer to the earth) the more impact full the thrust is on the trajectory. On top of that the trajectory takes into account full N-body effects, which are not so easily explained. I think there is plenty there that has to be explained to them, and justifies that scene being there, even if it isn't as complicated. 

At the end of the day however, it's a film, and the simple visual demonstrations are necessary for the viewing public that aren't scientists. They could have just shown a picture of Wier's simulation (which I think was actually in the background of purnells office), or drawn it on the blackboard. But that wouldn't be memorable or have the humour from Purnell obliviousness to Ted's position as head of nasa. "
388,cw7gxmc,"> the childlike explanation he gives the *head of NASA* and a group of *JPL Engineers*

Kristen Wiig, the media relations person, was also in the room."
389,cvy2xe6,"That felt alot like it was for the mass audience's benefit.  Although they may just say ""Why not a gravity assist?"" in reality, good film-making walks that line where they keep it attainable to a large audience, but still throw in goodies for those who know what they are talking about.  At least they didn't go into a full Doc Brown explanation on anything because the audience couldn't keep up :)..."
390,cw8obw7,"Normally those kinds of scenes annoy me (""Smart guy dumbs things down for other smart people, but really they are dumbing things down for the audience""), but Glover told sold it for me.

I bought that he was completely underslept, completely maniacally obsessed, and also clueless (like not knowing who the head of NASA was). I didn't need Kapoor clicking the pen off Kristin Wiig's head because he *would* know who he was talking too, but Glover's behavior did not ring false to me"
391,cvn0hiu,Haha. That's amazing. Dickhead. 
392,cvpt6j4,Especially since legally I believe almost all rocket parts are made in the US (except for those pesky super Russian rockets used by ULA).
393,cvv37at,Who even says that stuff anymore when just about every electronic we use daily comes from China?
394,cvpqm60,He'd pass out before he died though.
395,cvmi9em,Well Mark probably learned the German word from Vogel.
396,cvmmosd,"I heard gerund also, and as a grammar nerd, I loved that."
397,cvm5v3x,I really wish they had put that in the movie.

399,cvlrq6n,"I kind of wished they used his ""Fuck you, Mars"" when he was about to be rescued by Hermes like they did in the book, but yeah overall was very well done."
400,cvmbmtw,"I was hoping they'd keep at least his original line from the book when he was asked to censor himself - instead of cursing (like the movie) he said ""Look! Boobs! ( . Y . )"" "
401,cvn969k,"I really missed the fact that they didn't have Watney short out pathfinder and lose comms again. I wanted to see Nasa be confused about the bedroom, as well as Watney doing more independant work. I also would have liked to see the rover accident."
402,cvnb6by,"I hear that the book actually cut out the epilogue that Andy Weir originally wrote, and I can't find anything about Watney talking to a kid at the end. My copy ends when he's onboard the Hermes, and I can't find the original epilogue anywhere, do you know if I can read it still?"
403,cvq8hbt,"I liked Lewis getting Watney, though maybe could have done without the spinning part.  It all made for a nice story arc for her character.  Beck getting him back doesn't really mean anything, whereas Lewis doing it resolves the personal guilt and professional responsibility of leaving Watney behind.  It wasn't much, but I appreciated that tiny bit of progression and how organic it was without interfering at all with the primary plot."
404,cvo26ap,">having Lewis fetch Watney instead of Beck

The moment she left the bridge, I thought ""Oh noooo...  That wasn't in the novel.  She's gonna die..."""
405,cvmbr9u,"They took that plot point from the book. Lewis expressly forbids relationships along the crew, but one forms anyway (they're together for more than three years... What'd she expect?). Watney was unattached. "
406,cvltada,"No, because their was that moment when they locked eyes as he was space walking. It established there was something there. The kiss sealed it. Oh, and the baby. "
407,cvmefvk,"It's coarse, rough, and irritating. "
408,cvndo2l,I think the epilogue capped if off nicely.
409,cvnfx4d,"Driving to the MAV was a big part of the book. I was surprised they left out pretty much all of it in the movie. Maybe they deemed all the issues he ran into ""over the top"", so they kept it out to make it more plausible. 

Still really enjoyed the movie though."
410,cvwbndh,Not to mention it wouldn't fit through the airlock.
411,cvlsvse,"It's such a minor character that the Director of NASA would have to be quite familiar with the book series in order to namedrop him, which implies that NASA is Tolkien nerds all the way down.  "
412,cvldh4z,"I just wasn't expecting it. 

Glorfindel is one of my favourite characters from Tolkien mythology and I would have assumed they were referencing the films (in which Glorfindel played such a minute and insignificant role)."
413,cvmbfam,"Glorfindel is one of the book characters present at the council of Elrond that is not there in the movie. He's also a total badass...but does not participate in the final decision. I saw it as a nod to the LOTR books, as well as a notification that he isn't going to have anything to do with the decision in the end (the way the Rich Parnell maneuver was done without his consent). "
414,cvmbrgi,"Pretty much the same reaction here. The laughter had died down after the Council of Elrond description, but as soon as Daniels said that I erupted. Kudos to whoever decided to put that one in. "
415,cvlbrww,"I didn't think of that. Mostly because I made sure to avoid the trailer after I saw it once, so it didn't even register it was a trailer joke."
416,cvls4dl,"Sean Bean is actually incidental to the joke, the council of Elrond meeting joke is in the book too."
417,cvly7ng,"I forgot it was even in the book and didn't connect it until that scene. I started cracking up immediately, a few seconds later I heard a bunch of people go ""OHHH"" and everyone started laughing too."
418,cvpjeex,"I went back and read the applicable page. Teddy doesn't have any proof of Mitch's mutiny, and without that proof he can't fire Mitch without revealing the mutiny to the public (""which will make us look like idiots"").

Teddy says if he does find any proof then he'll definitely fire Mitch, but the implication is that he won't. He doesn't actually know how Mitch got the info to the Hermes, he just guessed that Mitch was responsible, confronted him, and Mitch obliquely admitted it verbally."
419,cvleayq,Friends and I have a game where we depict the Nick Fury recruitment scene after **every** movie.
420,cvlxnz7,"There was. Wasn't in the movie, though."
421,cvlwrbe,"The book had a proper hab patch kit and high strength adhesive, all supplied in case the real mission had a breach or leak, not a sheet of poly."
422,cvukp4q,Literally scurvy.

424,cvmic6a,"And it wasn't even anything complicated it was just like ""I have to change the code"""
425,cvmk80p,"First line of the movie I would cut, no way his character is that dumb.

"
426,cvn3k1l,"Lol I was so disappointed in that line considering they're all god damn ***astronauts***

I mean I know it's to explain to an audience who might not get it but yeah that's such a shitty irritating sci-fi cliché line"
427,cvmhami,That was the only line where I shook my head. I thought all the dialogue was really solid otherwise. 
428,cvmoe7o,"I thought it was perfectly understandable, actually."
429,cvljk3n,"It's actually not in the book, but lots of people think it is. [We had a little discussion of it on the The Martin subreddit a while back](https://www.reddit.com/r/themartian/comments/3gji1n/science_the_shit_was_anything_like_that_found_in/).

But I agree, it totally suits the tone of the book."
430,cvlw3nv,"I can't imagine not liking that line. It didn't get laughs in the theater, because it was in the trailer, but when I first heard it in the trailer I was delighted. I can't conceive of a reason that line isn't pro-science. It's exactly pro-science. He's literally saying that science is going to save his life, and he's excited about it despite things being grim."
431,cvlrtrz,"Having read the book immediately before watching the trailers, 'science the shit out of this' was actually the only thing in the trailers that jumped out at me as being completely different than the book, all the rest of the scenes, while cut in wrong order in the trailer, fit up to scenes in the book.  I assumed it was to get some attitude into the movie without 'fuck'ing up the rating :)"
432,cvnml86,"I liked that they portrayed them as humans and not ultra-strict super serious characters only focused on the task at hand. They joked around and had fun, just like normal people do. Mark especially saw the humour in an insane situatuon, there is nothing wrong with that."
433,cvlzzx0,Agreed that Beck is made to be completely useless with Lewis taking the reigns. And the sarcastic captain line would've been interesting. 
434,cvldche,"As your important note mentions, the rover journey is not boring because nothing happens. It is boring because lots of things happen that have no consequence. "
435,cvmjv7y,"I understand why they cut it shorter, but I really wish they'd been able to keep the bit about his meal marked ""survivied some shit that should have killed me"""
436,cvmhq7h,I like how he hates adverbs ending in -ly.
437,cvo3r5m,"maybe if I do this, it will solve everything!"
438,cvmh0uy,That's what a steely eyed missile man does.
439,cvlwhzt,"Oh perhaps if it wasn't also combined with an ""awkward nerd tells people to do things with no explanation"" thing. I get that his immediate boss would tolerate that, but the director of NASA before he's even proven he's worth listening to was a stretch for me."
440,cvmchun,Calling the President to apologize for Watney swearing when the entire world is reading. 
441,cvlcaq0,"They do go into the chemistry of creating the water. In fact, the technical detail of this section is mostly preserved - more so than any other part of the book. 

Don't be sad. It's all still there, just in a quantitative, more palatable for general audiences kind of way. That's why I recommend the book as a companion piece to the film - it has everything the film has, but with numbers!

I still thought the film was fantastic, and I'm one of those people that thought the novel should have had in-text equations and code blocks.  
"
442,cvmgb1j,Sounds like she was the victim of the MPAA.
443,cvufhsc,"Very true; the tropes were nowhere near *Armageddon* level. Just that one stuck out to me. As long as nobody says anything along the lines of ""(X) is scientifically impossible... that movie is bullshit"", then my head won't explode with rage. Right there with you; it's a damn movie under the category of *Science Fiction*..."
444,cvmwy2k,"I've been thinking. How the heck would he have used fuck in gerund form? Obviously he could have used ""Fucking"" as an exclamation, but unless he's using it as a noun, isn't it not technically a gerund?"
445,cvmglfq,You can't put boobs in a rated PG-13 movie! 
446,cvlxzns,"Or at the end when the kid asks if he'd ever go back to Mars and he said, ""You out of your fucking mind?""."
447,cvmfokr,"I liked the mystery, especially when the president calls Teddy afterwards. Text based boobs probably wouldn't be enough to get a call from the president.

A pissed off bitter Watney who was just told to cool it with cursing leads to any number of possibilities. It still got a huge laugh from the audience."
448,cvoiw5u,"I would have been happy for another half hour on this film. For the amount of time he was there, it didn't feel like it. I want more!"
449,cvncqla,"Weir posted the cut ending on here a while back, Watney talking to the kid is not in the book as far as I know."
450,cvma6eh,31 seconds of screen time devoted to this romance.
451,cvmlun6,That was his baby? holy crap I totally missed that
452,cvne3m8,"Yea thought it was fine, just mentioning that it wasn't in the book"
453,cvoi64y,"I agree with their decision to cut past some stuff, but I actually did sort of miss the slow pace at some parts of the book. But it would be hard to do and keep the movie interesting."
454,cvmij0e,Except their PR people.
455,cvml4a9,all the way up
456,cvnfxnf,"Include that the ""Zork 2"" and ""Leather goddesses of Phobos"" references. Infocom forever !"
457,cvtl32g,"6 days late but I *loved* how casually he dropped that.  He's such a humorless dick the entire movie, but he's a nerd just like the rest of them!"
458,cvlk9gg,So insignificant that he wasn't in the films at all
459,cvle29h,"Yeah, it was 100% this. Everyone's heard that line 20 times in previews by now. "
460,cvmq5pe,Still a funny coincidence. 
461,cw8nzz9,"Which is why the Movie version actually makes sense as the most plausible outcome. 

Teddy has no evidence that Mitch did it. But Teddy knows that Mitch did.
And Mitch knows that Teddy knows. 

So Mitch resigning is honestly the only reasonable move because, coward or not, Teddy made a call that could be argued was the right conservative bet from his position as head of NASA. And, hero or not, Mitch broke Teddy's trust, and set a precedent that should not be encouraged.

It's a shame, but that's just how things work in the real world: Everyone does the right thing, everything works out for the best, but someone still has to make a sacrifice. Ultimately, the Ares crew and Mark Whatney know what Mitch did (they would figure it out once they talk to Vogel's wife), and that matters most."
462,cvlowyk,Fingers crossed for Star Wars.
463,cvnutvt,"Did you come up with one for Straight out of Compton? I'd imagine it would be him walking up to some skinny white kid in Detroit and going ""We need to move, you've got an appointment with the *doctor*"""
464,cvmgw3i,"Would have taken up too much time to explain it, when duct tape serves the same function, is universally understood, and has added comic value. "
465,cvmjls2,"I was also surprised by the lack of resin to fix his helmet.

I think duck tape made for a better visual though so I understand the swap."
466,cvuonev,Well he is a pirate.

470,cvm90y9,When you have a line in the movie that most of the readerbase believes was actually in the book -- You've nailed the tone to a tee. 
471,cvm0yzp,"He then literally goes on to do actual science: testing the rover to see how he can extend it's range.

In fact: the next scenes are exactly about him performing experiments with the rover.  I don't know why anybody wouldn't like this."
472,cvm4coy,"Yeah. I just read the book the last few days and this was definitely a gripe I had. 

*Mark Watney faces a problem that seems critical

*Mark Watney solves problem

*Watch out Mark, things are going bad for you again

*Mark: lol, fuck you Mars

This pattern continues throughout the entire book. He never really seems in danger, though you should be terrified for him. I think if the author explored the setting a little more in each scene, it could be a more engaging experience. 

"
473,cvmjmlq,He said tersely. 
474,cvohwdb,I feel like the director of NASA's been through a lot and sees a lot of eccentric behaviour
475,cvmkgj5,"It's more palatable for general audiences, but at the same time, they don't treat us like idiots. They use terms that we don't know, and they don't explain them, because we can figure them out from context.

Usually movies and TV shows have one character that is ""the new guy"" that all of the other characters will explain things to, essentially being the reason that things need to be explained, which then benefits the audience. Most of the time, this means characters will explain some complex science thing with a really, really, mind-bogglingly dumb analogy, they are saying it to the character, but they are saying it for our benefit. It feels awkward, and generally leads to experts talking to other experts like they are both in elementary school. In The Martain, there isn't a character for that really (maybe Teddy and Annie a bit?). The person that needs to stuff explained to them is the person viewing Watney's video logs. However, Watney knows that the person viewing the logs will probably be at least a little bit informed about the science of the things he's doing, so he doesn't explain every little thing.

Like they never say what MAV stands for, and we don't absolutely need to know that it's a **M**ars **A**scent **V**ehicle, but we understand that it's the rocket thing he uses to escape. They never actually say was a SOL is, but by the way it's used, a normal person would easily guess that it's essentially a ""space day"" and be happy. They use the term HAB plenty, but they don't explicitly say that it's short for Habitat, because they don't need to. There are tons of other things in the movie. Somehow they also keep it at a level where science-minded people will understand what they are talking about and know it's accurate, and less scientifically-minded people will still get the gist of what they are talking about enough to follow what they are planning. They balanced it really well."
476,cvmy6oc,"Good point. Probably more likely is an incorrect analysis by the tech that any use of an -ing makes it a gerund, which of course it does not.

Or maybe, ""Fucking you up is the first thing I'll do when I get back to earth I'm so mad!"" I don't know, that's pushing the grammar and scene a bit still ..."
477,cvmgy6n,That was an alternate ending. It wasn't actually in the book.
478,cvne6yv,"I just did some more searching and actually managed to find it this time, if anyone else is wondering there's a comment here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/2lc0v6/discussion_spoilers_the_martian_by_andy_weir/cmpmuqm

EDIT: and I can definitely see why he removed it, it really does stink."
479,cvmb6c0,that was plenty
480,cvmpsk2,Better love story than Twilight.
481,cvny5xo,This made the movie more accurate 
482,cvlna6c,"He actually was, in all three films. Merely in the background. He plunged a sword through an orc in the Last Alliance battle. He was in the scene where Arwen has a premonition and he was also there for the crowning of Aragorn."
483,cvnjthe,"that scene where he was trying to patch his helmet, and the tape started sticking to itself and his hand is one of those universal struggles whenever you're trying to work fast with duct tape. I know that frustration..."
484,cvndohy,I'm waiting for the Director's cut with the extra 3 hours to explain the history of space duct tape.
485,cvyoxvn,"One guy needed help opening an attachment on his computer.

She's clearly the programmer, but yeah she didn't exactly say anything a non-programmer astronaut shouldn't understand. If anything, on a mission like that, each astronaut should receive a certain level of cross training just in case shit happens to one of the others. Redundant redundancy."
486,cvmhkkn,"I was about to say...

And what is this alternate ending you speak of?"
487,cvt8mot,A street cat just had babies a couple weeks ago. The male cat is nowhere to be seen. Still a better love story than Twilight.
488,cvlxfkg,"But he was never truly identified to the audience is my point. Which is unfortunate, because like you, he is my favorite character from Tolkien's mythology. "
489,cw2uvfh,That scene was so well done. We've all struggled with the damn tape sticking to itself - imagine dealing with it when you're literally moments from death.
490,cvypk89,"Actually, he couldn't open it because the file was invalid as it was a text file encoded as a JPEG."
491,cvmrqlj,"It was pretty terrible. Watney on earth eating a slice of pizza, yelling at a kid. I saw it in /r/books somewhere. "
492,cvm6oop,"Please remind me what his role was, reading the Silmarillion is some time ago for me"
493,cwav9fh,It looked like he instinctively tried to use his mouth to help straighten out the tape and forgot about that whole helmet thing.
494,cvyppnr,"Right, point being he isn't as knowledgeable about it as she is so he went to the expert for help. Areas of expertise exist and so it makes sense for the pilot to not necessarily know everything a programmer talks about."
495,cvmrutu,"Wow, that does sound terrible. "
496,cvm9gzl,"Well, in the Fellowship of the Ring he is in fact the one who brings Frodo to Rivendell, not Arwen as it was in the film. His involvement in events mentioned in the Silmarillion were even more awesome though. He was an incredible warrior who took part in many important battles. He was killed by a Balrog though, but was resurrected and sent back to middle earth where he took part in the defeat of the Witch King at the battle of Fornost and later fought in the battles in the north during the war of the ring. Few characters in the Tolkien mythos have a rap sheet quite like Glorfindel. "

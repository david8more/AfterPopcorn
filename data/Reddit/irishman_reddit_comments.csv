0,f8vum2q,The last 30 minutes were so brutally depressing
1,f8wuhe9,Pesci sat at the airport for 3+ hours in the car just hanging out. Boss move.
2,f8vcmch,The whole “It is what it is” scene was fucking fantastic.
3,f8v6q24,We already knew that Joe Pesci was an incredible actor but to come out of a 20 year retirement and give that performance is some legendary shit.
4,f8vag93,"The restaurant scene with Hoffa and Pro has to be one of the greatest things I've seen all year. 

Absolutely wonderful film."
5,f8v0kmc,Harvey Keitel is a cool mofo.
6,f8vbzlh,"What stood out to me in the film is the way that Jimmy gets killed. We know it's coming, and we know that this will be Frank's most affecting and difficult murder. But based on just how their relationship is built and plays out through the film, I thought that it would culminate in Jimmy suddenly realizing that Frank will murder him and saying something like, ""Frank, how could you do this? I treated you like family. I loved you!"" - something that's drawn out and wrought with angst and tenderness before the act. But nope, as soon as he turns to the door, Frank just whips out his gun, fires twice in succession, and it's all over in a second. Frank murders Jimmy just like he did with the numerous other victims we saw - quick and emotionless, like it's all just part of the job (emphasizing the military parallel). It's disturbing because Jimmy truly loved and valued Frank, and Frank is agonizing over what he will have to do, and yet, the way he carries out the murder of his best friend, someone he said he will always back, is instinctive. It speaks volumes about Frank's lack of soul (or at least, it being so numb)."
7,f8yb7q3,"""Your lawyer's dead""

""Who did it?""

""Cancer"""
8,f8w4kij,"""What kind of a man makes a phone call like that...?"""
9,f8v1qa2,"People in my theatre in the UK were laughing in the strangest places

I heard people laughing when Pesci struggles to eat the bread in prison and his hands were shaking. 

Thought was rather heartbreaking tbh."
10,f8vigl1,"I loved how they introduced some of the characters with a text description, including their names and when and how they died/got killed. I think it's the essence of the movie, taking away instantly the ""coolness"" and ""glamour"" of being a gangster, seeing how almost always ends bad and how sad it is."
11,f918ann,One of the most affecting parts to me was at the end when De Niro was telling his nurse about how most people don’t even know who Jimmy Hoffa was anymore and it seems like he’s about to launch into some starry eyed story time and she politely but flippantly cuts him off to take his blood pressure and as soon as she’s done she walks off.
12,f90nmz2,"“You always charge a guy with a gun - with a knife, you run away. So you charge with a gun - with a knife, you run”

Pacino’s performance was incredible!"
13,f8v2zgj,Damn the whole part with Pesci in the prison was just heartbreaking.
14,f917xob,I can't believe I'm spending my thanksgiving depressed over jimmy hoffa
15,f8v0pw3,He really was asking too many questions about that fish
16,f8xoi3j,That scene when Jo is fired and she hesitates before starting her car is one of the most tense things I've seen on film in years.
17,f8vt7ye,The entire scene for the ceremony dinner at the casino banquet will be a thing of movie legend. Pacino eating his steak staring at them with menace. Deniro pleading with Pacino to wise up. Pacino and Pesci having a scene together for the first and only time in their careers (while a concerned Deniro looks on from a distance). Pesci awarding Deniro the ring. It’s so much and it’s so fucking amazingly done and acted.
18,f8v5a45,"It's a small scene but the one that really got to me was when they show how Hoffa's body was cremated in secret and then it cuts to Frank who says ""it was no more complicated than that.""

I love that so much. It's just so unglamorous. Of course the answer to one of those great 20th century mysteries would be so simple and so not extraordinary. And even if that's not what actually happened to Hoffa you know the real truth is probably just as sad and mundane. It plays so well with the dour final act."
19,f8wvbob,"When Frank was telling Russ that he told Jimmy he would meet him at 2, fuck man that scene gave me chills. I also liked how De Niro insisted on sitting on that backseat even though it was wet, goes to show how alert and aware he was on getting wacked."
20,f8v0ipj,"Probably my favorite line ever from Al Pacino:


“Sick? He had a fucking stroke! That's not sick, that's you're close to the grave. He’s turning into a fucking eggplant”"
21,f8v45kr,"The part where The Irishman is staring at the guys ears trying to figure out if he was supposed to be the inside man or not was hilarious.  
  
""I got surgery so people would stop staring at my ears."""
22,f8v0hwt,"The Irishman is Scorsese's mournful eulogy to the gangster genre. What a moving portrayal of guilt, loneliness, regret, mortality, and the consequences of a crime-filled life on everyone in its periphery. The last hour is one of his finest moments and that final shot will stay with me forever."
23,f8v6wub,So much fun watching Ray Romano and Al Pacino acting off one another.
24,f8vmrur,Does anyone want to talk about Pesci's performance? It's incredible how mellow he was. It almost felt like Pacino was playing the character that Pesci usually plays. And both of them knocked it out of the park!
25,f8wknfv,"Anthony ""Tony Jack"" Giacalone

Well-liked by all.

Died of natural causes. 

February 23, 2001."
26,f8v1rma,[deleted]
27,f8v8xsa,Saw this a couple of weeks ago and still can’t get that Pacino/Pesci scene out of my head. With those it’s such a surprisingly tender scene of Hoffa and Russell having a heart to heart.
28,f8v1dj7,Type in “The Irishman: In Conversation” on Netflix and there is a 23 minute sit down with the cast and Scorsese!
29,f8v0qwt,Shout out to Action Bronson making it into such a monumental movie!
30,f8vapbn,"There was a nice jolt of recognition when I realized that the actress playing Hoffa's wife was also Lois, the cranky babysitter from Goodfellas.

Its also fun going though The Irishman spotting familiar faces from The Sopranos and Boadwalk Empire in the massive cast."
31,f8xnelf,No film has frightened me of my own aging and mortality than this one.
32,f92xc1e,"I about cried when Jimmy Hoffa knew he was about to get whacked, but he still didn’t know it would be Frank. Just the simple utterance of:

###“Let’s get out of here, Frank.”

Broke my heart. Great movie."
33,f8wadmz,"Jeez that last half hour was depressing as fuck.  Seeing your daughter disappearing from your life, seeing all of your partners eventually dying, and your body becoming old and fickly, knowing that you’re next in line, and you just have to accept it as it is. Scorsese pulled no punches the end.

Great movie overall."
34,f93lh2x,"Small detail- Hoffa was furious after waiting 15 minutes for Tony, but he waited 40 minutes for Frank and wasn’t even that upset. He really loved and trusted him."
35,f8v7jdz,The look Peggy gives Russell when she pulls out the $100 bill is priceless
36,f8v0k25,It’s a shame this is probably the last great gangster movie form De Niro and Pesci but damn did they do well for there last one.
37,f8vq3m2,"Anna Paquin has one line and yet it’s one of the most impactful and important lines in the whole movie 

“Why?”"
38,f8w7wwx,"Hoffa was as much a gangster as them ....


when he tells tony pro hes below him ...I love Sheeran's and tony pros guys reaction 


Cmon Jimmy you cant say that

fkn Jimmy had balls of steel lol"
39,f8wv693,Elderly post stroke Pesci trying to eat bread with “the good grape juice” hit me so deep in my feels.
40,f8v0n3f,"Anyone else feel that Robert De Niro really shows his age while kicking the grocer that shoved his daughter?

That right arm had senior citizen written all over it. Stood out compared to how old the character was supposed to be."
41,f8v1in3,"Saw the movie a week ago at the cinema, will watch at home again at some stage but it was easily one of the best movies I’ve seen this year if not the best.

Perfectly paced, didn’t feel like a 3 and a half hour picture, acting was probably the best I’ve seen in a long while, everyone pulled their weight perfectly, was a lot funnier than I thought it’d be.

Besides the main 3 (everyone will be talking about how great they were and rightfully so) thought Stephen Graham was fantastic. 
Pesci even after all this time and not having done a live action role for 8 or 9 years gave an amazing performance.

Thought a great job was done to make all the characters feel like they were just regular guys that just had jobs to do and got on with it, not like typical mobster movies where they’re on a pedestal or larger than life.

Could go on and on but would be hard pushed to find a fault with it and if I did I’d be nitpicking."
42,f8xhj4n,Did anyone else notice the shot of Al Pacino getting killed in the beginning of the film? It was when Robert De Niro said he painted houses.
43,f8v2v89,Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino) calling Bobby Kennedy “Booby Kennedy” is by far one of the best jokes in the film.
44,f8v0xvh,That shot of Al’s POV of the empty room is parallel to Pesci’s POV when he gets whacked in Goodfellas. Both knew right away.
45,f9f9zee,"\>45-year-old looking De Niro is fixing truck  
\>50-year-old looking Joe Pesci walks up to him  
\>""hey kid"""
46,f8vvhu7,Got the sopranos final season vibes from this. Just a bleak movie
47,f8v0jmj,"*""Cocksucka""*"
48,f8v138e,"Al Pacino truly deserves an oscar nom at the very least for his role as Jimmy Hoffa, absolutely incredible performance."
49,f8vnp6m,"I think the blue contact lenses De Niro wears were a small mistake. Them combined with the deaging is what makes him look odd.

I also thought De Niro never looked younger than about fifty in the whole film other than the war scene"
50,f8w4y0b,Loved that prolonged stare scene between De Niro and Pesci conveying more than enough for that hit on Crazy Joe. This movie gave me goosebumps.
51,f8yt4mb,The only way I can describe the end is that I felt sad for Frank but not sorry for him.
52,f8wi037,De Niro was amazing but I loved anytime Pesci or Pacino was on the screen. So glad they got to share a scene together and as this is probably Pesci's last movie ever he couldn't have gone out on a higher note.
53,f8v0had,"What an amazing movie, definitely didn’t expect myself to tear up during the ending."
54,f8wmmk1,"Something that stuck out was just how much use they got out of the de-aging. It wasn't just to make a few of them look younger, it was to show the progression of time, gradually aging them more and more, even beyond their current age. I think they did it to Ray Romano, too."
55,f8vgwmc,"I saw it in the theatre a few weeks ago. 

Robert De Niro's character is such a self indulgent sociopathic prick with zero self awareness.  

It's so strange to have less sympathy for a character as they get older.  When he's old and frail and so scared of the finality of death while also being so falsely repentant for his crimes.  Unwilling to truly confess them.

I loved the movie.  I kept waiting to feel for Frank, but he's an incredibly empty man portrayed so well by De Niro."
56,f8v44dl,"As great as The Irishman and everybody in it is, I really believe Thelma Schoonmaker is the real hero of this project.

To keep a 3 hour 30 film feeling well-paced and to be constantly jumping the audience around to different time periods while keeping it coherent and not jarring is one hell of a difficult thing to do. Not to mention Scorsese shot something like 300 scenes compared to the average film’s 40-60, so she had a LOT of footage to work with."
57,f8wxga9,Who else now desperately wants a beer-steamed hot dog from Lum's?
58,f8vffvr,"Why is it saying that there's no post-credit scene? What about the CGI revived Marlon Brando saying to De Niro he has an initiative?

&#x200B;

EDIT: spelling"
59,f8wi6e7,"A lot has been said about Scorsese’s movies glorifying gangsters, and rightfully so-this is the antithesis of that. Seeing such a powerful boss like Pesci getting excited about “the good grape juice” and struggling to eat the bread, then seeing De Niro alone on Christmas, abandoned and rejected by his family is powerfully vindictive. No matter the power and glamor they had or have, they’re human like the rest of us, and in the end, everyone goes alone."
60,f8v2hhx,DeNiro absolutely killed it over the last hour or so. The scene where where he makes *that* phone call is some of the best acting I've ever seen.
61,f8vednc,"I felt so happy when the movie started. 
There’s the Scorsese long shot, there’s De Niro and there’s the narration he does which takes us on the journey.
 Felt awesome to get another De Niro/Scorsese/Pesci gangster movie in 2019."
62,f8vj274,"the young faces look great BUT you can tell they are still old man bodies. deniro especially, his shoulders are just hunched in such and old way that dossnt match his face at all, but everybody moves like an old man. rewatch any time someone rises from a chair and you can see the old man within, so it kind of has a creepy effect."
63,f8xk9em,"What a remarkable piece of work this movie is. Absolutely remarkable. Sure, De Niro clipped about like a man with a compressed spine, but other than that the de-aging stuff never really occurred to me.

Pesci’s performance though... Christ...

Russell said no more than he needed to, and did no more than was absolutely necessary, but he absolutely exuded malevolence from every pore. With barely a change in his expression, he was able to communicate whole paragraphs on how much he was going to fuck up the lives of those who displeased him. Just incredible."
64,f8v0hx9,"> “The unexamined life is not worth living”

This cliched Socrates translation (the motto of my high school) helped frame how I see the character of Frank Sheeran. Personally, I found THE IRISHMAN to be profoundly moving. Any epic this broad will speak differently to each viewer, so I’ll just articulate my own narrow reading–the film as an exploration of how those who do not interrogate their own actions will live a meaningless life. 

Frank Sheeran is incapable of meaningful introspection.

He attempts self *reflection* (indeed, that structures the movie), but he struggles to interrogate his own narrative. Frank is a shockingly passive participant (both as an aged storyteller, and as a mob foot soldier), and his thoughtless life becomes a tragic embodiment of the Socrates quote.

Frank represents the *banality* of evil, a consistently undermotivated and passive foot soldier. In the moment, Frank can tell himself comfortable justifications–he’s working to better his family, his friends, the union, and himself. Yet, as these motivations are exposed as hollow, we’re confronted with a sobering alternative. What if Frank’s central failure was not greed or cruelty, but rather, an inability to interrogate his own choices? What if Frank was a passenger in his own narrative, unable to question whether there was another way?

This idea is at its most poignant and literal in Frank's flashback to war. He stands guard with his gun as the prisoners dig their own graves, musing “I always wondered why they kept digging”. He is painfully unaware of the irony, and we will watch Frank dig his *own* grave for the next three hours. As a hitman, Frank holds the gun, so he blithely assumes that he must be the soldier, but we see him as the prisoner with a shovel (the loss of individual agency in the mob collective is a Scorsese staple). The final act provides us with a biting callback to this scene when Frank goes to the morgue to purchase his own coffin (the expression “digging your own grave” made literal).

The reasons for Frank’s lack of introspection are both personal and societal. Toxic masculinity is a pervasive theme in Scorsese’s filmography, and Frank takes that emotional repression to the extreme. Hoffa grumbles that Frank never shares how he feels, but the problem lies not in his refusal to share, but in his refusal to allow himself to feel in the first place. Even the impoverished language of the mobsters is crafted to inhibit meaningful dialogue, with each new order provided as a euphemism. The most devastating of these is when Russell seals Hoffa’s fate (and with it, Frank’s), with the chilling line *“It's what it is”*. Could the euphemism be any more apt? Frank’s life “is what it is” *because* Frank never questions whether it could be anything different.

Frank’s refusal to confront his own self cannot save him from judgment. Peggy’s eyes provide a chilling visual motif, operating as Frank’s conscience, and those maturing eyes eventually pierce to the heart of who her father truly is. I’ve seen some argue that Anna Paquin’s role is undermined by her limited line count, but her silence is more powerfully damning than words could ever be. When she does speak, it is the signature line of the climax, a charged and desperate **“Why?”**. De Niro’s silent response is agonizing, and “Why?” is the enduring question that Frank has avoided confronting his entire life. Peggy’s follow-up statement (clarifying “Why… didn’t you call Jo?”) allows the plot to progress, but it’s that first question which we hear most clearly, and it will haunt Frank for the rest of his life. In his old age, Frank’s legacy is defined by the absence of these women who should have been his pride and joy.

In the heartbreaking final act, Frank attempts to atone for his “unexamined life” with a furious flurry of self reflection, yet it’s as inadequate as a study session the day after an exam. Introspection matters because it lets us make better decisions in the future, and with Frank’s fate sealed, these attempts are hollow. When Frank begs Delores to tell Peggy that he’s sorry, Delores angrily demands that he explain “For what?”. Once again, Frank has no good answer (although Delores is happy to fill in a few of the blanks, preemptively rebutting the claim that he did it to protect his family). In his final confession, Frank admits that he has no “remorse”, and I’m inclined to believe him. Of course he has regret (it consumes him), but true remorse requires substantive *reckoning* with your actions, which Frank still cannot do. How can you atone when you don’t understand your own agency? 

THE IRISHMAN is a somber, joyless epic, exploring the tragedy of a man’s wasted life. And yet, I don’t find it wholly bleak, because ultimately, *we are not Frank Sheeran*. The ambiguous final shot of the movie (Frank’s door left half open, a callback to his time with Hoffa), leaves us with a kernel of hope. I see this not as a statement about Frank (the camera draws away, leaving behind the man on his deathbed, his fate sealed); rather, it leaves the *audience* with the half open door, because our future remains yet unwritten.

Obviously, I was captivated by this movie, and this (far too long) post only scratches the surface. There is so much more to say about the work of Pesci and Pacino, the themes of death, legacy, & salvation, and the film’s technical achievements. Now that it is finally streaming, I'm just glad that everyone can share and enjoy this treasure of a movie."
65,f8xvki5,"""Keep the money, he's not gonna need it."""
66,f8y6ei6,I've not seen it mentioned yet but my favourite scene was Frank and the other guy secretly getting drunk on the watermelon during his first meeting with Hoffa. Funnier scene than any comedy has delivered this year.
67,f99mlcy,"Al Pacino saying ""They wouldn't dare"" is my favorite part of any movie this year.

He really rocks the fuck out of this movie."
68,f8virmx,The last thirty minutes of this is the scariest horror movie of 2019.
69,f8vo642,Is there any way Thelma doesn't win the Best Editing Oscar for this? I've never seen a 3.5 hour movie feel so short. Will be lovely to see her on the stage again :)
70,f8v0n47,I like how there wasn’t really a happy part of Frank’s story. Any other Scorsese mob movie has some montage or something of them living it up. Frank doesn’t get that; he’s a working stiff and then he’s the lone survivor after all houses are painted.
71,f8yq66b,I think the last shot of the movie takes place in the night Frank Sheeran actually died. According to Wikipedia he died on December 14th and in the scene they say it's almost christmas. It's really a great closing shot with the open door.
72,f923cvg,"Just realized on second watch, when Frank is accepting his award. “I’m behind you, Jimmy.” 

Fuck."
73,f8w90n7,What a film but jeez the ending was depressing. The bank scene where Frank is struggling to walk but still wishes to reconcile with his daughter made me tear up
74,f8xaj32,I never would have thought an extended conversation about fish could be so filled with dread and Unbearable tension. Masterful.
75,f8v824a,Scorsese remains one of the best directors of all time. How is he still pumping out amazing movies after 50+ years in the industry
76,f91cinp,I thought the deaging worked best on Pacino. Guys nearly 80 but the CGI worked so well on him that he looked in his fifties in this
77,f92042a,They did Robert wrong with the grocery clerk scene. Should have tried to shoot a better take. That stomp out was laughable.
78,f8vdhex,"So the movie is called ""The Irishman"" but the title cards say ""I Heard You Paint Houses"". If you'd go to the cinema same title would show up at the ending instead of ""The Irishman"" (on Netflix they changed it to ""The Irishman""). 

So i assume that Scorsese wanted to use different title, but the Netflix made him work with ""The Irishman"".

Edit: I like ""I heard you paint houses"" much better to be honets."
79,f8v3eho,"Everything from Sheeran’s celebratory dinner where they discuss finally putting the hit on Hoffa to that final shot of Sheeran alone in the dark of his room waiting to die is some of the most haunting and harrowing filmmaking I’ve ever seen. 

I was worried when this project was announced that Scorsese was just gonna revisit the substantive and stylistic well that he had already mined plenty in Goodfellas, Casino, and even The Wolf of Wall Street. But I’m so glad to be proven wrong in that this has way more to do with something like Mean Streets, or even Raging Bull. It’s a film about the deep moral guilt that comes with living your life unexamined until it’s too late and you have to live with the consequences, and in that sense, while this film does play with the associations to Goodfellas and Casino, it has way more to do with Scorsese’s more personal and religious films."
80,f8vn7k9,"SPOILERS AHEAD:
For me, the last 50 minutes made the film. Up until then it felt like a by-the-numbers mafia film but when the last 50 min focuses on him in the nursing home, allowing that reflection to be had...that gave it the emotional payoff. 
Seeing Frank isolated to the point of having to choose his own casket because all his mob friends are dead and his family have, understandably, cut ties to him. I felt sorry for Frank, for how foolish he was.
Also I love how it tied back to earlier, seemingly random events, like Frank beating up the shopkeeper and stomping the hand off him in front of the daughter. Frank's realisation of the dysfunction he exhibited to his kids. His regret for how he behaved and a clear wish to do things differently.
This hit me personally too because it reminded me of my grandfather, who I loved, but my mother found a difficult man and he did say to her and the rest before passing he was sorry he wasnt there for them and thought wealth, going off working, putting food on the table was priority. Frank had a similar issue, the realisation that providing for your family is the minimum standard and not the be all and end all. Just being there for your kids, sitting with them, spending time with them and actually watching them grow up is so much more important. That struck a cord with me and gave the movie some emotional depth."
81,f8vyr1x,I watched it again and on second watch i realised that the shot taken in the first scene as a flashback after Frank said he started painting houses is Hoffa getting killed
82,f91q4jc,"There's been a lot of discussion of different scenes, especially in the third act--but the one that cemented things for me was this line of questioning:

""Why?""

""Why?""

""Why didn't you call Jo?""

You just know in his daughter's voice, her face, her posture--the question for the first two ""Why""s are not ""why didn't you call Jo?,"" they're more a ""why did you do this?"""
83,f92eq44,"When Hoffa was released from prison and the reporter asks him ""How were your 4 years in there?""

""Oh, I loved it! Had a great time!""

Haha Pacino's delivery was perfect!"
84,f8widcx,Pacino’s bravado was something to marvel.
85,f8xtpe0,"jesus, the last act of this movie is grim"
86,f8yaeyp,"I just have to comment again. That sequence from Pacino approaching the car to Pacino attempting to leave the house was amazing. I don't even know how to explain it since I'm only a casual movie watcher, but I think I had to hold my breath during that sequence. Pacino should be nominated for Best Supporting Actor just for that sequence alone IMO.

Shout out to whoever played Sally Bugs because he was the most terrifying person in that entire sequence."
87,f9ijl3u,"There's a very short scene near the beginning which shows how good Joe Pesci is in this movie. It's when they're on the road trip and his wife's family name is introduced. It flashes back to a night when Pesci comes home with blood on his clothes, and his wife says she'll clean everything up.

Watch his eyes and body language in that scene. He looks like he's ashamed of the violence he's committed, but also highly alert, like he's still in survival mode. When she reminds him to take off his shoes, he's almost startled.

Pacino had more to work with and will probably get the nominations, but I think Pesci is equally deserving of best supporting actor."
88,f9127lv,Was not expecting Action Bronson to be in this lol
89,f921w9r,"The part at the end really hit me. “Your attorney is dead, Russ is dead, Angelo is dead, Fat toney is dead, Tony Pro is dead. It made me feel so old, like just 10 minutes ago all these guys were so young."
90,f93rn1e,Am I right in thinking that Frank asks the priest to leave the door open in the last scene because Jimmy used to do that?
91,f8v31hn,"That scene where Pesci and De Niro converse in Italian made my heart skip a beat. With the de aging technology, it really looked like De Niro in Godfather 2."
92,f94c2lh,"For the life of me, I'll never understand how people who binge-watch 9 episodes of a television show in a day can complain about a 3-4 hour movie."
93,f8vc0d6,One of my favourite scenes that had me laughing out loud was the conversation about the fish on the back seat of the car. Then they pick Hoffa up and he starts laying into his son about it as well haha.
94,f8z00a0,"It's a good movie, one that I'm definitely going to watch again and again at some point because it was impeccably edited and really just felt like a ton of content to deliver rather than a slog. Even Once Upon A Time In America, which this is almost similar to, never flowed this well. I could have honestly watched another hour if it was edited well.

But I got to say, watching Joe Pesci was MESMERIZING. Maybe it was partly the hiatus - I remember loving him in the 30 seconds cameo he was in The Good Sheppard too, so there definitely is some novelty to him just being here. But my God, he was incredible. The nuance, subtlety, and just carefulness of his performance was pure joy honestly. The character is thoughtful, deliberate, warm at times to people he cared for, but at the end of day, cold as ice. But I can't recall him being overly menacing one time, which for him is impressive, but you just knew he was extremely dangerous. Frighteningly good and probably my favorite performance of the year."
95,f90ur2o,"I absolutely love how they didn’t over dramatize Hoffa’s execution scene. This isn’t to say there wasn’t tension or drama, but they filmed it in a fast paced and similar manner to all the other executions in the movie. It kinda made it feel more real, like despite all that Frank and Hoffa had been through together, he ended his life quick and abruptly"
96,f91koyd,"I have to say that was one of the best movies I’ve ever seen. 

I spent the first act amazed by De Niro’s storytelling and scene setting. What a perfect intro for Pesci’s character. From the first line you can immediately see that this guy holds the strings. Honestly this was probably the most intimidating out of the three Pesci crime characters (DeVito, Santoro, and Buffalino).  The scene where Frank is casually talking about murdering POW’s and you can immediately see that Frank is the perfect soldier: strong, smart, careful, determined, loyal, and most of all didn’t question orders. 

Then Pacino steps in and the story takes off. Man did Pacino steal every scene he was in. Probably a top 3 Pacino performance in my books. They show the sub story with the Kennedy assassination to add depth to the characters and it was beautifully weaves into the second act. The scenes with Tony Pro and Pacino were legendary. Who wears shorts to a meeting? You’re more than ten minutes late you’re saying something. Just the way Pacino commanded the room as Jimmy Hoffa would have was legendary. And then there’s the end of the second act where what we all know happens happens and it’s perfect. It’s not a slowed down shot of Pacino falling to the floor with a violin playing in the background, it was a hit just like any of the other hits. I could really write more about how impressed I was with the second act of this film. It was probably 2.25 hours long and it felt like 30 minutes. 

And then it gets better and the themes of the movie begin to hit. Begins with a gutsy decision to give Peggy one line in the movie and it pays off beautifully. She truly saw through Frank, I believe even more so than the other daughters all the way to the very end. De Niro calling Jo incredible acting. I could feel the guilt and remorse in De Niro for the first time in this movie and it really adds to the theme of how ugly the gangster world gets. And then scene by scene it gets darker and darker and darker and we see how truly alone every single one of the gangsters ended up. Pesci in the prison playing that bowling type game and then being wheeled off to his deathbed. It then finishes with the conclusion to De Niro’s character and man is that shit sad. You can see it so clearly that De Niro is feeling some sort of guilt and remorse at that point. The leaving scene of the priest absolving Frank of his sins and then telling him he’s leaving and Frank asks him to leave the door open in hopes that someone will show that they care about him. 

Truly a sad film to its core. I felt very similarly to how I did at the end of raging bull. Scorsese really knows how to hit your soul with his movies. Also obligatory typical camerawork Scorsese compliment but as always Scorsese’s camera work is best in the business by far. Nobody does the slow moving camera mimicking a person walking through a scene at the same pace as the music in the background. Legendary. And yes the editing too, to make 3.5 hours feel like 1.5 hours takes an extreme amount of hard work and skill in your craft.

I’m going to have to watch it 2 more times b4 I can put it in my rankings but after my first watch probably going to find itself in my top 3 (yes I know basic r/movies movies but hey I like what I like)
1. Inglorious Bastards, Tarantino
2. Return of the King, Jackson
3.  The Irishman, Scorsese"
97,fasr9b2,"Clever how he didn't want to sit behind the car strangler.

At first I was overthinking it. I thought he doesn't want to sit next to Hoffa's son as he's about to off Hoffa due to his guilt. But then I thought ""oh yeah! Car strangler! Duh."""
98,fexo5fq,"Are people enjoying this film for what it is, or are they enjoying it more because it has many big names involved and their already earned career is just boosting its perception?

I saw it last night and honestly thought the same story could have been told with the film at a 2 hour length rather than 3.5."
99,f8vv34j,That parting shot... Imagine living the rest of your days alone racked with guilt.
100,f8xh08k,"Loved that little freeze frame of the mobster who lived to old age and was well liked by everyone (as opposed to getting the usual bullets to the face)

*it was in the scene where Tony Pro was getting arrested during the card game in Florida"
101,f91nslt,"The acting is masterpiece. So natural it doesn't feel like acting. I'm particularly impressed with Joe Pesci's Russ. So low-key, yet have powerful influence to drive people did things at his request.

I might have missed it out, but what is Peggy's relationship with Hoffa? When did it start?"
102,f92egsy,"My favorite shot of the movie was the front of the car coming out of the car wash, like a moving painting. 

Soundtrack was extremely well done. 

I think the contact lenses were a mistake though. More distracting than the de-aging."
103,f94p6go,"When Jimmy and Frank went into the house, Jimmy said ""Let's get out of here, Frank"".... showing his care for Frank, only to be betrayed by the same person in the next moment...."
104,f950wbu,"Man I kinda liked this movie. Watched it in 3 installments, because couldn't find 3 and a half hours to sit down at once, but if you can it's worth it. 

The last 30 odd minutes of this movie are what sets it apart from say, Goodfellas, casino or the departed. I think that ending is what Scorcese really wanted to show us. The life of Frank Sheeran, or any other mobster, Henry Hill or anyone. You are gonna end up worse than a schnook. Nothing you did mattered, and you'll die either a violent death or live miserably waiting for death."
105,ffgjz18,When Jimmy realized he was gonna get whacked he didn't even consider that it'd be Frank doing it. That was fucking sad as hell.
106,f8v0h8k,I just want to point out that this is a $150M+ epic that ends with a shot of an old man alone on Christmas. Let's see the next Avengers movie do that!
107,f8vy3rh,[deleted]
108,f8v17io,"Just finished it. All i can say is that its a masterpiece. Goodfellas was good but this is a totally different animal. Not better or worse, its just so much more layered. Im kind of still processing the film so can't think of much to say really lol. Im stunned by the performances of Pesci, Deniro and Pacino. Truly 3 masters at their best. Seeing Pesci as a really really old man in prison was a heartbreaking. Not for the character, but for the realisation that its gonna happen to us all. Be as big and strong and tough as you want, but no one escapes father time. I know that sounds obvious but this film conveys it in a way i've never seen before. Im honestly stunned at the moment. What a film."
109,f8vzlj3,"There's a character with a small part towards the beginning of the movie, the ""Ferrie that's a fairy,"" who helps DeNiro smuggle arms down to Cuba.  I think he's based on the same guy as the [David Ferrie character](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ema7lfEAMk) played by Joe Pesci in JFK."
110,f8wu0sv,"Can anyone explain why Hoffa's threat that he 'knows things' did nothing to protect him?  

They all did wind up convicted, wasn't that because of the dirt Hoffa had as life insurance?"
111,f93phu4,"It makes me incredibly sad that Hoffa just couldn’t get the hint. They really liked him and would have taken care of him. Russell suggests at Franks honorary party that if it’s money no problem. If it’s “power” he could still run the union without being the actual leader and current face. But no, Hoffa was so fucking stubborn. I find that incredibly tragic. 

And after a rewatch, when Frank and Jimmy walk into the house and Frank has the gun out, you can visibly see his arm shaking a bit, and his face just reeked of sadness. 

Pride is a mofo."
112,f94yrfw,"It’s funny if you watch the extra with them discussing the film, Pacino is the oldest (79) but he looks the youngest, I thought that in the movie as well - no matter the de-ageing tech I thought Pacino looked the youngest and most believable but he’s a few years older. Good genes maybe :)"
113,f99qe98,Frank going to visit Peggy at the bank was just heart breaking. This was truly a wonderful movie.
114,fbusc97,"Just saw the whole thing, and the last 30 minutes was by far one of the most poignant and depressing things I've seen on film. It's not ugly-cry sad or something that tugs at my heartstrings, but it's just sad as it just makes you feel empty inside. Seeing all of these people who I've spent nearly three hours with go away one by one and seeing Frank all alone in his room is just sad to see, and seeing him plan out his death and Peggy cutting off all contact with him was heartbreaking. It's definitely a showcase on the genius of Scorcese and the beauty of this film.

Also, am I the only one who was surprised by seeing Action Bronson?"
115,f8wdvon,"What a fucking great movie. Scorcese is a genius. Al Pacino stole every scene he was in for me. His greatest performance for decades. I was completely captivated by him every single time he appeared on screen. His stubborn, no bullshit style was hilarious as it was tragic towards the movie's conclusion. He deserves every award for this movie. 

 Joe Pesci too, knocked it out of the fucking park. We're all used to seeing him as the deranged violent criminal but in this he's subdued, friendly even, a gentle presence.

Robert De Niro was obviously great too. Very understated. We all know someone like him in this film. Old-school. No nonsense. Quiet. Doesn't like to make a big deal out of anything. Sad in a way that they're unable to properly express their emotions. He was great too.

This felt like a successor to movies like Goodfellas, which is one of my favourites. But I liked this movie for how different it felt at times. It was a more realistic, less glamourising look at this lifestyle. Usually the mobsters die in a blaze of glory but here, we watched the slow, sad decline of the movie's characters as they come to terms with the awful things they did. I really wish Scorcese could be around for another forty fucking years and could continue making movies like this. We really need them."
116,f8vswd0,"What a fucking fantastic film. De Niro was great but to me, the best actors in this movie were Al Pacino and Joe Pesci. What a fantastic examination of guilt and regret this was. 

Also, the real MVP of this movie is Thelma Schoonmaker. This did not feel like 209 minutes long at all and to keep a movie with so many different time periods flowing so effortlessly that even my mom who watched the first part of it understood what was happening. Just insane."
117,f92ldv5,"Young De Niro looked 50 when he should have been 30. It's almost funny when you have ancient fucking Joe Pesci calling ancient De Niro ""a kid"""
118,f8waz10,They weren't kidding when they said 'slow burn' and I think that was a great choice.
119,f91x6o7,"Great movie. 9/10. 

The meeting with the little guy in Florida after he and Jimmy got out of prison was laugh out loud hilarious."
120,f933l1b,"This movie makes me want to start a union.

SOLIDARITY SOLIDARITY SOLIDARITY"
121,f93thy3,"I think some people will be disappointed because when they think Scorsese they think Goodfellas which is a fast paced and upbeat film.

The Irishman meanders. It's slower paced and that's what I love it for. It reminded me a lot of No Country for Old Men by the Coen brothers. The films have a lot of similar themes.

I think the overall point of the film, and I hate to narrow it down to just a few things because it certainly is more than just this.. but if I had to bring it to a couple of three things it'd be about the following:

The mob and criminal life is never worth it. It's glamorized but the truth is that it more often than not just ends in death or loneliness. Look at the highest highs of criminal life. You'd probably think Escobar with his Billions in the 80's. His own private Zoo and mansion and girls and the most extravagant life you can conjure. I don't think you could reach a higher peak than Escobar at his prime. Top 3 richest man in the world, partied all the time, was treated almost as a deity by the locals where he operated. Even he ended up shot dead on a roof top with his ass hanging out.

Time is a big theme here too. How it just marches on and on with no resolution. This is a big theme in No Country for Old Men and I got the same feeling when both films come to a conclusion, the inevitability of it all. All these proud, notorious men but they all succumb to the slow crushing weight of death and old age. It just churns and churns and makes all their fights and killings and beefs and arguments for naught. Death takes them all the same, so was it really worth it getting into all those fights and not just enjoying life? Goes back to the theme of crime isn't really worth it.

Off the topic of themes, I enjoyed how raw the film was. The killings were quick and not glamorous. It felt authentic.

Finally, I like how Scorsese put those death notations around for all these characters who are shown as wild and entertaining in what they do just for a still shot that says ""Hey, you see this guy? How interesting and lively he is? Well, doesn't amount to shit because he gets killed in a few years. So you might think hey that'd be fun to be that guy but, not really."" Loved that. Anyways, great film, will watch many more times."
122,f94q61h,"Al Pacino substantially elevated this movie. A lot of that is because Hoffa was just inherently the most interesting person of the people involved, but I thought the acting performance itself was one of Pacino's career bests. Obviously he invoked a lot of the usual Pacinoisms we've become accustomed to, but hey, that's what he's great at, you love to see it. Pacino's Hoffa is a wildly entertaining character, and he sort of turns the movie into a Greek tragedy where pride comes before the fall."
123,f8vzne1,"Scorsese literally deconstructed the goodfellas image with that. We see the killings, the wining and dining, the meetups and deal breaking. But we forget that ultimately, one day, you get old as fuck and everyone around you dies and you’re left sitting there waiting.

These people live fast and the worst thing is that if they do survive into old age, they have be prepared to die slow and live with the memories of what they did."
124,f90j31t,Movie made me think way too much about my own mortality. I try to quell that as much as possible.
125,f8xi1yd,Why do you think he kept the sunglasses?
126,f8xd4v2,No book. No newspaper. Appeared to be just sitting in silence contemplating the things one must contemplate.
127,f97sxc5,This scene confused me. Why did Di Niro fly out? I thought they were close enough to drive there?!
128,f8w142d,"Every time I've watched it, the ""They wouldn't dare"" speech really gets me especially the build up after."
129,f8xlslt,De niro was in a jam. He knew his family was on the line as revealed later. He just picked his family over his friend. Traitor. Yet traitor for understandable reasons.
130,f8xceei,This is only made better when you learn that Pesci ***nearly*** came out of retirement for Gotti. He was set to play Angelo Ruggiero alongside Travolta's Gotti but was abruptly dropped from the project after gaining nearly 30 pounds for the role. Pesci sued and reached an [undisclosed settlement out of court.](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/joe-pesci-settles-dispute-over-gotti-film-payday/)

132,f8w5wcv,Legendary how? Like I'm a legend? Like I'm here to amuse you?
133,f8wn01e,He played the exact opposite of the character he usually plays in Scorsese films. Him and Robert were really great in this
134,f8wm7y7,We did all we could for the man.
135,f90tp28,Best part of the movie and the more laid back character suited him well
136,f8vb4kt,"Be prepared to see ""who wears shorts to a meeting"" on every thread for the next few months."
137,f93mjep,"All I could think was how amazing it must have been for ""younger"" actors like Plemmons and Stephen Graham who are both amazing actor to actually share scenes with absolute legends like De Niro and Pacino.  
  
Plemmons's career really took off so quickly after Breaking Bad."
138,f8v9a62,"I’m kinda sad that he has been kind of forgotten in the film’s promotion. Yeah his role is a lot smaller than De Niro, Pacino and Pesci’s but he’s still one of the Scorsese OG’s. Loved the little we had of him."
139,f8vbr9e,"He was so great, even though he was only in the movie for such small amounts of time."
140,f9456ey,"I ended up getting the opportunity of going to the premiere.

When Keitel walked out on the red carpet, I had to call out to him. He came over and talked with us and just shook all of our hands.

Harvey Keitel is a cool mofo."
141,f8yy7p0,I loved that line when he’s telling Frank how good of a friend Russell is and Franks like “I know” and Angelo cuts him off and says “you don’t know”.
142,f8ve9un,[deleted]
143,f8x050x,"On second viewing, pretty sure we see the killing in the first 2 minutes of the film, when old DeNiro in the home talks about painting houses. We just see a gun shoot at the back of a head. Pretty sure it’s Frank shooting Jimmy."
144,f8xul8i,"To show just how well Scorsese crafted this film, when I saw it in theaters a week ago when Frank shot there were maybe a half a dozen people who audibly gasped.

I reflected on that, Scorsese did nothing to hide it was coming, he all but spelled it out with a few scenes at the house before. Also the carried knowledge of the audience that Hoffa disappeared and was likely killed. But Scorsese also crafted such an amazing relationship between the two that there were a handful of people in that theater who were surprised/shocked when the gun fired."
145,f8wma5f,It’s a brutal scene and shift for the film.
146,f8zd3d5,"> Frank murders Jimmy just like he did with the numerous other victims we saw - quick and emotionless, like it's all just part of the job (emphasizing the military parallel). 

His internal conflict about killing Jimmy happened with Russell. When he stutters and can't utter the words to try to convince Russell not to do this.

But once the decision is made. It's made. *It's what it is.*"
147,f8wrwvw,I was wondering why that carpet was being installed so poorly...
148,f91hcod,"Man. Brilliant. The one word that comes to mind with this movie is: subdued. No long drawn out emotional scene, Jimmy doesn’t have a moment where the audience can tell that he knows his friend will take him out, it just happens. I loved the subtle, gripping, very brief moment of fear Jimmy has ‘Frank let’s get out of here’ morning then boom its over. 

Which is why deniro was so good in this bc we see and feel all that they his eyes only. Like when Jimmy says ‘you may need some bodies bc they might come after you bc you’re with me’. Deniro’s face"
149,f8yeohd,Age was the real mob kingpin all along.

152,f8wv2xm,Was he referring to the one to Hoffa's wife?

167,f8wohzu,"I read it as a parallel to being a hitman, and doing a job.

Chucky was just sent to pick up a fish, he doesn’t pay attention to where it is or what it is, he is just asked/paid to do something and he does it.

The same way Frank and Sally carry out their hits. It exemplifies exactly how Frank feels having just being sent without real notice to an unknown place to do a job."
168,f8xrlh3,They fucked up a lot of cars in this movie

You can see his eyes glimmer with tears but he doesn’t let one fall. Fuck, Deniro really made me feel something only he can. Reminded me of Raging Bull and how he played Lamotta once he’d realised how much he’d messed up. 

That last monologue from him was so well done."

192,f98hwkx,"Honestly, when I used to see him in Everybody Loves Raymond doing his italian thing, I always thought he kinda looks like a friendly Pacino and that he’d be great in a gangster movie. Amazing that he was cast in one now, but only if he’d gotten a mobster part or brother of Pacino something like that"
193,f8xegti,"When Pesci was making the salad, and he simply looks up and says ""Don't call"" was unreal."
194,f8wi128,"Very true.
Pesci apparently doesn’t have to kick somebody’s face in to be intimidating.

Also loved the non-verbal moment Frank and Russ had, when it was clear they are going to kill ”Crazy Joe”."
195,f8xue4x,"I think he stole the entire show, and I do not say that lightly. I'm an unabashed Pacino fan and this is some of his greatest work in 25 years. But Pesci fucking blew me away with this role. I feel like Pesci was often type cast into similar types of roles, very loud, brash, and vulgar and violent people. This movie, in likely his final performance shows us what that unfortunate choice by filmmakers has robbed us of, a very nuanced, soft, and caring performance.

I would say, for me, this is Pesci's finest role."
196,f8vpmny,Could not agree more with this.
197,f91iff9,"I felt that’s what all 3 of them did best was to NOT fall into their past characters.

Pesci was subdued and didn’t fall into Nicki Santoro from Casino

Deniro as Sheeran was just a guy. Yea a killer and hit man but not a made man. He did well to not go full ‘boss’

And Pacino did well to capture Hoffa who, while he was a firecracker and powerful guy, also was not a made man. They did a brilliant job of never falling into the trap of making any of those 3 too ‘big’ for their respective roles (or sounding too Italian as jimmy and frank were not). 

Small example was when Frank tells Jimmy that Fat Tony  (the family boss) is involved. Pacino’s shoulders slumped and he had a lil realization."
198,f8xjttf,"That was hilarious after all the other bios, great comedic timing."
199,f8xogtr,He was a true fucking gangster though real boss of Detroit
200,f942k03,He didn't even have to experience 9/11
201,f8v4a1l,"> There is almost zero glamour in this movie. 

I think my favorite scene is the long celebratory banquet, and it captures this perfectly. Superficially, it is a coronation for Frank's life work, with important people attending to cheer and congratulate him on his life's work. And behind the scenes, you have Russell personally crowning him with the special ring. It's beautifully shot, luscious period scene, with great outfits, dancing, and music. All the ingredients are there for it to be the moment of genuine joy in the movie. 

And yet, it's completely hollow. In terms of plot, it's the staging ground for the turning point in Frank's life, when Hoffa's fate is sealed (""It is what it is, Frank""). All of the trappings of what should have been Frank's joy slide to the background, as Frank's undoing takes center stage. And De Niro's acting is excellent, he has this warm, almost naive smile he puts on as he's being congratulated, and it just starts to falter as Russell begins to hint at what is to come. He's trying so hard not to think about the truth of what's happening underneath that scene. 

The movie strikes such an incredible balance of being watchable and brisk, while being almost completely joyous. I'm sure some will reasonably be turned off by such a dark and long film, but the editing work is remarkable. The Wolf of Wall Street flew by, and was similarly well crafted, but having long cocaine fueled party scenes *really* helps. They had to keep up a similarly brisk pace, despite the actual subject matter being one man's tragic, failed, wasted, joyless life. Amazing work."
202,f8v9ubr,"That’s the scene that has stuck with me after seeing it a few weeks ago. When Pesci says “I’m trying to help you,” it’s so honest and Pacino understands what he’s saying, kind of, but won’t budge."
203,f8vem7i,"It autoplayed right after the movie for me, following the credits."

207,f8wkm74,Sebastian Maniscalco out of fuckin nowhere too.  Then I saw Jimmy Norton doing his best Rickles impersonation.  Did not expect any of these fools to pop up in this film.  Not to mention all the Sopranos actors that showed up.  Silvio's got some pipes on him!

216,f8wol1x,"That final stretch is what elevated the movie into something great, for me, and is what reinforces the idea that this is **not** just another dip in the GoodFellas well. The whole movie is a meditation on a wasted life, on betrayal, on duty, on neglecting family. That last 30 or 40 minutes casts everything that came before in a new light. Fantastic stuff."
217,f8z4u6c,"The FBI telling him that everyone is gone, including his attorney, really hit hard. And the nurse not even knowing who Hoffa was. It truly illustrated how insignificant he had become.

It reminded me of Henry Hill's fate in Goodfellas but 100x more brutal since Frank was too old to do anything except seek forgiveness that he knew he'd never get."
218,f93nqy4,"I feel like you're absolutely right about the trust. It's like the scene right after-- Hoffa having no idea of Frank's intent-- asking him if he has his piece on him. Even though he was upset at Frank probably for being 40 minutes late, he had to have been paranoid for his life and seeing Frank there even 40 minutes late convinced him that he was far more safe than he was before."
219,f94a15k,"Russ was trying to buy her affection with gifts and money, but all Hoffa had to do was create memories with her, like eating ice cream and playing mini golf. It shows what kind of men they were, and how they operated. The quiet mob boss that had everything versus the charismatic union president who demanded all eyes be on him. Great stuff."
220,f8xcqvd,"""Daddy told me not to take favors from the mob"""
221,f8xpbkp,"""Am I here to fucking amuse you?"""
222,f8v2tp7,Pesci’s last film in general. He had to be really convinced by De Niro and Scorsese to come out of retirement for this movie
223,f8wjy9n,Pesci is so fucking good in this movie.  Why did he stop acting for so long?
224,f8wak9u,His daughters knowing gaze throughout the entire movie was incredible
225,f8vvv6j,"That’s my response to people who have a problem with her lack of time. Her few lines and general absence serve a legitimate purpose, a purpose that would be cheapened by much more. She’s possibly the most important character in terms of the actual “point” of the story, it just wouldn’t make sense to give her more lines"
226,f8xuygq,"I feel like that must've been a hard thing to have had to act too. These guys themselves are approaching 80, and fuck me that's gonna be all of us someday"
227,f8v2gt4,I absolutely loved the movie but that scene looked ridiculous. And it could have been easily avoided by just using a body double. We saw him stomp out Billy Batts in Goodfellas which looked so animalistic and violent in comparison.
228,f8vg78b,"You can't de-age 70 year old men's bodies. That scene really stood out, but honestly any scene where Deniro and Pacino were supposed to be 40-50ish and they were walking anywhere just kept reminding me these guys were 70+. That and Deniro's stooped shoulders."
229,f8v0sl8,Its like Sam Jackson. You gotta get a body double for physical scenes like that.
230,f8vew05,"It looked like he was just letting his leg go limp on top of him, not actually kicking. Loved the movie, loved his performance, but that scene was just comical."
231,f8v39rm,"I know they paid for a posture coach to try to teach them how to walk like younger men, but it still comes through. Felt the same in Captain Marvel. You can de-age Sam Jack's face but that's clearly an old man running."
232,f8x5g27,I have no idea how old hes supposed to be in any scene. Even in the youngest parts he looks 50
233,f8v519k,"His arms made him look like a chicken, I had to look away."
234,f8vtelv,He and Pesci both look really really weird in the scene where they meet at the truck. Their bodies do not match their heads AT ALL
235,f8v16j7,It really stood out and was very awkward.
236,f8vj10o,Jimmy Hoffa used to call Bobby Kennedy that in real life
237,f8vrz2e,"I noticed the parallel between the two shots, and I definitely believe it was a callback to Goodfellas, but I read it differently. 

In Goodfellas, Pesci has an “Oh, No” moment, realizing his fate. 

In the Irishman, I think it just showed how arrogant Hoffa really was; he didn’t even take the time to look at the plastic on the floor. He just headed straight for the door. 

Hoffa was standing in his own grave like the German Soldiers earlier in the film, still believing that he could walk out alive."
238,f9fnfnm,All the while the actual physical acting completely betraying their 75+ year old selves.
239,f8wgk73,"Yep someone else commented it had an “end of an era” feel to it, I definitely agree especially in the last hour where it’s clear that his dedication to the mob cost him everything."
240,f8v41zf,"“That fuckin’ cocksucka Kennedy, he’s got his nose up my ass!!”"
241,f8x1c6v,Swedgin!
242,f8wltc0,"This is certainly up there with my my favorite performances of him. He was just such a colorful character, you could see how Pacino enjoyed playing Hoffa and I absolutely adored every second he was on screen."
243,f8xhnij,This was the best performance I've ever seen from him. Even better than Scarface imo
244,f8vz8d8,Yes! Finally someone mentioned the blue eyes. They looked so much glossier than everyone else’s.
245,f8vtixb,I'd say he could pass for late 30s-early 40s in the beginning scenes.
246,f8wr177,"There's a scene where one of his eyes looked sort of cat/lizardish, very odd."
247,f8wuyfr,"Pacino was my favorite actor in the movie. That being said, De Niro just has such a soulful face, I could watch him sit silently for hours."
248,f8v6xoy,"That scene where he called Jo nearly killed me, De Niro played it perfectly"
249,f8xtu0w,"I loved that scene, but is it just me or was there a weird cut in the beginning of that phone call? Like it cut Deniro mid-line. Just a minor thing."
250,f8w77r2,"I'd liken him to Nazi soldiers who excuse their cowardice because they're ""just doing what they're told"" and ""looking out for themselves.""

He's completely passive, yet that's what makes him so evil, because he lacks the conscience and will power to fight back when he's commanded to do something heinous. You can see that there's internal conflict the night before he shoots Hoffa because he's up late staring at the phone, but he's ultimately incapable of doing the right thing.

Russell knew as soon as Frank casually told the WWII story about shooting people that this is a guy who would do whatever he was told, and that's why he ""took a shine to him"". Frank was just a tool to use for his own ends. Russell had no genuine affection for him or humanity, in contrast to Jimmy, who was full of humanity. The contrast is revealed in the daughter's judgment, as she intuitively senses Russell's artifice.

For all the horrible tyrants and killers in history, their actions wouldn't be possible if they hadn't been enabled by passive participants like Frank, so this movie is an especially interesting portrait of evil because it focuses not on the mastermind, but rather on the cold foot soldier who just ""does what he's told""."
251,f8whsgo,"It's really quite incredible. A lot of movie epics are about exciting, meaningful lives, but this is an epic about a man whose life was an abject failure. He killed countless people who didn't inspire a drop of remorse in him, he betrayed his only real friend, he was worse than absent in his children's lives and he just slowly gets older and more decrepit and just loses everything. He can barely even get the nurse at the end to stick around and talk with him about the old days. This is an epic about a man slowly digging his own grave and having no choice but to accept it and lay down in the cold.   


Scorsese couldn't have crafted a better eulogy for the gangster film if he tried."
252,f8v9yki,If she doesn't win the Oscar for this...goddamn.
253,f8v4ksr,"Goodfellas and The Wolf of Wall Street are similarly lauded for how short their long run times feel, but they *much* easier material to work with on that front (cocaine fueled party scenes tend to make the time fly by). The fact that Schoonmaker pulled off a similar feat with *this* subject matter, an almost entirely joyless epic of one man's wasted, failed, life... is remarkable. Scorsese was careful to drain the ""joy"" from even the superficially celebratory scenes (like Frank's big banquet), and yet, this never felt like a slog (which even some movies I enjoy can feel like). The pacing of the movie was such a smooth glide, until the drawn out build up to the Hoffa killing, and the final act, both of which slow down quite a bit so you have to wallow in those moments. The editing definitely stood out to me among the film's great technical work."
254,f8z8ny9,That and watermelon soaked in booze.
255,f8vixft,"""There was an idea"""
256,f8w9miy,"""I got an offer you can't refuse.."""
257,f8wjxw2,"I thought of it as more of the fact that they specifically went away alone, because De Niro was sitting there alone due to his own choices, he could be sitting there with his children and family, but his life choices are the reason he’s sitting alone, he chose the mafia life over family and ended up alone"
258,f8vt8y8,"yeah i hope his performance gets a lot of recognition, because he absolutely nails who Frank Sheeran and just the expressions he displays, as well as that final half hour, are so convincing in showing his inner turmoil"
259,f916u48,I have never before seen an actor do such a shaky and emotional voice. Really amazing!
260,f8vo75b,I personally didn't think De Niro ever looked that young in the film. Something about his old man downturned corners of his mouth
261,f8vjryb,The bit where De Niro is kicking the grocer borders on hilarious
262,f8vu3rr,The only time I really minded was the part where he beat the guy up. They shoulda used a body double for that one.
263,f8vabul,"Excellent writeup. It's definitely about the unobserved life, which is why I think this is closer to Scorsese's catholic guilt films than it is Goodfellas or Casino (not that there aren't specific callbacks to those films). It's a lot like Raging Bull where Lamotta's inability to see the harm he's causing to his family tragically leads him to a point where it's too late to repent and have it matter. 

My only disagreement is that I do find the film wholly bleak. Obviously not all of us will die alone like Frank, but the ending has tinges of the same ending as Barry Lyndon: We're all destined for the grave, and that's a dark and lonely final destination."
264,f8xof99,"I don't know why no one is talking about how De Niro is a complete pawn between 2 men who he considers friends. Meanwhile, they consider him nothing but a workhorse, a solider, someone who will do whatever they need - because he is too loyal.

His loyalty is what screws him over, his loyalty to these 2 psychopaths is what ruins his life. He doesn't use the money to buy anything glamorous, to live a life of luxury. He says it wasn't about the money, all those hits were about paying respect. 

And in the end, what does he have to show for that loyalty? All his ""friends"" are dead, and he's lost his family due to that loyalty. 

Essentially, he was a mob workaholic."
265,f8vy05t,This is the best examination of this film's themes I've seen yet. I think Frank's refusal to allow himself feel emotions was expertly shown through De Niro's performance when Frank realizes he has to kill Hoffa. He seems to be on the verge of tears through that whole section of the film but stifles his feelings. I think that this film will only become better the more I think about it.
266,f8ysayl,"That's the thing: look a their plates. Frank's is still full of watermelon. He respects Hoffa enough to not touch it. And I think that's key: Hoffa's not stupid enough to not notice a drunk guy, nor not smell the Bacardi, especially when that goomba holds it up to his face and says ""Wanna bite?""

I think that's one of the things that endears him to Hoffa. It's a great way of showing it."
267,f8xlnrn,Real life. That is what is waiting down the line.
268,f8xd8so,I thought the dude with the glasses was gonna shoot him at any moment
269,f91hctv,"I think he just has the most youthful demeanor. The guy's still got some spring in his step; he's very alert and sharp. It's the incongruity between the way the characters move, and their appearance that causes issues in my opinion."
270,f8x2xej,"Saw it in the cinema, both The Irishman and I Heard You Paint Houses (which was the original title for a long time, and obviously the preferred one) show up at the end."
271,f8vgs1k,"Maybe it's just because the book that inspired the movie is called ""I Heard You Paint Houses"""
272,f8xypmh,"I think that’s when I realized what this movie truly was. It’s not a gangster flick but, an anti-gangster flick. I mean every time someone new is introduced they show their name, how they died, and what year they did. These guys thought they were gods of their time but in the end they’re all just human with an expiration date. It really hits it home with the last 30 minutes. Frank is left with nothing, no family, no friends, nothing to protect anymore, he still believes in what he did. But none of it mattered because he’s left with nothing."
273,f8v4fgu,That scene felt like it had such rich history - it carried that same DNA from those epic mob movies from the previous generation & we just got to see it one last time.
274,f8v4pze,"Netflix can try and claim that the prestige from this movie justifies the price tag, and I struggle to believe it... but I'm not complaining, this feels like a personal $150 milllion Christmas gift to me. Thanks Netflix.

Either they did some advanced calculations and realized that having another movie in Oscars contention would be sufficiently valuable for their business model it was worth the cost... or to me it seems more likely that the guy in charge of the purse strings is a lover of movies and was star struck by Scorsese and his demands. That's the narrative I'll go with until I hear otherwise."
275,f8w23iz,The butcher shop beating was bad. It looked like my grandfather trying to beat someone up. Really stiff and no believable power behind any kick or stomp.
276,f8v1do0,"don't laugh, you'll see!  is a heartbreaking line from pesci ...well all endup in the same place"
277,f8wcfjb,"Also, the fact that every time a mob figure was introduced we were instantly told about their end, and most of them were bloody and not full of glory."
278,f8x8cz1,"The ""life goes by fast"" line he said to the nurse when she didn't know who Hoffa was hit me so hard. I've been thinking a lot about that concept lately so for it to come up in the movie in such a way hit me hard.

As I get older, and im not even that old I just turned 30, time has been moving so much faster. It's getting faster and faster every year. I remember being a kid in school still and thinking a year was such a long time. Now a year feels like nothing. 5 years feels like a year used to. Its not a farfetched thought to me that one day ill be 80 thinking to myself, ""these 80 years have gone by way too fast"".

Time is the most valuable thing we have and one of those things youll never get back once its gone. Sucks."
279,f8xfz0j,"Dipping the bread in the ""good"" grape juice was a sad sight."
280,f911lkh,"Gesture of ""I'll give then to you when you get back"""
281,f9eveex,I think it was to force Frank to look Jimmy in the eye. If he was wearing shades Jimmy would have suspected something. He would look shady and suspicious.
282,f9morc8,Sunglasses were for vacay. Frank was going to work.
283,f91pcxt,Plus he had his wife.
284,f9eob49,He was probably just killing time shitposting on Reddit like the rest of us.
285,fawgzte,I'm that time he could have watched The Irishman
286,f9egg2k,"It's an alibi. He flies up there, whacks Hoffa, comes back, and drives up there with Russ.

Police ask any questions, he was still driving up to the Wedding, a statement he, Russ, the wives, and presumably the many other people they got money collections from on the way up there could verify."
287,f97x5al,Probably to be faster and avoid suspicion from the wives
288,f8xm747,"You can hear his voice just slightly crack on ""they wouldn't dare"" as deep down his whole body just realized they are ready to prepare to come at him."
289,f8whs1t,"The delivery by Pacino there is so good!

I can’t get this film out of my head, I feel privileged to have been able to watch it. It’s just such a great ending piece to the mob genre from Scorsese, Pacino, Pesci, and De Niro in their golden years. I’m just so damn happy that we even got this."
290,f9jnfbt,Pacino totally stole the movie amongst several great performances. Fantastic and at times hilariously funny. His hangup about wearing shorts to a meeting had me dying.
291,f902bw4,That would have been beneath Pesci that movie was entourage parody movie bad
292,f928oa1,They did him a favor. That movie was hot garbage
293,f8xixnr,What the fuck. That would have been something.
294,f8x5bee,Muddafucka*
295,f8xwyk9,"You sonuffabitch, I'm in!"
296,f8wfy9p,Just that you're a legend. You know.
297,f8z9r48,"Yup. He could have easily played Tony Pro and would have been his standard Scorsese role. But I am actually glad he played Russell, as it really shows his acting range.

To me this film was pure joy. Everyone did a great job."
298,f91wr8w,So true. He played a mobster boss but still was so much more humble and not the usual hot fuse.
299,f8vuz96,That and the fish conversation
300,f8xkate,"I wanted a lot more of him, he really only had one scene."
301,f93h2ay,"he's the lead in Scorsese's first great film, and it was a gangster movie. So he's pretty much the literal OG of Scorsese universe."
302,f8wz7q6,"He had such trust in his voice as well. The motion to the door... It really made me think this scene is going to endure longer. But those two shots in his back were a reality check (It reminded me how Frank is still a soldier deep down his soul and doesn’t know better).

So sad."
303,f91y4pg,"I kept hoping that Frank would change his mind, kill the small-timers and escape with Jimmy and their families somehow. Nobody won in this movie. I knew it wasn't gonna be all happy but damn that was some cold-ass friend killing.

I'm also just one of those guys who remembers that one flashback in the Godfather with all the Corleone brothers at dinner during happier times more vividly than any scene in the trilogy. That contrast between the warm past and the bleak future really hits me in these movies."
304,f91vpvj,I think he made a noise after the first shot too
305,f8xlr7m,[deleted]
306,f8ypurf,It definitely is Frank shooting Jimmy. You can see his signet ring and Jimmy's red polo shirt. Honestly a good catch.
307,f8yxas1,"I thought it was going to culminate in a murder at the wedding, but nope it was Jimmy Hoffa. I’m so glad I went into this knowing nothing."
308,f91ydfc,"That is so fucking amazing. I would never have noticed that, getting all distracted by that song in the background."
309,f9889qe,"This really wasn’t a film of twists. Its plot wasn’t designed to blindside you. Pretty much no one is killed without it explicitly being said beforehand that they will be, so by the time Russell tells Frank that Jimmy has to go, there’s no doubt that it’s going to happen. Frank was never treated as any sort of hero, or even as the sort of person who could have a noble change of heart; that’s just not the story that’s being told.

When Jimmy gets in that car, you know he’s going to his death, and yet it’s still no less shocking when it comes, because the physical act itself is so violent and so sudden; it’s over in an instant, and this man who Frank was so close to is dead. No honor, no dignity, no ceremony."
310,f8yf3cm,The real Irishman were the friends we lost to cancer along the way.
311,f9hyul0,It did in mine!
312,f8wwsux,I think so
313,f9oq38h,"Yes, that call - in which he feigned ignorance and left Jimmy's wife Jo second-guessing what happened to Jimmy - was eating him up more than the fact that he killed Jimmy, since that seemed a done deal (""we did everything we could do for the man""), regardless of his participation. 

It was also the call that Peggy referred to when she asked ""Why?"" followed by ""Why didn't you call her?"", indicating that she was aware that he not only killed Jimmy (arguably out of duty or as a mercy killing), but also was about to betray Jimmy's wife and family."
314,f8xujwa,Yes
315,f90e93y,The *good* kind of grape juice (;
316,f8xdcod,"Or they were uncomfortable and laughed to release tension. 

My showing was dead silent but I can imagine it happening that way."
317,f8xy0xu,I think it was because of how old they were. That they got a preference in grape juices is kinda old guy retirement home humour
318,f8w3p3s,Tony Jack
319,f8xp9tg,At least it ended well for one guy
320,f8ypqeo,There was a huge shakeup in Cosa Nostra during the 1980’s. It was practically a fucking bloodbath. Check out “Nicky Scarfo.” This fucking guy killed more people cancer.
321,f967mqp,Aw man. I remembered when my dad used to tell me shit from his past. Always paid very close attention to his stories. I considered it part of this secret history that only few people get to know.
322,f8wj53t,"So if I understood it correctly, neither of them were the church going type. Sure they were there for the baptism, but what makes Frank chuckle is the image of Russell trying to redeem his soul by going to church?
But it doesn’t take too long and soon it’s Frank who’s there talking to the priest and feeling remorseful."
323,f93m80w,The part where Frank goes to the bank to see his daughter and she instantly nope out of there though :(
324,f92wtnj,"It felt like a goodbye from Scorsese to gangster movies. We'll never see a crime movie like Goodfellas, Casino, The Departed or The Irishman again. The last hour felt like Pesci, De Niro and Scorsese saying adios to the viewer. Great movie"
325,f9n2r9f,The sad thing is that he and Frank WERE going to be in trouble if it wasn't for Russ making Frank himself do the hit.
326,f9kwrtb,At least he had more sense than Tommy DeVito and his immediate reaction was to get the fuck out instead of just standing there deer-in-headlights
327,f94sv1p,"I don’t think it was meant to be a symbolic of Frank and Sally’s experience. It’s symbolic of Chuckies experience picking up Frank, Jimmy, and Sally. Just like picking up the fish, he doesn’t ask any questions about picking the guys up and just does as he’s told. The fish scene just reinforces Chuckies ignorance of what’s truly going on."
328,f9umsah,"In an interview, Scorsese explained that he pressed Chucky about the fish because he needed to know all of the details in case something went wrong, so that he wouldn’t look like he was lying. 

Something goes wrong, this gangster tries to explain the fish thing but then says he doesn’t know what type of fish, then maybe people don’t believe him, and he gets whacked. Scorsese wanted to emphasize how paranoid these men could be and how close they were to being killed at all times. 

So basically, the guy was just trying to cover his own ass, as he explains himself in the scene: “If someone asks me, I want to be able to tell them.” Or however he puts it. Also this is the dialogue as it happens in the book."
329,f90tle8,I thought Chuck just had a dirty sex in the car that is why he could not remember any details about the fish lol
330,f8xvcmh,Expensive ones too
331,f924fwv,That line was jaw dropping
332,f941elj,/r/HolUp moment right there
333,f964dsh,There was an omitted subplot where Frank delivered rìles exactly similar to the one used in the Kennedy assassination. Guess truth is stranger than fiction.
334,f9kvwqk,"Also love how the ""a little concerned...in fact, more than a little concerned"" line came full circle when Frank was talking to Jimmy"
335,f9bs348,"""According to some people."""
336,f8y16ur,"I once watched an interview with an ex high ranking member of the Colombo crime family who operated in the 70’s and 80’s mostly. A guy named Michael Franzese. His father Sonny Franzese is also a lifelong mobster who’s still alive today at 102 years old. Anyway, in the interview this guy Michael says that Jimmy Hoffa’s killer is still alive today and in prison. He also mentions that he knows where Hoffa’s final resting place is and that it’s “wet”. I don’t know why but I’m inclined to believe him. He has nothing to gain by making that up as far as I can tell."
337,f94trh6,"That’s a great point, I actually think this is why Frank sat in the back as well. Towards the end he says he always felt a bit sympathetic towards Chuckie, It’s possible he probably thought Sally Bugs intended on wacking Chuckie after he and Jimmy got out of the car to go into the house. He had served his purpose, Frank also mentioned something along the lines of three people can only keep a secret if two are dead."
338,f8v8emr,Pacino killed that scene.
339,f8xkdu9,"Same here. Fantastic scene. I also laughed out loud at Pacino's perfect, genuinely exasperated delivery of ""HOW DO YOU DO THAT?!!"" in the ""I'm sitting in a room full of fucking idiots"" rant."
340,f9b88de,The fact that it happened in a court. Like everyone in the court just became his disciples for a short while.
341,f8vhr4n,"""motherfucking goddamn orange peeled beef"""
342,f920fgb,"No way, that's a Paulie line on par with ""Ton, if you gave this guy a golf club he'd probably try to fuck it"""
343,f8xfs0i,I feel like Pacino forgot his lines for a second when chewing out his staff in his office.  He leaned over the desk and appeared to look off set.  Only to reel it in and make it part of the scene.  I could be seeing things but that's how it appeared to me.

347,f8v1mu7,"Highly doubt it. Think it was just his way of closing the chapter on gangster movies.

He seems like he has still has the zest for life tbh,which is quite admirable."
348,f8v2yot,"Definitely not his last movie, he's still working at full speed. This year, he produced several other big releases, made a separate documentary with Netflix, and always seems to be in talks for other projects. I'm sure he'll dial his work back before he stops entirely."
349,f8vik5g,"Hes shooting Killers of the Flower in a few months, he ain’t stopping"
350,f9i0jte,"He was good. I think Romano showed he had more range when he was doing that TNT show, Men of a Certain Age. It was weird seeing him and Pacino/DeNiro in the same scenes, but he held his own and seemed natural."

359,f992i03,"> Pacino understands what he’s saying, kind of, but won’t budge.

It's a perfect parallel to De Niro talking about how the enemy soldiers just wouldn't stop digging their own grave."

But to show this whilst (for the most parts) the character's are living their life, having a good time with all their riches and you learn that they 'get shot' or whatever goes to show how ultimately futile the whole thing really is."
368,f8xrnse,"That’s the right term that I’ve been struggling to put a finger on... meditation on a wasted life. A life where Frank never picked family first and lives only with regrets. What kind of man makes that call he asks, because that’s the only question that stays with him. What a gut punch. He’s the guy that made it, the guy that outlived them all, but he’s still living in the past so what’s it worth? The movie ends with him asking to leave the door open, because that door to the past is what he has left.... and it isn’t helpful but he clings to the only thing he has and it’s what he deserves, the pain of a wasted life where his success by definition meant his failure"
369,f93rr1s,"Just makes it all the more heartbreaking, but what choice did Jimmy leave him, and the rest of them?"

373,f8w3suw,The way they used her character is the most effective possible way they could’ve used her character. People that complain about her relationship with Frank being underdeveloped missed the point entirely
374,f8wcyp1,"My feeling exactly, what did she need to say? She conveyed all of the emotion and we knew exactly where she was coming from without a bunch of dialogue.

They made a big point of her being scared by mob figures like Russ but being enamored and loving Jimmy and knowing the truth. It was very clear and expanding on that would be unnecessary and show less respect for the audience."
375,f8y6tc5,Also when he threw the two guns in the lake (not the river ones) and tossed them two feet with no ability to use his shoulders it seemed. My first thought was “those guns went like a foot haha”

384,f8xp4f2,Yeah when Pesci called him 'kid' in the scene where they first met was unintentionally/intentionally? pretty hilarious.

396,f8vtewh,"That was so visibly old man like, it was comical."
397,f8vg4bn,"> My only disagreement is that I do find the film wholly bleak. Obviously not all of us will die alone like Frank, but the ending has tinges of the same ending as Barry Lyndon: We're all destined for the grave, and that's a dark and lonely final destination.

Yeah, I think the interpretation of the ending is bound to be especially personal (and I feel it's intended to be fairly ambiguous, whereas the rest of the movie was fairly direct). If you want to try and put yourself in the shoes of authorial intent (which is interesting, although far from the only way to see it), I think it gets especially messy, because Scorsese and his actors *are* at the end of their careers, so you can't say anything about the future ""not yet being written"". And yet, no one could ever accuse Scorsese for living a thoughtless life... he's devoted his entire career to introspection and the deconstruction of these tropes. So I know how the ending made me feel as I left the theater, but I imagine it will play *very* differently depending on your own personal age and concerns.

The comparison to Barry Lyndon is very interesting... hadn't considered it! The parallels between the main characters absolutely fit–both are thoughtless, passive men, who rise and fall in an epic tragedy which tears apart their family. In particular, neither seem to feel meaningful agency over their life choices, and the resulting movie is this strange epic where the protagonist is like a passive observer to their own story. It's probably not a coincidence that Barry Lyndon is also one of my favorites.

I certainly see Barry Lyndon as unambiguously bleak, although I think that's because I see the endings as somewhat distinct. To me, the nail in the coffin which makes Barry Lyndon so completely hopeless is the fact that in the final duel, Barry's choice to shoot the ground is a moment of genuine agency. It's perhaps the only moment in the movie where he takes his fate fully in his own hands, and he doesn't just follow it blindly. And, of course, because this decision seems to lead to nothing but his own tragic end, you walk away feeling like ""fate"" is perhaps just out of our control, and Barry's agency was just naivety, and none of us really control our own destiny, we just live and then we die. And it's very grim. 

To me, I see The Irishman as a lot more ambiguous, because its climax is simply his worst moment of passivity (in killing Hoffa). Basically, Scorsese leaves open to the audience the idea that Frank could have made his own decisions, and lived a better life, whereas Kubrick reminds you that ""You might think you're no Barry, but would it really matter in the end?"". Of course, that's also just one narrow reading of Barry Lyndon (I've generally seen it as a movie about as a passive man who rises and falls according to the whims of fate, and none of his actions particularly matter), so your mileage may vary on BOTH fronts. I'd probably have to think about it more (I like the comparison of the protagonists), but for now at least that's why I see The Irishman as much more ambiguous (in its ending, it doesn't feel like a terribly ambiguous movie for the rest of it)."

399,f8w5s6k,"150M is peanuts for Netflix and this is a major piece of content with prestigious names. It also serves as counterprogramming to all the feel good crap Disney will be churning out. There are certain types of stories Disney will never tell, and if you're in competition with them then it makes sense to occupy that space yourself to meet the demand."
400,f90kfte,It seemed like most of them got wacked 79-81. Was there something special about the Italian mafia during those years?
401,f8yss2n,"that was one of my favorite parts, dudes who show up for less than a minute and it says their death just randomly. A great touch"
402,f8xraed,I liked how Scorsese gave Joe Kennedy the same treatment.

""Boy, that went fast"""
405,f8y9jym,"Well said. It still had all the elements of Goodfellas or Casino etc, but Scorsese imbued it with that somber atmosphere, every moment was overshadowed by death. And the deaths were not ritualistic or emphasised. 

It happens and you’re gone and the next thing happens, that’s time. And all the nuance and relevance you hold to it falls through your hands the older you get, before you know it, you’re lost.

It’s like the tunnel at the end of the light."
406,f923l9j,Try to do different things and make new memories. It's how I slow down my life. Mix things up. Try out new restaurants. Join clubs to meet new people. Be open to new experience.

412,f8y8bsf,"There's a brief moment where he realises it and his face turns into scared shitless, before going back to his 'bully' persona. Incredible acting by Pacino."
413,f8xmw3a,I think that's what makes it so brilliant. It's the integrity of the thing and he won't back down despite how bad it is. And he still tries to keep his composure with desperate threats.
414,f92zgej,"holy fuck!  i remember grasping at that and legit thinking 'am i over reading this?', 'is this acting that fucking next level?'

i swear im not trying to hype this film and overpraise.

infact i initially was going 'meh' right when it ended and thr last 48hrs i have been getting recalls on an endless amount of scenes that i am blown away on even the fact that i can recall so many for a movie. it speaks volumes"

418,f9pk7ps,"Yet at the same time I felt so intimidated by his character. Like it was obvious physically he couldn’t hurt anyone but the quiet demeanor was really scary. Like when he wouldn’t tell Frank his name at the gas station, it was like, “Oh, this guy’s big.”"

425,f8xpxv1,"I didn't see Frank's character as remorseful. Like when he's talking with the priest, he isn't able to muster up regret for the choices he's made, which seemed completely true to character. It seemed like he turned to religion because he no longer had anything to live for on earth and so he  turned his focus to the afterlife to give the rest of his years some sort of purpose - like when he's talking about what material his casket will be."
426,f8xu14d,"There are also parallels in how he mentions that he prayed when he was facing death/scared during the war; then, the next time we see him pray is when he’s possibly afraid and facing death again."
427,f94tk8v,"Totally! I think it works in that way too, and that’s sort of what I meant to say as well (albeit poorly). I think it works for the general ‘job’ mentality behind it all - everything Chuckie does, *and* Sally, and Frank, etc. etc.

435,f8w464e,Pacino killed every scene he was in.  It was awesome watching these long-slumbering greats actually give a fuck again.
436,f911y1f,I thought so too. But I think it was supposed to be him looking at Frank and that's why he walked out. When Jimmy came out and said he wasn't talking about Frank it was supposed to be a lie.  I'm probably wrong though.
437,f8zxzpb,"I dont, but im going to learn now."
438,f8w04is,"I saw a little sit-down press junket he did with De Niro and Pacino, and he looked like he was having the time of his life just *talking* about a movie."

That was the only scene missing from the movie. AB drinking wine with Frank and Russ."
443,f8ypjb1,Yeah same here. Very few made it to their natural end. The money or whatever else they got from living that life wasn't worth it.
444,f8ywnw5,"I thought leaving the door open was something he got from Jimmy. When Jimmy insists Frank sleeps at his place when he first arrives, Frank notices how he slightly keeps the door ajar before going to bed. I'm not sure if Frank ever understood the meaning of it, but it shows the impact Jimmy had on Frank's life."
445,f8w2r29,"Yeah, if it is his last film at least he went out on a high note"
446,f8w10bu,I honestly believe that Pesci put in the best performance. I was always waiting for his next scene.
447,f8wd87f,"I think there may be some frustration that they never went deeper into her character or something, but given that the movie is all based on narration from Frank’s POV, we wouldn’t know anything about her character"
448,f9hf4eo,Even him just walking on the rocks in that scene showed the lack of balance that an old timer would have.
449,f94lt2o,"So I just did some googling and the character is supposed to be in his mid 30s in that truck scene. Definitely does not look like it! 

He was somewhat believable as a man in his mid 40s. But Russell/Pesci calling him ""kid"" was kind of ridiculous! I appreciate the effort, tho. It's hard when it's an actor we've seen at those ages since he was in his 30s."

458,f90wv3a,I know Bruno getting killed in ‘80 was the start of a lot of bloodshed. Otherwise I think it’s a lot of typical mob stuff.

The whole scene started as pretty typical gangland movie stuff, but I loved when he said ‘bc if somebody asks I gotta be able to explain this’ . I loved his character bc usually that character is just filler, no depth. But  he played that brilliantly and his facial expressions were brilliant the whole time first with chuckle but then especially with Jimmy on some ‘yea you keep joking but you don’t even know you gettin popped in 5 minutes’"
469,f90vwbe,Definitely. You could see it was eating him up in the car ride to the house.
470,f8zc5jc,I agree. If he has any regrets is not having a relationship with his kids. But in his mind I don't think he could have done anything differently either way.

475,f8zzol9,He was a higher up in the CIA and a massive deal in the Nixon admin during Watergate. What we saw when he was on the TV was him testifying in front of Congress. Actually happened. Can't recall if he was one of the guys caught lying for Nixon or not though.
476,f938h7q,"I saw him talk in a career retrospective in LA. He is so interesting and entertaining to listen to. Remembers so many details about his movies, shooting locations, how he's met everyone, etc. Joy to hear him discuss film."

478,f8woee7,"His acting as the old old man in prison was scary realistic.

My father's in federal prison with a bunch of old ex mafia guys and he told me 3 years ago that he spends his time pushing this old mafia guy around in a wheelchair to church and to play bocce ball. Then I see EXACTLY THAT in the movie. Somebody did their homework because that was so real. Along with Pescis amazing acting...top notch shit. Amazing movie."
479,f8w9h8r,"The scene where Frank gets shit from Keitel’s character for almost knocking over the laundromat for Whispers (the other Whispers), Russ doesn’t say a word and his face doesn’t give away *anything*. Fuckin ice cold."
480,f8wdbv1,That’s a great point. He wasn’t close with his daughter and was estranged from her and didn’t know her because of the life he led. So why would we know anything?

Yep.

We know what De Niro looked like when he was young. He looked like a young man. The most you can say here is that Frank looked like a very old 40something."

488,f8xbcy9,"I was just thinking that. My dad passed due to diabetes complications 4 years ago, and for the few years before that he had a few strokes, and Pesci’s character after he had a stroke really hit home for me way too much."

490,f94k53z,I almost had him!
491,f92fzn2,It's because they both trust Frank so much.
492,f92sw3s,"In the end this is what confused me the most, too. I get that he trusted him, but in the aftermath, doesn’t that mean that the son is a witness to who was involved? Why wouldn’t they want to take him out as well? It seems risky to let him go- and these are people who aren’t predisposed to taking risk. 

I read a bit of the real story and his son was questioned in the disappearance and seemed to be a suspect. There was no implication in the movie that his son ever had any animosity toward his father, so in the context of the film his loyalty should have been grounds for the mafia to include him in the assassination."
493,f930n3r,"Exactly what I was getting at.

The news reported that his son was talking and trying to find his father.

Wouldn’t he have told officers and his mom that he dropped his dad and frank off at that house? Frank would be a prime suspect.

I mean he probably did but they glossed over it all."
494,f9358tl,I thought for sure Sal was going to kill Chucky. When I first watched I thought Frank didn’t want Sal sitting in the back to protect Chucky instead of himself knowing Chucky was innocent in everything

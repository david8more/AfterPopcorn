Ever wondered what it’s like to be a pilot during the evacuation rather than just the soldiers on the beach? You got it. Or a civilian helping them? Sure thing! And what’s great is that there’s barely CGI in the film to make it so that you are in the moment too.

As much as anyone says this was a very realistic experience of a war, I disagree. Personally, I didn't find any real desperation in any character in the movie. Not a single character. Yes they were all trying to survive but there was no emotion, no real tension. The tension displayed was a top down approach of looking at war while being bedazzled by technical wizardry and realistic setpieces. (No blood PG13 was a counter-productive decision).
I understand that this movie doesn't want to highlight character arcs to show the futility and the epic-madness of war. But any character in focus, at any moment, feels so robotic. There is no real fear or anger or desperation. Even common sense is sacrificed sometimes to paint a poetic scene (ironic for a movie that wants to scream real). In the opening scene for example, the soldiers try to outdo bullets by running in a straight line. Not one looks back to judge the position of enemies to duck or change course. A survival depending adrenaline rush makes one more aware of ways to survive. All this because Nolan had this scene etched in his mind so deeply to signify how one character who survives the shooting is a random character. But there were better ways. And on that note, there are better war movies.
I know I am an average simpleton and not an auteur. And I am a big fan of Nolan's works. But no artist is perfect.",none,,2021-03-08 16:29:34.444801,1

In 2001, we Don't get a character with a nice complete emotional Arc because the film is more about the evolution of Humanity and focusing on one character for an emotional Arc would detract from that. If we focused Heavily on One person in Dunkirk, it would've been about one man's journey home rather than 400000 People.",none,,2021-03-08 16:29:34.445482,0

I don't find the acting believable. People would certainly talk in such a situation. People always talk and there is nothing else to do. They are just standing around on the beach waiting for ships. 
The plotline with the small boat was awful, the patriotic moments were corny, the ""oh no, I fell and slightly bumped my head and now I might be dead"" moment felt as if it were taken out of a film from the 50s.
But worst of all: The score was TERRIBLE and if you really want to buy that shit on CD, try to get hold of a distorted version of the worst song of Justin Biber while you're at it, because Biber certainly will sound better! Just think of the long crescendo while random boy who looks like a moron runs to small boat, and when he arrives, the crescendo just peters out. And it was not even a good crescendo. A really shitty cliché unimaginative string crescendo that leads nowhere, has no justification and ends just as senselessly as it began. And that is pretty much how the whole score sounds. One big really bad sound effect. Indeed, it gets into your head, but Justin Biber does that too! I've never seen a film with such a lousy score that is at the same time so much in your face all the time. You have to be deaf to like this film or not know shit about music.
I'll give you that the dog fights were cool, but that's it. 
This film is shit. As a silent film, I'd give it a D+ or maybe a C- because of the originality. With the sound on, I'd give it an F.",none,,2021-03-08 16:29:34.798303,0

 That perfect beach with no damage ? 
Those dogfight who were impossible ? 
The little ship lie ? 
The no bombing or artillery strike on the beach ?(they were constatly attack by the german) 
The fact that Nolan do not say  anything about the British cowardness who left the french and belge behind without even say anything to them ? 
The perfect city who hasn't got any damage ? 
The thing that the city was constantly on fire and so that reduce a little the german bombing ? 
The no talk about the french who fought till the end to protect the british from more tha  200 000 germans ? 
The thing that the guy who got bomb in the film didn't even drop any blood ?
 The BIG difficulty to get to the beach between the luftwaffe and the corps and destroyed boat for obstacle ? 
The non presence of the british AND french aircraft ? 
The german bomber who doesn't supposed to be that low ? 
The thing that the bf109 wasn't firing to the spitfire ? 
The thing that the spit took many bullet un the engine and got just a little jauge problem ? 
The thing that the bf109 could  shotdown the spit but just go away after the first attack ? 
The thing that he didn't give a fuck that a 109 shot him ? 
The thing that the first scene is impossible ? 
The border who are not defended and that the german coumd cross the beach to destroy the french, belge and british army ? 
The thing that thay didn't talk about the britsh firing to the french who tried to get on the boat ? 
The thing that the british officer didn't obey to the churchill order ? 
The inacurate stuka dive ? 
The thing that they don't aim for the bridge but prefer attack the guy on the beach ? 
The artillery shells (that we just saw one time in the movie) that don't even do a single noise in the air ? 
The thing that the soldier where waiting in the water but that the little ships were not arrived ? 
The thing that the boad shouldn't sink just after only one bad aim bomb hit ?
 The thing that during the battle between allies and axie, the british lost 2000 men the french 16000 ? 
The thing that the french were fighting at 1 vs 20 (30 sometimes!!)? 
The thing that french surrender only cause of the lact of ammunition ? 
The thing that the beach should have been full of trucks, cars and other military thing ? 
The thing that cause of the brits the french couldn't counter attack ? 
The house that sould have not been like this ?
AND that at the end we could see and here the british oficer saying that he will ""stay with the french"" bjt that in real life curchill say to thlse 3 english division to stay and defend with the french but that they run away and left the french army behind after everything they've done for them ?

I think I may be standing alone in this viewpoint. But I quite nearly absolutely hated Dunkirk. I give a D+. What saves this film to some degree are the realism in shots like the dogfights. I understand that the point of this movie is the event... but the event itself is about the people. Not necessarily the 400,000 evacuees either. Dunkirk as a story is about the 40,000 people who fought the rear guard action knowing that they were going to lose but desperately trying to hold on for five days or five hours or even five minutes longer to allow more of the army to survive. They did this knowing for days that they were sacrificing their lives. The story is also about the chaos of the evacuation which is woefully under represented. On the beach, we have these lovely lines of people waiting patiently (and at times scared) for their turn to hop on the boats... wow isn't that pretty. But that isn't the truth of the chaos. Where is all the equipment, all the weapons, all the garbage from four hundred thousand people? We get one shot up boat on the beach... what about the trucks, tanks, transports, etc, etc? It's just all missing and the ""event"" lacks for it. The story is about the scale of the evacuation which is also woefully underrepresented. It really bothered me that for all the embedded feeling I was supposed to get, I never even came close to seeing the scale of the evacuation. Nolan showed me a couple thousand... Nolan showed me the Trump inauguration crowd but Dunkirk should have looked more like the March on Washington crowd. The other huge issue for me is that yes, there were nearly 400,000 on the beach at Dunkirk, but we are left with impression that everyone was saved. Not true, only about 350,000 were evacuated. And yes, several thousand died... but even more were captured by German forces, which is also part of the complaint. In Nolan's film, you never get a sense of just how desperate the situation is. You never see just how close the German army is (you do see the equivalent of a squad). As a result, I was kind of bored. Dunkirk the event is a rich tapestry of human survival and sacrifice, all I got in Nolan's film were a few tidy lines and some real boats and planes. Honestly, if the only thing Nolan was interested in was the presentation of war without the trappings and human connections, the genre he should have chosen is called documentary. He could have directed a 30 minute episode of ""This Day in History"" and accomplished exactly the same thing. Big ups to the director of photography Hoyte Van Hoytema for his visual spectacle, wonderful camera angles, color scheme, and accomplishing exactly what the director wanted. I just think what the director wanted... was not good. D+",none,,2021-03-08 16:29:35.265105,1

In fact this is a ""very"" badly directed movie.

- No introduction in any form or shape as to how the British ended up on the beaches.
- Apparently the Germans never saw action at Dunkirk (apart from a lost plane)
- The same sequences were recycled over and over (plane and ship scenes)
- Empty beaches, really? (not a single piece of reference material was used to make this movie. The beaches were stuffed with material that had to be left behind)

These are just the things i can think of right now on top of my head.
This movie has been so badly done it feels more like a cheap money grab. The movie should not only put you in the action but it should also tell a story and educate people of what actually happened as it's based on a real life event.

The people that served in the war, the ones that lost their lives those days and the ones that like a bit of history ""should"" be disappointed with this movie as it's only half baked.
Just having a few good actors doesn't make it a good movie.

Just my two cents

3. It lacks emotional punch that required in certain scenes. Ex- The scene when civilians arrive with their boats and Naval Commander says ""Home"". I think that scene deserved to be little melodramatic but it wasn't, that's why I couldn't feel the relief that soldiers felt when civilians arrived with their boats. Bombing scenes were great no doubt about it and Hans Zimmer score certainly helped.

I want to share one thing I felt.
Sometimes, at the end of movies, I ask myself: ""Do you feel changed by it?"", because I feel like that's an important thing I want to know about myself. And so I did with this one. The credits were still rolling, and I asked myself ""Do you feel changed by it?"" And sadly, the answer was no. I enjoyed very much the part about the kid, and it was amazing by a visual point of view, but it's been an hour since the film ended, and the rest of it has gone.
I'm not implying any judgment here. It's just the way I felt. 
And it keeps happening to me with movies, you see, and I sort of think the reason is that some movies tend to look more and more like documentaries these days. You know, all those real planes, real boats, real people doing real things - not in this case, but it happens. 
And again, I'm not saying this is wrong, because I don't believe in that. At the end of the day, it all depends on what strikes you the most, and there's not much you or anyone else can do about it.
But you know, documentaries are docuementaries, and they can move me, but that's not the point; and movies are movies, and they can show me the real thing, but is that the point?",none,,2021-03-08 16:29:35.688039,0

It’s more of a true event where group of young soldiers who fought WWII in one area while the German planes attack every individual and few British planes are here to take them down and also a rescue boat crews are here to save them, if they find hope to save the entire army. That’s what I love about this movie and I prefer this one more than “Interstellar” any day. Say what you want about this movie, but it is a bit underwhelming and the whole sci-fi is too much exhibition and boring pace. This movie have a perspective of what you see these young soldiers must find a safe place to keep them alive so that way they have be rescue and must run immediately before Germans come to attack and there’s no hope to be safe. Some people will disappoint that it’s not a great movie and the whole presentation that they’ve seen was a bit water down and the whole scenes were a bit rushed and it needs more to understand about “Dunkirk.” But that’s what it is and Nolan stated that in his social commentary that everything is based of how soldiers must survive in this war and it proves much better that we feel about this disastrous war. It’s actually a better movie and it wasn’t make it too low that none of IMBD or Rotten Tomatoes will make higher so I’m glad it’s not making too much hype so that was that.

Dunkirk is not a war film. Having an original war film it is bound to have much character development as it is generically the story about one person and their own fight and experiences of war.. generic war films can only be told in a way that intends to educate the audience of the nature of war. Questions such as ""are the allies just as morally wrong as the enemy?"" ""Who has the moral high ground in war.""   films like Hacksaw Ridge are intended to answer such questions as the perspective is limited to one/group of characters. Generic war films are intended to show this brutality and have the audience question morality, to educate and show the true nature. 
Where Dunkirk is different. It is solely intended to be a survival film. No one on that beach was thinking whether or not the Germans were just as morally wrong than the Allies. It was only one thing and that was survival. 
Did you realise that the 'enemy' was never identified. Even when Tom Hardy's character is captured the Germans are blurred and not at the forfront. The moment when the enemy is shown it takes the focus/scope on the survival of the soldiers. It removes the tension/fear.
If Dunkirk was set solely on one character and his/her character's journey and experience during the evacuation the scope would be very limiting.. Nolan uses this film as a wide scope on the massive event that took place both on the ground, at sea or in the air. This film is about the fight for survival for 400,000 solider not just for one. An outstanding masterclass, definetly one of Nolan's greatest pieces",none,,2021-03-08 16:29:36.104970,0

TL;DR: great movie, great director, great way to show what happened, war sucks, the end.

Now, if you have time to read a whole lot of words, and are interested in what I, a random person from the interwebs, has to say, here's my oppinion:

I love how you get what the movie is about. Like you said, It isn't a cliché war movie about people and THEIR stories in the bigger picture, aka the second World War. It's a movie about one of Hitler's greatest faults (giving the Allied forces a chance to evacuate) and how the evacuation happened, about the people, the spirit that made the avacuation possible. I once heard a quote (from Stalin, I know, sorry) saying: ""A single death is a tragedy, a milion deaths is a statistic"", and in a way, he was right. This event was a frickin miracle, only possible because of Hitler's stupidity at the time, but it gets far from enough recognition, perhaps because ""not enough"" people died on the shores of Dunkirk, yet around 360 THOUSAND lives were saved. Even where I live, in Belgium, the country where it bloody HAPPENED (I know, I'm wrong, see the edit), it's barely talked about. Even in history classes ABOUT the 2nd Great War. The only thing I ever learned about this in school was that Hitler made a mistake, he didn't take action against the soldiers on the shores of Dunkirk fast enough, which gave them the time to escape and ultimately play a part in our victory. I think one of the few places this event is actually well known would be England... So I love how this movie shows it to the world. Simple, as facts. Not as a tear jerker, not as a personal drama, but as a loss for the Allies, that got turned into a semi victory because of all the soldiers that were saved, that ultimately played a pretty damned big part in the Allied victory of the second Great War (pretty cold to think about it like this, but purelly objective and numerically speaking, the extra soldiers that otherwise would have been lost, helped a tremendous amount).
But that's just my 2 cents.
Anyways, greatings from Belgium (the tiny little mess wedged between Germany, France and the Netherlands).
Sorry if I offended anyone with the way I put some things, I know I can be a bit too cynical sometimes. I have nothing but respect for all those people who gave their lives their countries, for their families, and for the freedom and justice for everyone.

Edit: I know Dunkirk isn't actullay in Belgium so the movie didn't technically happen here, but it's only about 15km from the border, from where I live it isn't even a 2 hour drive, my grandparents (who lived during the 2nd War) live less than 70km from Dunkirk. Even these grandparents, who have told me some stories about the war (only those stories that weren't too painful for them), only mentioned Dunkirk to me about 2 or 3 times for as far as I can remember... What I'm trying to say is this: for such a huge, important event in the 2nd Great War, it is far too obscure, not even close to enough people know about it. Even fricking Pearl Harbor, which happened pretty much on the other side of the world, is better known, and in my humble opinion, that's a shame.

Edit 2: This one's about the effect of the movie... Sorry, I just love this movie and its subject so much I've got to keep talking it. Nolan brilliantly uses cinema to just throw you right in the middle of it. Despite the pretty much non-existant character arcs you can relate to every single person on that beach, also probably because of the amazing sound design... I say ""despite"", but in my oppinion his choice to NOT focus on character, to NOT have a lot of dialogue, to work with next to no dialogue compared to other war movies, actually helped to relate to the characters. Not because you had a personal connection to them or understood their motives, as you would in e.g. Saving Private Ryan, but because by doing this he generalized the soldiers. And I mean that in a good way. By not focussing on a single person, on a single storyline, but showing us the reactions and sheer fear of every single person on that beach, he managed to convey the terrors of war as I have rarely seen before on the screen. Also, by not showing the Germans (they were hardly even mentioned), he made them ""unpersonal beings"", an abstract fear. Just as the soldiers praying for their lives on the beach of Dunkirk, we too don't really see the enemy. We too don't see the person shooting at ""us"" (us being the soldiers ofc), we too can NOT put a face on the enemy, make them concrete, make them ""real"" in our personal world. They're just... there... everywhere... Bullets may come from every single side, except from the sea, ""our"" only opportunity to escape. Setting up the movie like this lets us feel a connection to ALL soldiers that were on that beach nearly 80 years ago, even without backstories, even though we know next no nothing about them, we empathize with all of them.
And THAT is what makes this movie so great in my humble, amateur movie watcher, eyes.

Okay, end of rant, if you read through all of this, thank you very much. 

Peace <3

I was watching the clock and just waiting for the bloody thing to hurry up and end. Every time a a bomb exploded and a bunch of people died I just thought to myself, oh look another explosion, I just don’t care anymore. The music was annoying and repetitive and it was like they were trying to create tension with it, but there’s nothing tense about the movie at all because I didn’t care about the characters.

Well then Sir, you know the movie is a bit shit lol. A lot the dialog is ropey, the aspect ratio jumps around the whole time and not in some dynamic clever way, but in a stop-doing-that-shit way (jumping aspect ratio is typical for Nolan films, but it especially doesn't work in this film with all the light backgrounds: sea; air; beach). For many of the close up scenes with seniority on the pier the direction simply isn't believable and while, yeah, the music builds to add suspense, it's a very generic, annoying and one of the most unimaginative scores in recent times. The only saving grace comes at the end when Hardy lands his plane and the music improves somewhat to some concluding voiceover cheese, but then they even manage to botch the very final edit of the film to an amateurish degree cutting back to the character's face in a cringey and unneeded way. I liked his Batman films but for me this film failed many more times than it succeeded.

Why were there 2 english planes and maybe 5 german planes in the entire battle? Why was there no build up to the arrival of the civilian flotilla? why did it it skip the actual evacuation almost entirely? Why did we have to follow a near-mute character who did absolutely nothing, and was impossible to care about? Even Tom hardy was completely uncharismatic and bored. like this battle was just another tuesday at the office. I would rather watch saving private ryan 5 times in a row than watch this ever again.

It feels like a few soldiers standing on a beach, it's so sparse and empty. There is no tension other than the that which is created by the great sound design and scoring. It also comes off as cheesy at times, like REALLY cheesy. 

None of the main characters die other than those that are clearly introduced to be cannon fodder (boy on the boat) and the fact there is no blood or gore actually strips the movie of any sense of danger or thrill. The individual stories, that eventually intersect, are really unintelligible and due to the lack of character building there is absolutely no emotional connection to them. 

I was so disappointed in this movie. If Nolan was trying to create a certain atmosphere to the movie that he thought would replace character and story it did not work. Other than the dog fight scenes it is just a sterilised PG war movie with no emotion or characters. Completely forget-able.

You keep saying that ""this movie is not about the characters"" ""of course the music doesn't stop! that's the point! it's genius!"", as you want to prove the world you are smarter than the rest of the world because you think only you can understand the ""art"" of Nolan. Let me make some points:

1- This movie is character AND plot-driven. In almost every plot-character-driven movie characterization matters. And Dunkirk is not another kind of movie. It's character and plot driven. So, why you insist characters don't matter in Dunkirk? Is because it's atmospheric war movie? That's bullshit. Several characters are introduced in this movie such as Tom Hardy or Kenneth Branagh. Tom Hardy appears at the end like an important figure, how do you keep saying that characters don't matter? Being atmospheric and focusing i¡on the battle doesn't mean characters don't matter. And btw, these characters are bullshit. They are given almost null development until the third act. So, maybe that's another contradiction. If they are not supposed to have characterization, why the movie starts to really focus on them in the third act? Your thesis make no sense.

2- Cut the shit with the music crap. You don't seem to understand what is the purpose of music in movies. It's there to point out and enhance what the visual narration is trying to convey. So, if the music NEVER SHUTS THE HELL UP it loses its purpose. Now Nolan fanboys are thinking ""But the music has a deeper, metaphorical, spiritual meaning. It's there to tell the audience we're in a war all the time."" Well, apart from being pretentious, that's not even true. The music only stops for a second in the train, but when we cut to the next scene in the train the music is playing again! So no, there's no deeper meaning. And we don't need music playing in the background all the time when they're in Dunkirk. Maybe if something dramatic is happening, like deaths or tension, you can put music. But in some  moments (like the family in the boat) where the music is annoying and unneeded. We're just witnessing a family in a boat sailing in the sea, stop the music until something major happens!

However I still think there should have been more allusion to the heroic French First Army which stayed behind to cover the evacuation. It is inaccurate that they portrayed there being no French allowed in the evacuation - many thousands of the evacuees were french.

I thought about it when i came across the character ‘tommy’. Tommy is slang for a british soldier so with this in mind, i think that there is barely any dialogue between the soldiers is because they are representing a soldier’s conscience in conflict with himself. Harry styles represents the indoctrinated part who fights for king and country and so on and is a fanatic. The french soldier represents the soldier who wants to go home not matter what be it through degrading means,meanwhile the soldier we are first introduced to is forced to choose which instincts or feelings he goes for, picture the image of an angel and a devil on your soldiers.

People like Jeremy Jahns (though I like him) don't enjoy these things as much as other people, and that's fine. Call me a Nolan fanboy, I really, really don't care. His directing/editing/soundtrack/writing style just absolutely work for me and I love every fucking minute of his movies.

It has superb atmosphere of tension. But the reason why Dunkirk was so tense was because of the score and the gritty cinematography, not the characters or plot. The score did the same for building tension as a jump-scare does for cheap thrills.
Dunkirk has very little dialogue and no characterisation which made it difficult to sympathise with the characters as they were just anonymous, unsympathetic, generic strangers rather than individual people which their own identities.

Also, I thought it was really poorly paced; I had no scope of how many people were still in Dunkirk at any one point, I didn't know how far through the evacuation they were – most of the soldiers you do see drown in sinking boats but then it very quickly moves to several soldiers on a train, and tells you that apparently over 300,000 people were safely evacuated? I had no sense of scale or pace.
Also, I didn't know how close the Germans were encroaching. The opening was good, because it showed the frontline being so close, but then it never returned to _show_ you that again. We never really saw the enemy, the hosts of aircraft, the massive fleets of ships, the German frontlines, the British and French logistics, field-hospitals, the civilians, the panicking military strategists, the British citizens worrying if they will ever see hundreds of thousands of their loved ones again, nor, most importantly of all, who these main characters were as _people_ and why we should care about _them_ while hundreds of other identical, faceless soldiers were dying around them.

Does the scarce characterisation mean the film is about just depicting the event? Well, the jolty and confusing pacing meant it struggled to do that. So maybe it's about the personal stories of the event? Well, we don't really know any of the characters, so it didn't do that either. Dunkirk was a melodramatic film which tried to evoke emotion through aesthetics and music rather than developed, relatable characters or coherent plot.",none,,2021-03-08 16:29:36.940186,1

It's tense the whole time. Yes, I understand that's by design and thats okay. My problem is that its a flatline of tension. The tension never really goes down, and never really spikes either. So when it ends to me it felt a little underwelming. There was no crescendo, it just stayed at 7/10ths tension the whole way through. I wish at some point there was some german breakthrough or something where you really had that big climatic moment but it never came. 

Sound design and cinematography was beautiful. But I don't know, I just wish there was some sort of climax somewhere in the movie rather than it being like __/----------\___ the whole movie.",none,,2021-03-08 16:29:37.415887,0

It's not a traditional war film. It's certainly not an action film. It's not even rated R. There's not a lot of dialogue in it but for this movie I think it works. It's not about a great victory, rather it's about a great loss and subsequent evacuation. The Americans weren't involved yet, it was only 1940 I think. Or 1941 (USA entered late 1941 around Christmastime). This is truly a movie that's less about what the characters have to SAY and more about what they actually DO in the moment, given the circumstances. It does kind of drag on and one of the themes I think is simply ""waiting"" in the context of being in a basically hellish situation where you could be shot at any given moment. Like waiting at a bus stop, waiting for your bus, as open and vulnerable of a shot as the enemy could ever hope to get. But at the time the Allied forces were losing, that sort of hopeless feeling is felt in the film as well. But the most important thing of all is that in spite of the odds aginst them not just in that battle but the entire war, they were determined to NEVER surrender. And in fact of course they used the legendary Churchill speech at the end which basically reaffirms all of that. This movie was phenomenal for a lot of reasons but one of the most chief among them was the fact that this era in history is rarely ever touched upon. This depicts a part of the war in which the ""good guys"" as we know them now I suppose as basically not just losing but getting their asses handed to them. This movie was about them rescuing as many as possible and getting the rest of them back on their feet to strike again... and of course we already know they won in the end. Anyways. Long comment, but the movie was great but DO REALIZE it's different before going to see it. It's really not bloody or gory at all, again it was only rated PG13, but as a film for history buffs it's a powerhouse. 9/10 IMO",none,,2021-03-08 16:29:37.416178,0

 anxiety like whats gonna happen next when is it gonna happen and how accurate that feeling must have been for all the people in dunkirk when the evacuation was taking place. we them moved on to talk about how even though there was very little charter development the acting of the fear ad looks in their faces was amazing, also how you still cried at the end with the one charter (i dont want to spoil so if you saw the movie you will understand) after that we talked about how there is no moment in this movie where there is no action. to quote me sister ""the did not pu**y di*k around with the action""and how within 30 seconds of the movie there is gunfire just made the movie so much better . two if my favorite things about this movie were: the score how even though i couldn't understand what the charters were saying at times the score could tell the story and a score, in my opinion, can make or break a movie and this score just made the movie so enjoyable. the second thing i LOVED about this movie was the directing. Nolan did so good the shots and the angles made me cry they were so good the shots when the planes were going down and when the bombs were dropped and the sinking boats and the boats filling up with water i just loved them so much there were no bad angles in this movie i loved them all. very few movies make me feel this way and very few movie get me so into historical events so much that i wanna read a book about them (i am not a fan of reading books). this movie is now one of my all time favorites i highly recomend",none,,2021-03-08 16:29:37.416488,1

I mean I saw War for the Planet of the Apes right before I went to see this one (in the same day, first time I have done that :D) and because you have seen Cceaser storyline from Rise to Dawn to War, its felt much more interesting and emotional.

And I mean I am huge ""history geek"", I love hisorical movies, but this one just didnt hit me in a way as many other historical movies have. And on top of that I have more or less liked every Nolan movie since Batman Begins, but this one I actually dont feel the need to watch again and buy on blu-ray. I just cant say what exactly Nolan should have done to make this movie better, but I just didnt feel much anything when watching it....no anxiety, no excitment, no compassion for the characters, just nothing....that was my biggest problem with Dunkirk, it had great sound design, I loved how they used real ships, real planes, instead of relying on CGI, but it was really hard to care about anything that was happening and when you couldnt really care one way or another for any of the characters.",none,,2021-03-08 16:29:37.416863,1

I think Zimmer was cleaver using in the climactic sequences Edgar's Nimrod  from his enigma variations but slowed down and just a few selected bars.
Lack of characterisation worked well imho, as my old man said the only thing he saw in the world war 2 was the living the dead and the maimed.
And to individualise characters too much would have diminished the scale that Nolan imho was trying to show.

I've got to say I'm glad you at least didn't rail against the movie for its lack of giving viewers a ""specific connection with any one character"", but I'm pretty adamant that this didn't detract from the movie at all.  To some extent I think that you may have hit on this point, but in my opinion one of the film's greatest strengths was that it didn't single out some shining star hero.  It didn't significantly expose one character over the rest, it didn't give us a handsome action hero or three and tell us that they were more important than all the other individuals suffering in the same situation.  If the film had done this, a great deal of the overarching message of humanity, the terror of the war, and the perseverance and courage of the men who took part in this event would have been lost.  The ""main characters"" don't necessarily stand out.  And they shouldn't.  I think Nolan wanted us to realize that we are more alike than we are unalike.

I see where critics like Chris are coming from, however I quite honestly didn`t like ""Dunkirk"" too much. It does in fact leave out some of the more stereotypical aspects of this genre of film, but in return some are maintained. For example: As far as I can remember the two fighter pilots of the RAF get surprised two times by enemy fighters - a good friend of mine who is a military history buff told me this was rather a case of ""keeping us at the edge of our seats"" than an accurate portrayel, which was my initial idea as well.  Also: Why was the attack of the German Fighter jets so uncoordinated? Also: Managing three kills (Tom Hardy`s Character) would have secured the character ""national hero status"" back then, it simply was not that common. These are just two examples of the movie clinging to certain stereotypes (depiction of an astouning soldier in the form of Tom Hardy`s character and unrealistic fighting scenario) - yet everyone sort of praises this movie for being a simple war movie, concentrating on the militaristic and technical aspects of it and its supposed realism. I would have loved to see a movie like that, however that movie is not ""Dunkirk"". The effects and the cinematography were of course astonishing, as well as the unconventional story telling. Yet the movie is clearly missing sth in my opinion. I have never felt this bored. Nolan should have either concentrated more on the technical aspects of the battle or let his characters show more humanity. I think that is why I personally didn`t like it - on the one hand it tries to be different than every war movie out there (supposed realism and attempt to avoid stereotypes) on the other hand it is your typical war hero. The unconventional story telling as well as the fact that there was neither anyone to root for, nor a clear objective (at first) alsomade the movie were hard to get into for the first 30-45 min.

I quite like how the story is told from several perspectives, and understand the need to have 3 separate timelines for the 3 very disparate operations, but the time frame splicing confused me as someone who didn't quite get the transitions for a good half of the movie.

I felt as though the experience of being in the war could be enhanced with a bit more ""blood and guts"" to show the true horror of battle and being shelled, and there were some finer details in the background that seemed too pristine to have been in a battlefield for me, and that detracted a bit from the experience. But, PG13 or whatnot.

Overall, intriguing film that left me feeling like I should watch it a few more times.",none,,2021-03-08 16:29:37.901173,0

Then Hitler could focus more on the eastern front. And he could easily won the war. All that would've been next to easy take care of was the United States.

As i've said earlier, Dunkirk in my opinion, is an amazing warmovie. It perfectly captures all the horror behind WW2 and the evacuation, in a realistic way. Tom, Cillian, Fionn and Mark made this movie even better aswell. Although when I went to see it in the theatre, the movie I had in mind was with more emotion, more character build-up, more dialogs, which made me feel a little bit disappointed at the end of the movie. It was a mistake going to the theatre with that image. I know that warmovies isn't really supposed to focus on emotions and dialogs, if the director wants to make it as real as possible. 

So to anybody who's going to go see it soon, don't expect an emotional movie, with you getting teared up whenever a character ends up in a bad situation. Expect a realistic warmovie, with amazing battle moments, created by the legend himself, Nolan.

Oh, and Hans Zimmer's score will give you eargasms.",none,,2021-03-08 16:29:37.901443,0

- There was not a whole lot of emotion shown from the characters faces and/or actions

But the whole experience kind of felt dull. The whole time there were just scenes of people running, walking and swimming around or standing at the shore. Then 5 percent of the movie had some action where people died from getting hit by a bomb, a few bullets or fire. Those action scenes were rarely there. And to be honest those dogfight scenes felt lazily made. I dont know... Maybe Im just hating.

Let me explain:

In this film you see the Allies pushed off the beach, barely making it out alive, and forced out of France. Then in SPR you see the Allies return four years later and take the beaches back and start to retake France. It makes things come full circle.

Unfortunately (but fortunately for the sake of history) it doesn't make you as an audience member watching these two films feel all warm and good inside because both films never make you feel ""Yay, the good guys made it out alive!"" or ""Yay, the good guys beat the bad guys."" Instead its more like ""JESUS CHRIST, THIS IS FUCKING HORRIBLE!!!"" (not the movie but the situation everyone is in).

So in theory, watching this movie and thinking ""Oh, how awful it must have been to be there..."" and then watching the Allies take the beaches of Normandy in SPR would be like catharsis, leaving you satisfied.

But it doesn't. It just makes you think ""Oh, how awful it must have been to be there...""

The movie was definitely good but I didn't feel that connected to it. I didn't care that much about any of the characters and the scenes of peril were repetitive. Mark Rylance was the only character that was interesting. It was intense(with great sound) and I was never bored but I never felt immersed or like I was there. I just felt like I was watching all these things from a distance.  I love Nolan and think he's probably the best director working right now. But this is his weakest movie in a long time. Out of his filmography Dunkirk is only better than Insomnia (which was good). But Dunkirk was a disappointment. 3 out of 5 stars.,none,,2021-03-08 16:29:38.319414,1

In a scuffle, the shell shocked soldier knocks the tea over. Answer - give him more tea. large ship rescues hundreds - given them tea. The soldiers make it back to the safety of England - more tea. US GIs were amazed that during the war, no matter what was going on, the English soldiers would stop everything for tea a couple times a day. Lastly as I read somewhere, amazing British queue etiquette.

This is a quintessentially British film, understated, concerned with the task at hand, lean, jingoistic, thrilling.  It's a great new take on capturing an historical event, but that doesn't negate the style that preceded it.  I have been in situations where I've been so stressed that I've needed to talk.  It happens.  Movies like Saving Private Ryan have down time and the characters chat about their previous lives.  It gives insight, these people were not always soldiers.  Hanks' revelation that he was just a school teacher is eye opening and powerful, as is Damon's story about his brothers.  The fact that this movie is concerned with accessing a different part of the viewers brain doesn't make those movies shite at all.  It's different.  That's good.",none,,2021-03-08 16:29:38.689125,0

My favorite Chris Nolan movies are still hands down The Dark Knight, Batman Begins and Inception. 
Then the Prestige, Dark Knight Rises, Interstellar, Insomnia and then Dunkirk. I am sure I will be the odd one out with dunkirk, on where I stand and my opinions. It's not that great to me. Just a good decent summer film. I forgot about it t- 72 hours.",none,,2021-03-08 16:29:38.689145,1

I love christopher nolan's previous films, and I loved the acting, cinematography, and action sequences. With all of that in mind, the movie was just too scattered for me to really enjoy it much. The cuts between the stories during the movie really messed up the sequence of events for me. There really is no sense of time passing, considering the fact that the main stories, while happening at the same time, had to be cut off by each other. It isn't really great as a war film at all, but it's overall an okay film in my mind. Hacksaw Ridge was a much grittier and realistic (from what i've heard) representation of the brutality of war. Dunkirk didn't really feel brutal or gritty in much of it. I know movies don't need the ""blood and guts"" flying around to be good, but it's really helps with realism in a war movie. The ending was magnificent and definitely the best part of the movie, but everything leading up to it just wasn't what I was hoping for or expecting.",none,,2021-03-08 16:29:38.689373,0

This is a visual masterpiece. Something real filmlovers will appreciate. You certainly don't need to know any of those guys to feel or root for them. Unless you have the empathy of a potato.

Also it wasn't really gritty enough, so Yea... I think it should've been more than a PG13 aswell, I don't usually like shock value gore but if you're going that route in a war movie where the only compelling thing is supposed to be how horrifying it is, at least a little blood might help a bit, and I mean, yes, it was dramatic... That's... All it was really, scene after scene, but there was nothing.... Shocking really, it felt kinda tame for something trying to depict the brutality of war. 
 Also the way things just constantly go from bad to worse kinda bored me after a while, it was like ""Hey we sorted this one thing... SURPRISE THERE'S ANOTHER PROBLEM, but ok that's dealt with- HA GOT YA HERE'S ANOTHER BAD THING! Don't worry though its- PSYCHE ANOTHER BAD THING!"" and that was just it... Until the end, which just made it for me feel kinda stale after a while.
 Yes, I get it's based on a true story,  but none of the specific stories where real anyway, so you might as well make them slightly more compelling, it doesn't need the sit down and talk about home scene but for God's sake give me something to empathise with the characters.
 I know it's a war movie and it's commemorating something that happened, but it felt too scripted and tame to be authentic and too dull to be a movie on its own without context. 
 Idk, I guess I'd prefer it with more drive... Or maybe if it focused more on one character/ group of characters without splitting it up so often, that also kinda felt too jumbled up to me to flow smoothly from the narrative standpoint,bur whatever, I seem to be in the minority, just wondering if anyone gets where I'm coming from.

We didn't know a damn thing about any of the characters in Saving private Ryan during the first 20 mins, yet that's easily the best part of that film (SPR goes downhill after that. The rest of it is nowhere near as good as the first 20 minutes). Dunkirk was like the first 20 minutes of Saving Private Ryan but the whole way through.
Did we lack empathy for the car driver in Duel just because we knew nothing about him and there is next to no dialogue? No. Did we lack empathy for Chrissie in Jaws when she's getting munched alive just because we know nothing about her?

1) It doesn't feel like a cinematic experience: Never for once in the movie do I feel like it is in a battlefield. Everything is well shot and clean which took me out of the experience. For instance, in the opening scene we see the empty town. There is no people other than the soldier, no smoke, no damaged building, just very clean buildings. You may argue that it is real, but I am watching a movie, not a documentary. If I want to know the truth I will read a book. For Cinematic reality, at least they should try. Therefore when the soldier start dying, I can only buff of smokes. This is not dying, they are falling (yes this is a PG-13 movie, but I have been PG-13 movies done better). That whole sequence is tense, yes, but it felt like a stage play. In fact,

2) No characters: Not once do I see character development, not once. there are individual moments of heroism, but without context, it is meaningless, is it there duty to safe people, are the doing it for pride. Imagine you saw Dark Knight, you see Bruce Wayne saves people as Batman but we know nothing about Bruce Wayne. How would you feel? Also I noticed at least 70% of dialogue are monologues. What I mean by that is people are explaining things rather than expressing them. For instance, when Clian Murphy's character showed up, the old man said ""he is not the same man"". We already know that, Murphy is a great actor and he is very convincing. So why have that line? It is for the audiences? In fact, there are more than one occasion where I hear lines like that and frankly I was insulted. Also, the kid who died in the boat... good lord....

3) Storytelling: Before you say anything. Yes, I understand why Nolan did it and yes, I wasn't confused, but I HATED IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Why because it was unnecessary and painfully pretentious. Let me explain: there are three arcs and each have different time span, so telling them at the same time means there will be time shifts. Why is that a problem? Because a) it will ruin the suspense for other arcs, for instance, in the air arc, we have overhead shots with soldiers jumping into the sea from the boat they are about to ride on. But in the mole arc, the story didn't happen yet, so we already knew the results of the events. b) it creates more distraction than needed, first time I was annoyed by the radical shift of day and night, second time I was still annoyed because I don't understand they have to do it. Imagine you write a thesis, imagine you have three points and imagine before finishing you point, you start another, and then move on to the third point, and then back to the first one. How would your professor feel? You may say ""o so you don't like non-linear storytelling?"" I like it when it works? Momento works because there is a clear pattern despite it seemingly random time jump and it is fitting because our main character's condition is perfect for the story. Tarantino films worked because there is a rhythem to his non-linear stories, like reading a novel. There is a climax and there is a moment of truth, and even when he is telling you non-linear story each arc is told with a focus. In Dunkirk, it is a luster-fuck. At the end of the film, they try to tell you the three comes together, but it felt so forced, like in your face. 

I can go on. If you want to see more just see Youtube video I made. If I don't like something, I will not complain without giving concrete reasoning because it won't be fair for the people who put efforts in the film. I know why people liked it (just like all other Nolan films), but I am sorry: to say this film is overrated is an understatement on my book, I hated it. People will tell me everyone loved it, people will say that vets loved it. I respect them and I respect their opinion, but that doesn't mean I have to like it where obviously I don't!!!",none,,2021-03-08 16:29:38.690217,0

The sound was tuned so that we could feel every gunshot, every bomb dropped. Nolan made us feel this movie, not just watch. I was tensed up for the whole duration.
   I really do hope the rumours about him potentially directing Bond 25 are true, he could easily rival Skyfall. And even something like Akira I'm interested to see how he'd do it like Spielberg with Ready Player One.

point.  The actual events of Dunkirk may have come as a revelation to many, given the small role
of history in US schools' curriculum.  (An amazing number of college students couldn't identify
who won the Civil War).  It's no wonder so many are stunned by the film's narrative of one of the
great miracles of WWII which didn't involve Americans.  The aerial sequences best captured the
reality of dog-fighting.  Unfortunate there was no restored Stuka available, so CG representations

And the film does a pretty good job at that, it is a masterpiece when it comes to the style, and the authenticity etc.

But there is one thing that annoys me a little bit, just a bit: As this movie is purely about the event, it in my opinion struggles or failes to portray one aspect correctly. The movie makes it seem like pretty much every boat and ship of the Royal Navy gets sunk and that they are completely failing to achieve their objective, rescue those 320.000 men. The movie rather lets it look like all the civilian boats saved the day, getting all these men away from the beaches. And don´t get me wrong, all these brave civilians made their inspired and inspiring contribution to the effort, however, alltogether they were only responsible for roughly 25% of the men rescued. 
In fact, it was the Navy that planned and directed the evacuation from Dunkirk and of this strange operation the destroyers, tired already from the Norwegian campaign, were the tireless heroines.

Some numbers of men rescued:

5,031 in 203 private Motor boats
4,895 in 27 yachts (some of them manned by the Navy)
28,709 in 230 trawlers and drifters
48,472 in 38 Minesweepers 
87,910 in 45 personnel vessels (manned by the Royal and the Merchant Navy)
102,843 in 56 destroyers and torpedo boats

And as Dunkirk is really just about the event, I think this was a bit left out of the movie. It still is an amazing an great movie, I just wished this would have been a little bit more included :)",none,,2021-03-08 16:29:39.132274,0

~though I doubt anyone will read this~

I saw this movie a couple days ago and I am still shocked at how much I loved it. I usually go for sci-fi films like Star Wars and this was quite different. This movie has very little dialogue but I think that is what makes it all the more impressive and impactful on the mind. When German planes were headed toward Dunkirk we didn't need to be told. No one had to yell out, ""Get Down!"". We could tell what was happening by the looks on the actors faces and the quick shuffles into cover. I would assume that in a real war it would be the exact same.

There were a couple scenes I found very troubling. Starting with Cillian Murphy's character. I love how they brought him into it. He is a great actor and portrayed the role very well. When his character accidentally killed Barry Keoghan's character it was extremely sad to me. Especially how they tried to lie to him about it. It only made his PTSD worse. You could figure all of this out with barely any words. Truly great storytelling.

The other part that really made me think about how realistic it is was the part where Harry Styles' character was trying to kick Aneurin Barnard's character off of the boat so it would not sink. Aneurin's character was there pretty much from the beginning and you sort of ended up judging him by his actions. You knew he really wasn't a bad guy. He just wanted out. But Harry's character pointed out how he hadn't spoke at all and that he might be a spy. It turned out he was French and they were on the same side. But Harry's character did not care at all. He was not British so his life did not matter. This is all too real and I find it very upsetting.

There were many other parts of this film that I have opinions on but my fingers are cramping from typing so much. I feel like I kind of pointed out the obvious on some parts but maybe it was just obvious to me. Some of the things I thought might be stupid and childish but that's just because I'm a child.",none,,2021-03-08 16:29:39.552977,0

Some of the scenes were pretty ridiculous for a film that was trying to be realistic, like when Tom Hardy's character somehow managed to shoot down a diving Stuka after his fighter's reserve fuel ran out. The constant pro-British sentimentality towards the end became a bit annoying as well. If an American filmmaker portrayed American troops/civilians in a similar manner to the way Nolan portrayed British troops/civilians in this film, he would undoubtedly be called out as biased and historically inaccurate.

Overall, I'd say Dunkirk is an average film. It had some great moments, but its flaws were definitely noticeable.",none,,2021-03-08 16:29:39.553211,0

It's not as if there were necessarily any notable people or groups of people that actually did anything here, it was more the event rather than any individual person that made it what it was.

Anyway, he is definitely not an emotional person at all, so that really solidified the emotional impact this film can have on a person).

It is a movie about cowards.
I cannot believe the shallow, abysmal writing. I am in shock that someone spent 100 million dollars to make this lukewarm piece of garbage. Nolan was apparently terrified to show any nationalism at all and went to incredible lengths to downplay the moral implications between the Allies and the Axis ie good versus evil.  That is the reason that he jumped immediately into the battle, it saved him from defining who was right and who was wicked. I have looked forward to a movie about Dunkirk since I learned about the story but this is not the telling of those people and their brave actions,  this is an attempt, imho, to rewrite history. Perhaps Nolan included the overall elements to include the over 300,000 men and the destroyers sunk etc. but the true heart of the story was completely lost and replaced with an ugly, sideways telling of the event.",none,,2021-03-08 16:29:40.005167,1

*In 2017, over 330.000 film viewers were stuck in a cinema, surrounded by boredom, can they be rescued?*

It's hard to understand critic ratings of 10/10 while this movie undeniably lacks quality on some very important aspects. Let me start off with some positive notes:
- IMAX: The impact of the bullets and bombs felt as if you were really there. The entire movie is shot in a very realistic way. 
- Opening scene: The suspense, music and cinematography all came together very well in the opening scene, which really made me excited for the scenes to come.
- Acting: Poor acting can easily distract the audience from their experience of being in a certain time/place. But there was not a single moment in which an actor did something out of character. All expressions were very believable. Great acting!
But there were some major aspects I had issues with:
- Characters: The characters did not have any background story and there's hardly any dialogue to give some insight. The main characters are therefore replaceable for any other random soldier on that beach. I do not expect an elaborate introduction of every character, certainly not in a historical war movie, but the downside is that the audience cannot empathize with the main characters. I really didn't care for one of them to die. I've seen hundreds of soldiers die in earlier scenes of the movie, why would one or two more (just as hollow and unknown as any other soldier) bother me a bit? It's no must to focus on character development, as long as the other aspects of the movie make up for the lack of it. In Dunkirk that sadly was not the case.
- Editing: Sometimes it was hard to follow which moment in time is shown, because the movie abruptly cuts between three perspectives, therefore even showing some events twice. I find this non-linear storytelling and continuity breaks unnecessary and poorly executed.
- Repetitive: Much scenes are identical or slightly different from another. Especially the flight scenes did not add much to the story. Instead I rather would've seen some scenes at the front-line with troops actually defending the beach instead of just a bunch of scared, helpless troops waiting for the next plane to fly over and bomb the shite out of them. Keeping out the Germans at the front-line is just as much a part of the story of Dunkirk and it would've given us a chance to actually see the enemy and get some awesome battle scenes. 
- Music: Usually I enjoy Zimmer's score. But in this movie there was no moment of silence, not a moment to break the suspense. Especially in IMAX, my ears were buzzing hours after I left the cinema. Was this intentional? Was it supposed to feel like one big action scene without any breaks, to get the same feeling of those soldiers, trapped between battles unable to take a break, constantly in stress of a nearing attack? Well, than Nolan did succeed. But I found it very annoying. 
Overall I believe this movie is highly overrated, due to many biased Nolan fans and critics blindly hopping on the hype-train. I found it a very boring movie. The lack of an interesting plot or any interesting characters sadly wasn't compensated enough by the impressive audiovisuals. Rescue yourself from boredom and don't watch this movie!

No one speaks, they stand around hoping they make it home. I could speak a bunch about it, but I will say that the characters were great. It was all acting. Very little dialogue. Harry did a great job and Tom hardy's pilot was one of my favourites. The decisions he made in the air, to turn around etc. was very emotional. He did a great job.

I know someone will say ""It's not about one character but 400,000 trying to survive"" But I couldnt give a shit if they got off or not? No one to root for. The pacing was weird and got annoying an hour into it, that annoying ticking sound throughout got on my nerves. All the tension built up to nothing? Just german bomer after german bomber, all the soldiers duck, some explosions, repeat. You dont actually see anyone die on screen? apart from that annoying 17 year old who got knocked out and died? what was the point in his character??haha. No story or character arcs.. I didnt learn anything. I thought at least one character could of been killed off to make it more emotional? But no.. they all lived. Why did Nolan need such great actors for characters with barely any dialogue? What was cillian murphys role.. wtf??All he done was shake in a blanket and killed a boy for no reason? That spitfire pilot who was knocking on the glass to break out from drowning... all that tension and build up for nothing!?? You knew he was going to get it out because Mark Rylance spotted him? So no tension or stakes for me. Everyone saying 'Styles was so goo in it' You barely saw him ffs? Tom hardy had a nice sacrifice, but he lived, I didnt care about him.  I am sorry but this film is just spectacle, this FILM HAD LESS CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT THAN TRANSFORMERS!!!  It should be you care about the characters, then care about the situation they're in.. not the other way round. People saying 'the situation was the main character' BULSHIT! I dont care about the situation if i have no one to root for. This was more of a documentary than a FILM!!!  - Sound good, props good, sets good, acting good I guess?

Christopher Nolan’s Dunkirk is really another run of Batman
and Inception’s, all excitement but lacking all historical accuracies.  Throughout the film, you can hear the ticking
of a watch’s seconds in the background noise, as to magnify the suspense and race
for time to save lives.  This is a
characteristics of Chris Nolan, building similar timeline suspense, as
previously found in the ‘The Dark Knight’, and ‘Inception’.  Special effects were kept to a minimum, which
is a good thing, for most movies about WW2 are now heavily digitalized, for it
is nearly impossible to bring back WW2 planes, ships, and related weapons for Hollywood
movies.  There is silly moment like when
a civilian boat captain spoke of ‘the sweet sound of the Spitfire’s Rolls Royce
Merlin engine’.  During the war, the
British would never disclose secrets of their fighter planes, let alone a
civilian boat captain would know about the detailing facts of the Spitfire.  The film also stirred up the patriotic charisma
and sacrifice of the English people during the disheartening retreat, but it is
too poetic when a Royal Navy Commander, cast by Kenneth Branagh, spoke
eloquently that “you all can leave, but I’ll stay for the French”.  Well, romantic it is, but that did not
happen.  Other ultimate sacrifice, like
of the family casual accepted loss of a young son due to the cowardice act of a
shell-shock British soldier, is seem way too artificial, to be choked up in
emotion.

Tom Hardy as the fighter pilot of the Spitfire is truly
inspiring and humble.  But again,
accuracies and facts fall really short when his plane flew for hours, shooting
down 2 Heinkel 111, and 3 ME109s. 
Throughout the film, his Spitfire blazes its machine gun, with endless
ammunition, when it is fact that a typical 1940 Spitfire can carry only enough
ammunition for less than 20-second continuous burst.  Dear God!!! 
Tom was able to shoot down a Stuka even when his Spitfire ran out of
fuel – WTF!

Nevertheless, the film has good actors, and the drama was
good.  Surprisingly, Harry Styles, the
teen heart throb, played his debut role in this film very well, casting as a
loud-mouth thug.  One would expect that
he would play a role of a pretty boy instead.

Overall, Dunkirk is a good, fictional war drama, based on
true events – a tall tale telling of Britain’s greatest struggle during the
darkest hour.  The film is well played
with faceless enemies, as the German is not portrayed in this movie, with minor
exception of flying ME109s, Heinkels, and blurry silhouettes of Werhmacht
soldiers.  Nolan did a fine job to make
England feel good all over again, and a fine work he did, for that country is
now having to deal with new face of evil in terrorism and radical
Jihadist.  Perhaps Nolan’s ‘Dunkirk’ is
the booster dose that Britain is now in need of.",none,,2021-03-08 16:29:40.402765,0

Nolan had a star-studded cast, but no one overshadowed the other, because the soldiers, and the civilians that helped them, all played an equally important part- they were all heroes- the nation came together as one.  Even the lack of dialogue, I thought, was a brilliant experiment that translated very well into the seriousness of the event. There was a theme of eerie quiet throughout the film which kept the audience (or me at least) always a bit nervous. This was  punctuated by the music which built up slowly, and then abruptly stopped a couple times throughout the film, to sheer dead silence. I can't think of another recent film, in which the music was so important- almost playing the part of the dialogue/ narration of the film. To me, and I'm just an average joe here (definitely not a film critic), I thought this was a brilliant film.

Because there is so little dialogue, and because the characters we chiefly follows seldomn profess or develop in any way, it was hard to examine the psyhcological impact of any of the characters. Because the movies structure predominantly followed the characters put simply having escape routes fucked over and going from the next to the next method of escape, until they escape. 

This is all the more disappointing because much of the dialogue in Dunkirk was tremendous to say the least, it was the dialogue which in part conveyed the theme and realism of the horrors of war as Chris scrutinized, while coupling it with a compelling narrative. Unfortunately there was just so little of it. 

My favorite seen in the movie is when the first main character we are introduced two, and the two main people he attempts to escape with, are in a boat with others when gunshots sparringly begin to go through it, due to target practice from Germans I presume. As the boat begins to flood the characters realize the weight on the boat is the predominant issue, and as they begin to turn on each other to facilitatet their own escape, this is where I feel the movies predominant message culminated and both manifested far more than in any other scene. Which is disappointing only because most of the other scenes were far more akin to an action movie, I did find them, dull.",none,,2021-03-08 16:29:40.825978,0

Maybe the worst of any war films. The reasons are simple. 1. The beach looked liked something  out of the Normandy landing in reality. 2. The film shows none of the actual ground fighting that makes this battle memorable besides the number of evacuated and the private boats that helped. This rescue was only possible because of the small amount of men (about 40,000 mainly french and some english) holding back a lot of nazis (7 infantry divisions and 3 armor divisions).  The men that stalled the Nazis made the evacuation possible along with the private boats and historians have compared those 40,000 to the greeks at Thermopylae. The movie was a joke on so many levels. No character development, inaccurate history, three incredibly boring subplots. This movie could of been amazing, because in real life it was.

Maybe I'm desensitized, but I wasn't horrified like I think I should've been, as much as I wanted to get into it. The four or five dogfights, for instance, all played out pretty much the same way, and the British pilots never seemed to be truly fearful or as if they were in much danger, especially Tom Hardy's character. I seemed like it was pulling its punches because of a PG-13 rating, and that was lame. Or maybe I was just sleepy and haven't ever had to experience anything even close to that nature, so it isn't connected to my reality.

I think the realism of the movie is certainly to be commended. The desperation of the men  is very clear, and I imagine soldiers would be reserved and wary when they are in a warzone. That said, I have to agree with Chris; it was really hard to sympathize with the characters. I thought maybe it was just me but my friends felt the same way. At first, I viewed this as a major drawback. 

However, perhaps Nolan was trying to draw a larger point about the plight of a soldier in real life. Unless we know someone personally, each soldier is really just another number, another statistic. We don't really care about them unless they do something significantly heroic. In this movie, the soldiers-- who we were sparsely acquainted with-- barely survived, and this was supposedly an impressive feat (demonstrated by the exchange between Harry Styles character and the blanket guy at the end of the film). Therefore, Nolan is saying that soldiers shouldn't need to be outgoing or especially heroic to garner our appreciation. Simply signing up to risk their lives exceeds sufficience.*


*Obviously, this is only true for justified war. I'm sure there are many examples of Dunkirk-like situations in world history, but this may be why Nolan chose World War II as an example, because virtually everyone can sympathize with fighting against Nazis.",none,,2021-03-08 16:29:40.826199,0

It really puts you in the moment, and it does a great job of showing the horrors of war while still staying somewhat optimistic (unlike most war movies). I think the ending really demonstrates this. We get the whole Churchill speech about sacrifice, and then we see the face of a soldier who has sacrificed. It does an incredible job of showing just what ""sacrifice"" actually entails, *without undercutting Churchill's point about the necessity of sacrifice*. In this way the movie both shows just how much these soldiers went through, and yet also says just how important the values they fought for truly were. It makes a mountain of their sacrifice, and deservedly so, but then puts the mountain up against the importance of defending freedom and home and shows that the sacrifice is always worth it. I would say my only complaint is that the movie gets somewhat repetitive, and despite putting our characters in great danger, they rarely actually die. This sort of takes away from the fear factor by the end, because it feels like the characters have a plot armor that they didn't have earlier in the film. Still, Dunkirk is a classic and skyrockets to upper tier of Nolan movies.",none,,2021-03-08 16:29:40.826583,0

Nolan has been dumping generic conventions and cliches in pretty much all his films, most of the time with phenomenal success. However with Dunkirk, Nolan has taken one of the most cliched and generic genre and stripped it from all its trappings to give a simple, yet compelling film. Some who have called this film cold and unengaging should patiently watch this film again, because IMHO Dunkirk is far more heartbreaking and tragic than pretty much any other war film I've ever seen. Nolan's direction, Zimmer's score and the editing and cinematography are some of the best I have ever experienced.

We know nothing about Fion's character, so if the film IS about WAR, then why does it focus so much emphasis around him, yet not building his character in anyway.

One of Nolan's best and differential. Still processing the experience.Those complaining about no character development have observational skills equivalent to a child. 

The characters reactions and decisions gives you plenty and rewards you the more you observe. You learn more about them as you watch. I  got the full benefit knowing WWII and Dunkirk but, Nolan doesn't treat those who don't like idiots. No cleshay 5 minute relaxing moment of: ""This is why i joined, etc"" or ""When i get to the pub/girl..."".  It's very accurate historically, gave great homage to the french defenders, & really brought you in with tiny details. Sound effects were extremely realists/frightening and Hans Zimmer delivers an intense soundtrack molded with the movie's pace.

One of the best scenes in the film is supported so well by Hans Zimmer's score, it is a challenge to imagine the scene without it. The characters aren't played by name actors, but the characters just want off the beach. They find a wounded solder, and haul him on the stetcher for what seems like a mile, get through other people, walk on loose boards...and the medical ship could leave at any minute.

I felt attached to them. This isn't a one time thing even in Rogue One Chris doesn't seem to care about the character. I think Chris is so analytical that if a movie doesn't meet a certain criteria then it didn't do whatever he was looking for properly. SPOILER: The fact that the RAF pilot literally kept fighting even though he had less than 10 gallons of fuel, shot down 4 more German planes, AND was captured wasn't enough to make you see what type of character he was?

The fact that the commander decided to stay with the French to help fight and ultimately knowing he's going to die (or get captured) doesn't make you feel anything?

I totally agree that this very much about war and being in the moment even if I would've preferred some more characterization or heart, but I feel like there were a few moments where Nolan wanted the audience to feel something in the resolving bits, which I didn't feel. Like when the boats finally came in to save everyone and you see Keneth Branagh's little relieved smile - this was the ""rah rah, the saviors have come, shed a tear for their salvation and that people are sacrificing themselves to save the soldiers"" but I didn't feel it. And I think that if there were more scenes seeing people breaking down more emotionally (doesn't need to be backstory) throughout as they try to escape but fail, then this relief that ""finally they're going to be rescued"" would've payed off more. 

For example, show Kenneth Branagh's character starting out confident and slowly getting more frustrated as lifeboats keep returning to the beach.  Have that main young guy have a moment or two of hopelessness before he rallies himself for his next try at escaping - even just give more desperation in his and his french friend's acting as they try to escape. They were deadpanned most of the time (and yes i understand the shellshocked aspect which I thought was great) but what about a little more panic - a silent shot of one of them sitting alone thinking, tearing up psyching themselves out more.

With the civilian boats coming to help, I get that we're just focused on the one but maybe seeing more of them coming could help tensions too. We only saw the group at the very end though time-wise they would've been out there not too far off from our focus boat.  Seeing them coming and also failing or being bombed could've added that tension as to how many would make it? would they make it in time? etc.

Nolan wanted to show the reality of war and be in the moment and he did great to shoot it beautifully and have some white-knuckle scenes but he also put moments in where he clearly wanted us to care more, and I'm sorry to say I didn't feel anything.",none,,2021-03-08 16:29:41.194102,0

It´s about every single person back then not about some special few in the spotlight and the others dying are just the backdrop for their arc´s.

Good acting and directing does not require dialogue to be meaningful and as this was a time capsule of the dreadful few hours between the gathering of the soldiers upon the shore to surviving the German onslaught to being rescued by the heroic civilian volunteers, the only thing threw me was the day night cycle and how Nolan plays with time.

You are so right, the people involved would not have been chatting about who they have at home.  Why would they. I think if anyone had stated on about their families at home they would have been told to shut up.  Just want to stay alive and get out.

This is one of the most historic, important, and life changing events in human history.This story and event brings tears to my eyes because it truley is remarkable
      Dunkirk is a technical and visual masterpiece! Christopher Nolan delivers get again a stunning, beautiful, and groundbreaking spectacle that captivates and entuces you into this heartpounding world. This is one of the most gorgeous films ever made HANDS DOWN! And this will most certainly be used in future filmaking classes as a staple and classic in filmaking. The way the film is handled first of all is so raw and realistic! The film is shakey and mean, which provides the audience with a captivating and incredibly believable and lively perspective on the film, making them feel like they are in the horrific situation with the characters. The camera work is exceptionally vivid, clear, and wide making it easy to spot and distinct everything that is out on screen, such as the characters, action, shios, boats, planes, etc. There was not one moment in the film where I found it difficult to pinpoint details, even in the raw and chaotic sequences. There are a lot of beautiful, gorgeous, mind blowing, and powerful wide shots that are used in this, primarily because 70 + percent of the film was shot in Imax cameras. The wide range shots are some of the best I have ever seen..PERIOD! From the beaches, the cities, the ships, boats, sea, everything is shown so grand and beautiful, which really compliments and presents the incredible cinematography and spectacle this movie truley is. This movie is also 100 percent realistic. Real people, real planes, real boats, real ships, and real sea and ocean. In fact this movie was actually FILMED IN DUNKIRK! It all looks so amazing, and movies should take note of Christopher Nolans work here. However, to me where the camera work really shines and revolutionizes filmakimg today are the close quarter shots. Oh my God I have never been so allured, captured, invested, blown away, and grateful for camera work such as this! These close quarter shots grab, pull, and lure you into these scenes! My lord it was ju s incredible and I have never experienced anything like it before! Every time they paned into a character (s), boats, planes, ships, underwater, explosions etc, it was soooooo whiteknuckling and intense! It was done so old school but fresh and modern at the same time! I have no words to describe how brutal and intense it was when it was close quarters I really don't! You feel like you are struggling for survival with them and you yourself feel like you are in parell. Scenes and shots like these make you feel fear, anxiety, pain frustration, nervousness and hoplessness, and that just about sums up Dunkirk. When men are jumping into the water and swimming for their lives, bombs are dropping in every corner, ships are sinking, planes are up in the air fighting for their lives, people that are inside of a ship have no way out and are struggling to escape.....you feel like you are there with them every step of the way. This tells you how much of a technical triumph Dunkirk is, and it is all practical. This proves why practical effects, if done right, will always give you the best experience you will ever get, and this is one of it not the best technical film ever made.

   CONGRADULATIONS TO THE CAST OF DUNKIRK! WHAT AN AMAZING CAST! This is beautiful just beautiful! Thank you to every single one of these people involved in this incredible and beautiful project! Every single one of these incredibly talented people bonded together to give us sonething unlike anything we have ever seen before, and Iam not forgetting about the two amazing actors that are Tom Hardy and Cillian Murphy who did an incredible job on this film! Ladies and Gentleman the incredible and heartpounding Dunkirk is one of the best experiences you will ever have! Words like thrilling, heartpounding, intense, emotional, suspensful and much more!
     This film is chaotic, white knuckling, exciting, incredible, mezmerizing, and beautiful are in my vocabulary! This is one of the best war films ever made, one of the best movies in years! Hell this might even be my favorite war film ever, or the best! I have to think about that for a while, but there is no doubt this is one of the best war films ever, and the best cinematic experience you have ever had, or ever will have. This a once in a lifetime experience, and it is something unlike anything you have ever seen before! Dunkirk is not just a film, but an event every movie lover, or person in general, needs to watch! Dunkirk is one of the best films in a long time. It is a triumph in every way possible! I LOVED DUNKIRK BEYOND BELIEF! This is my favorite film of the year and one of my favorite films of all time! It gave me the best movie and cinematic experience I ever had, and I will never forget watching this incredible film in Imax! Dunkirk is absolutely incredible, mesmerizing, beautiful, gorgeous, thrilling, dramatic, chaotic, powerful, unique, tense, grand, emotional and breathtaking! I hate it when you look foward to a film so much, you watch it, you love it and than it is gone. You can always watch it again, and I will certainly do so, but that first time is classic original, and treasurable. This is my most memorable movie experience ever. DUNKIRK WILL ALWAYS HOLD A PLACE IN MY HEART! THIS FILM BROUGHT ME INTO TEARS! I will never forget Dunkirk and the once in a lifetime experience I had watching this film. This is a masterpiece in my book. Christopher Nolan you did it again you Legend. One of the greatest filmakers in history, and the best filmakers around. And everyone do youselves a favor and WATCH THIS FIL. IN IMAX! IT IS WORTH IT TRUST ME! This movie is made for Imax, and you quickly realize this when you watch the movie. Iam telling you, if you want the best experience you have ever had, and want to watch Dunkirk, watch it in Imax, and be prepared to be bloooown out of the water! You will never forget it. I certainlly will not. Thank you all for giving us this beautiful art. This is the biggest movie event of the year everyone! HANDS DOWN THE BEST MOTION PICTURE OF THE YEAR!

Let's face it, character development is an important element in film, but despite what you may think, it's not always the most crucial element of a movie, now yes, for some movies it is, take for example, The Hateful Eight, that is a movie that is built as dialogue and character driven, thus it's more of a priority to have character development, otherwise the main driving force of the movie fails, thus the movie as a whole fails, but for a movie like this, where it's about the event and not the characters, it's not needed, unlike other war movies like Saving Private Ryan or Hacksaw Ridge where the whole movie is the story of a specific person, in those types of war movies character is needed, but in a movie about an event, not a person, it's not, it's like saying you went into Pacific Rim wanting big, in depth character development, how much of a load does that sound? And if they did try to put character development scenes in there they'd probably be seen as tacked on and unnecessary, you don't need to have them sit around a campfire and talk about how they have to win this war and get back to their pregnant wife or something like that, let's face it, even though professional critics may have taught you otherwise, character development isn't always the biggest priority of a movie, the plot that it promised you is the most important part of a movie, otherwise you feel like you got ripped off, if every movie was about developing characters for the whole movie, than every movie might as well be called 'Characters Of [Insert Movie Here]'",none,,2021-03-08 16:29:42.022676,0

In my review one of the flaws of the film was not feeling that connection to the characters. Look, Im not saying they needed to dive into backstory, or flashbacks, or exposition dialogue... I just wanted to know something about the characters we were following. I know Nolan was going for the confusion and just flat out mayhem of this war and event, and he succeeded with that tremendously. Its a brilliant directorial achievement. Just in terms of some of the storytelling choices, and lack of knowing much about the characters you want to be invested in, I thought it could of been better. That is just my personal preference though and wanted some of the incredible action sequences to connect with the audience more. I love how Nolan made a unique war film and the film he wanted to make so I totally respect the views of the people who loved this approach. Good film and Nolan is one of my favorite directors and I am still thinking about the film so that says something! Awesome review Chris, look forward to even more of your videos man.

The first time I watched it in a regular theatre, I left confused, thinking it was the worst Christopher Nolan movie ever. I had no idea what Dunkirk in history was about, I did not understand why the timeline keeps switching and I had trouble catching up with the different characters. 

Second time, I watched it in IMAX. I have to say, spend the money, find an IMAX screening near you. Other than a more immersive experience, I understood the movie completely and I have to say, it is a masterpiece. There are little things that you can only spot once you watch it a second time, like any other Nolan movies/tv series. These little moments of brilliance blow my mind like any other Nolan movie, and I was not expected to be mindblown in Dunkirk, it being a historical film.

My point is, give it a second chance and watch it again if you felt confused. Also, do not expect to get any emotional feelings from this movie. It is about realism and experiencing the events like you are really there. The movie is different from mainstream Hollywood, but it is also brilliant.",none,,2021-03-08 16:29:42.024203,0

Christopher Nolan threads the needle so well, each character becomes a harmony to the evacuation medley. You can feel the same resolve that inspired 11 American pilots to fly for the RAF during the Battle of Britain and the same pessimism that came as a prelude to the French surrender two weeks later.

It is completely useless, and has nothing to do with being melodic,
I'll explain:
 - The function of a soundtrack score is either a narrative one, a subtextual or a emotional one. but said he didn´t wanted emotion on the score, but ironically the only thing from these 3 purposes that is working, is emotion (kinda of...): The ticking clocks, the emotion/feeling of the characters that they are running out of Time;
 - The drones and airplanes' sound have no narrative or subtextual use, which is a shame because with no emotion you''d go perhaps that way;
 - If you want Non-Diegetic sounds instead of music, don´t hire a real music composer, hire a sound designer;
 - Ironically for the director wanting a non emotional soundtrack, they put an extremely emotional music piece at the end, as a species of cathartic ending to all that suspense.... '''Unfortunately'' was not composed by Hans Zimmer. Don't take me wrong the piece makes perfect sense in context of these historic events, but if Zimmer wrote The Lion King, which had so similar tracks to this one piece of music.

Is exposition really needed for character development? I really don't think so, sometimes cheesy dialogue is the easy overused way for movies to force a connection between the viewer and the characters. While it may be harder to achieve character development in such a tense, non stop action film I don't think it's impossible to, as everyone reacts to pain, challenges, and the possibility of death in different ways and not always with words. There's a lot that can be conveyed through body language, facial expressions and simple, realistic dialogue. A character driven film was probably not Nolan's intention but I do think that viewers ultimately not connecting or caring about the characters is still a legitimate criticism.

It's less about each individual's story and more about the concept of survival and expressing the horror of what they're going through by the spectacle. The first time I watched AOT, I thought it was just way too dark, I knew literally nothing of it before I started watching it, I had thought it was just some typical Shoen series from how popular it got, I still don't understand why it's SO popular in the mainstream anime media when it is really as dark as it is, and watching it I was like, why am I watching this? It's just too much, but being optimistic, I kept watching because I wanted to see if the characters were going to survive these brutal series of events, and before I knew it, that was the end of season 1. There's a lot of movies and anime series that you watch and think ""aww it'd be so cool to be in that world"" but with AOT, and the same with this film, it's not at all like that, it's gritty and real and ugly and you aren't questioning too much of what's going on because you are just so caught up with these characters in survival mode that you stop thinking critically too, you just want them to survive. It's not easy for me to watch media like that because it's just too heavy, and if I could have a choice I'd rather NOT get emotionally involved in something that I know will be beyond horrific, but when I DO end up caught up in a story like that, I'm definitely fully invested. I don't like that I am, but I am because there's a very real human connection I have to seeing my fellow man suffer like that and imagining what it would be like, I just want to hold out for when it's over.",none,,2021-03-08 16:29:43.785993,0

Its a war film about war, and trying to get as close to showing people what it was like to be in this battle from different perspectives. I think the only thing it could have used was more blood to show the graphic and horrific side of war, but a lot of movies have done that before and it wasn't totally necessary to convey the message Nolan was trying to get across. War is scary. Young people die. And most will die alone, far from home, in a situation they dont fully understand and fighting for something they may not understand either. If you like authentic war films, and movies that really try to portray an accurate look of the situation on the ground of these conflicts, you should do yourself a favor and watch.

The reason you have for this is that you believe this movie is all about the moment and the event, but I don't see how this isn't the case with Rogue One also, as it's all about the event of stealing the Death Star plans.

Maybe not up close and personal, but she and her friends watched the boats go out - most came back but some didn't.

You didn't feel very connected to the characters by the end of the film, which I understand because I did not feel it that much either.  However, the reason I didn't mind that so much is because I knew that story was about the grander purpose being served.  It was to give us insight into the rebellion and what it was like to be in that struggle, which was the main draw for me, very similar to what you're saying here about this film.  I felt Rogue One was more about the situation than the characters.

They were essentially not attacked, relative to what GER could have easily done.  Most people say it was because Hitler screwed up, and pulled all his forces back.

Recently it has been revealed Hitler offered peace to Churchill NUMEROUS times.  GER would withdraw to pre WWI boundaries.  Many believe Dunkirk was his way of extending an olive branch to Churchill, by letting so many live.

For whatever reason, almost all forces pulled back or told not to advance",none,,2021-03-08 16:29:45.272482,0

I love only two of his movies (inception and dark knight).
The others are waving between ok (ex: begins, insomnia...) to MEH-ish (Interstellar, memento,...)
He is a good script writer, but an ok director. He films everything the way it's supposed to (shot-countershot in conversation, very close shot for important objects, wide shot to introduce scenes, etc.)
Some may says he plays a lot with a fracture narration, and so with editing. But really, this is also the way he writes that forces this editing work; and his quest of playing with the truth of what we see. Once you understand how he writes/directs, you can predict where he is leading you; that's what happened for me in Interstellar; too predictable (ps: that's not the only reason i don't like this movie.)
And sometimes, when he plays to much with editing, the story make no real sense at the end (watch memento in the real order, there are so many problems).
I have no hype at all for Dunkirk, but will surely see it; and i don't want to offend those who adore him, just posting my opinion on the guy.",none,,2021-03-08 16:29:45.272555,0

Hell, even Jeremy's review made me more excited to see it. I think that the lack of characterization and arcs will benefit the film more. In an industry where war films are merely drama-filled character pieces (not that there is anything wrong with that) set in the backdrop of a historical war, Dunkirk portrays it all as a real event in a real war with real people. In real war any no-name soldier can do anything at anytime. There are no stars or standouts amongst the infantry. Everyone does their job and they try to stay alive and fight for as long as possible. Only when they get home are their deeds and heroics made public and then they become big names. 

Just because a soldier in this film is played by a big name actor does not mean the writers have to create this massive story arc for them. Same goes for civilians in this. Mark Rylance is a great actor but he is meant to be just an average civilian who stands up to do his duty for his country. Like Chris said, it is about the real event told in a realistic way. I'm sure, almost positive that soldiers during WWII swapped stories about home and whose waiting for them on a regular basis. This is not that kind of story though. This is about the evacuation of 400,000 men who are totally surrounded by Nazi forces, told through the eyes of a couple soldiers just doing their job and trying to stay alive, again, just like the rest of those stranded on the beach. With the stakes so high and the clock constantly ticking, I'm sure there was barely anytime to take a breather and reminisce about your past or future with a bunch of other colorful characters when your so focused on surviving the moment. 

It is that kind of film where little character focus and development can be considered fresh and new. I can't wait to see it opening night!",none,,2021-03-08 16:29:45.274172,0

He gave it his 2nd highest grade (A) and basically praised it all the way through. Also understand, that this is just *my* opinion on the film and yes, I *have* seen it.

However, I have to say that I don't really understand Chris' one big ""criticism/flaw"" with this movie...the lack of character development. Huh?

First of all, I completely disagree as we learn just enough about the characters that we need to in order to feel empathy for them. Second, and much more to my point, Chris kind of undercuts and negates his own argument about the lack of development when he kept mentioning the stuff about, ""Well, in war, no one would have the time to stop and have a conversation with another soldier about getting to know them"" or ""This movie isn't about the characters *in* the war, it's about the war *itself* and the horrific nature that it possesses.""

Does anyone see what I mean? I'm not saying he's not entitled to his opinion or that he's ""wrong"", I just think that *he* almost didn't believe his only criticism of the film and it came off as quite strange. Also (again, *my* opinion), considering that he graded Insomnia, Batman Begins, and The Prestige (both excellent films, to be sure, but still with a few undeniable flaws) all as ""perfect"", A+ masterpieces and yet gave this an A and came up with a very silly ""flaw"" to pick at...well, I guess it just shows that he really sees Nolan's films from an *entirely* different and odd angle than the majority (as evidenced from the lowER scores on RT and MC for those films and the ridiculously HIGH scores for this one).

Anyways, that's my two cents. I think this is Nolan's 3rd absolute masterpiece along with Memento and The Dark Knight and is perhaps the greatest war film since Saving Private Ryan. And it seems almost all critics are agreeing with me on this one this time. :)",none,,2021-03-08 16:29:48.187951,0

I disagree.  
For those that know more about history you know that this is a very uneventful story.  One about a lot of soldiers on a beach.  Trapped from one side and the other with nowhere to go but wait.  Now I can understand Nolan's vision for the most part.  How he views this event as monumental in the shift of the war and how it affects our time today, and it is true about how monumental it was but it doesn't work as a tale of nonfiction.  When you know that it all turns out okay.  When there are hardly any monumental casualties for the amount of lives at risk. How in the end, the score of Zimmer is as worthless as the story arc.  

I understand the passion for the project but this event does not work as a story.  Because although it is shown there are lives at risk it is known that almost nothing happens to them and they all survive.  Why should we as an audience care for the 5 main characters who are split over 3 different time pieces? (although not necessarily true because two of them are continuously intertwined while the other one is set differently until about halfway through the movie which is a very odd choice and doesn't blend well.) 

There is no characterization involved what so ever and if we know they are not going to die why is there a sense of tension involved in cuts between storylines where we don't care with a score that really puts all the effort into the emotion of a scene. 

The score of Zimmer throughout the film encompasses a ticking clock to represent the idea of time running out.  But it truly isn't like that because although they remain waiting all 400,000 men spread across the long beach while only occasionally there are a couple German planes that come to drop bombs all the while they have ally pilots chasing them from behind so is there really any high chance of colossal danger for each soldier?  It doesn't make sense to me.  

So it is a simple story that is made complicated by a terrible story arc with characters we don't care about when we know that they aren't really even in danger.  The outcome of the story is bland.  Plus there are really only two parts in the film where you realize that maybe perhaps Nolan is trying to add emotion without the overuse of Zimmer.  When you realize the ""two soldiers on land"" story is behind the ""Mark Rylance saving Cillian Murphy"" storyline and when Murphy accidentally kills the young boy on Rylance's boat.  That is it.  

The film, in my opinion, would have been so much more compelling and intense if it would be shown in chronological order and by themselves.  Part 1: The Air.  Part 2: The Land. Part 3: The Sea. 

It would be so much more compelling because it would show the outcomes of each character while keeping good pacing which would allow for us to become more familiar and enticed with the certain character.  Such as: Part 1: Tom Hardy. Part 2: The Two Soldiers (Styles and the other Main)  Part 3: Mark Rylance, the two boys on ship, the crashed Pilot, Cillian Murphy, and the oil fire/saving of Dunkirk. The third act sounds a lot more theatrical and has a lot more finality. 

The first part would end with Hardy being captured by the Nazis.  The Second with the Styles and the soldiers trying to escape the drowning ship after the tides had changed and the enemy soldiers had shot through the ship for target practice.  And the third part would end as the movie did.  I think this would make for a much more theatrical experience of an event with little theatrics. 

Now not to say I didn't like the movie... This could be argued as Nolan's greatest achievement in directing.   The directing is magnificent.  The editing I think is the best it could be with such a jarring and abrupt, non-linear film.  The performances are fine but as the acting and characters are not handled as the highlights of the films there was no need to cast actors of such high caliber or popularity such as Branaugh, Rylance, or even Styles. The practicality of the film is incredible as well. 

In the end, I feel there was a better course for this story but it came out as a spectacle with high class filmmaking but no substance just as history wrote it.

But the problem is when your movie is based off of one of the most well known ""miracles"" in modern military history, in which it is also well known that the rescue of the soldiers at Dunkirk was successful, then the choice to rely on the audience's engagement in the event rather than the characters is a huge fucking mistake. The suspense is gone. It should be suspenseful whether or not the characters that we are connected to survive BUT instead it's whether or not.....these guys...will survive.

You are dragged in to the characters not because they might have a family ect but just because of the horrific events they are having to live through and the horrific journey to escape and what they go through emotionally. The film is in a chronological order based on each set of scenes the soldiers drowning on the ship ect happens at a different time that’s why when cillian Murphy is rescued you see him later on alive and well it’s to highlight the effect the war had on him as when we first see him he is shaking and terrified yet when we see him as he was before he was a strong and brave leader. Therefore the scenes of the soldiers getting on the boat which sinks and having to swim to shore clearly happens before the civilian boat rescued the first soldier. The film is intended to be emotionally captivating due to simple human emotion we are meant to feel for the characters without having to know anything about them besides it adds to the reality of the film as they are fighting for their lives are they truly going to stop to introduce themselves and spout their life story ect while sitting in the freezing water scrambling for safety. Overall the film was well done as it was intended but if you need to know the characters well in order to care then it is not the film for you,none,,2021-03-08 16:29:51.861475,1

It's a pretty common 'technique', see Berkoff's The Trial - specifically all of their white faces and blank expressions, and it fits perfectly with the aesthetic of the film. 300,000 men stranded, all are on the same beach, nothing separates them; they are all the same person. Desperate to get back home, Nolan isn't focussing on what they have to get back home to or what drives them to get back home, rather it is human survival and natural instinct that groups them together; to escape death.

However, completely agree with everything technically that was said, i.e. editing, sound, etc. Also, wasn't so keen on the 'GoPro' shots, thought that these were a little overused.

P.S. How amazing was Harry Styles? Legitimately thought that he was amazing. What's more didn't even recognise him during the film and it only clicks after I looked it up.",none,,2021-03-08 16:29:51.863124,0

Maybe he wanted to keep it minimalistic with the no talking and no character development so we can focus on the event. But how can we get the sense of dread and hopelessness the brits were having when there were barely any enemies in the movie
 like take saving private ryan. The opening scene really puts you into the horror and dread of normandy. The scaling isn't as big there either, but the movie does a great job of putting you into the horror that occured.

When he went to take a shit the first chance he got, not noticing that someone was burying someone, then went to help him, that was enough for me. When the two of them took a wounded body to the ship, not to get him to safety, but to save themselves, that was enough for me.

Nolan wrote and directed but nobody acknowledges that the cinematography was somebody else's work. A lot of the credit people give Nolan should actually go to the the cinematographer who I'm sure nobody can name without checking IMDB.
The editing is bad. I don't mind entirely when a film shows you a different perspective or messes with yours but this was so strange as to confuse the entire films timeline as opposed to select segments.
The moments of tension weren't all that tense because it was for some reason hard to suspend my belief that most of the protagonists if not all, would come out alive and fine. 
That one kid died. The one that gave his backstory as he was dying.
I think it would have been a good film, an interesting film, a film worth defending if it had focused on the people that kept going back and forth on their boats and occasionally we saw or heard about what was happening through the soldiers while in the boats.
This film is visually an 8 because while beautiful it didn't add anything spectacular to the screen. Audio, as I had to watch it at home I won't judge but sound even at home it sounds amazing.
Character, the only one I cared about was the boatman while I was interested to see where the boy and the frog would end up, I never cared if either made it off Dunkirk, hell I would have preferred if the English kid hadn't while the French one had made it to England in time for tea and biscuits.
I've heard people say or defend the film by saying if Nolan had wanted to add character or narrative he could have. That's it, that's their defence. A director's ability to do something which isn't implemented into a film doesn't add to the film's value. It's like going to a pizzeria and getting a pepperoni pizza and it comes without tomato sauce or cheese. Sure the cook could have added those things but why would he. His tasteless pepperoni and dough is masterpiece enough.

You keep saying that ""this movie is not about the characters"" ""of course the music doesn't stop! that's the point! it's genius!"", as you want to prove the world you are smarter than the rest of the world because you think only you can understand the ""art"" of Nolan. Let me make some points:

1- This movie is character AND plot-driven. In almost every plot-character-driven movie characterization matters. And Dunkirk is not another kind of movie. It's character and plot driven. So, why you insist characters don't matter in Dunkirk? Is because it's an atmospheric war movie? That's bullshit. Several characters are introduced in this movie such as Tom Hardy or Kenneth Branagh. Tom Hardy appears at the end like an important figure, how do you keep saying that characters don't matter? Being atmospheric and focusing on the battle doesn't mean characters don't matter. And btw, these characters are bullshit. They are given almost null development until the third act. So, maybe that's another contradiction. If they are not supposed to have characterization, why the movie starts to really focus on them in the third act? Your thesis make no sense.

2- Cut the shit with the music crap. You don't seem to understand what is the purpose of music in movies. It's there to point out and enhance what the visual narration is trying to convey. So, if the music NEVER SHUTS THE HELL UP it loses its purpose. Now Nolan fanboys are thinking ""But the music has a deeper, metaphorical, spiritual meaning. It's there to tell the audience we're in a war all the time."" Well, apart from being pretentious, that's not even true. The music only stops for a second in the train, but when we cut to the next scene in the train the music is playing again! So no, there's no deeper meaning. And we don't need music playing in the background all the time when they're in Dunkirk. Maybe if something dramatic is happening, like deaths or tension, you can put music. But in some  moments (like the family in the boat)  the music is annoying and unneeded. We're just witnessing a family in a boat sailing in the sea, stop the music until something major happens!

Remember, an intentional point isn't always a good one.",none,,2021-03-08 16:29:52.855337,0

In this movie I didn't get a sense that there 300k+ of people they were trying to rescue.  On top of that it didn't seem like the Germans were pressuring them that hard.  Based off the movie it felt like the Brits struggled to  rescue about 500 men and didn't put much of any effort into doing it.  On the land side about 10 drunk German soldiers  penned  them down.

You never really see any German soldiers in the movie and honestly I feel like that makes the thought of them, as a threat, way more scary.

I didn't care much about any of the people involved...not even Rylance. The fact that there are two boys in that boat, you know one of them is not going to make it, to make his death so melodramatic underlines the fact that there is actually very little story going on here. I was surprised that someone whose made such thought provoking pieces in the past could come up with something that kind of seems pedestrian. I was only invested in Tom Hardy's storyline for a little while because it seemed a little tricky at first. My main annoyance comes from something that Jeremy actually likes. I have seen better visuals in much lesser war movies. The hopelessness of Thin Red Line, that one haunting continuous shot of Dunkirk evacuation from Atonement...had more profound effect on me; and here you are rescuing hundreds of thousands of people, the scope for grand visuals is immense and honestly the whole time it looked like there were 500 people on that beach that needed to be rescued. Sometimes all you can hear is that blaring sound, which is now increasingly becoming an irritating trope of all of Nolan's movies. I mean we get it Hans Zimmer is great at scoring movies. Maybe the problem is I went in with a lot of expectations with my father whose now retired from the armed forces, and at the end of it we both looked at each other thinking ""what was all that for?""",none,,2021-03-08 16:29:53.379546,0

Without Dunkirk, the war (or parts of it) may have panned out differently. We want them to succeed (collectively) to maintain hope.

Nolan is trying to get the audience into the movie. He wants them to feel, as much as possible, what a British soldier would have felt on the beach of Dunkirk in 1940. And as such, he wants the audience to be largely ignorant and confused--just like the solders would have been.

This is not a feel-good Hollywood romp where everything is laid before you on a platter. This is intended to be a realistic movie about survival.

Here's what I thought, if you even care. (ALL OPINIONS HERE)

PROS:
- amazing cinematography 
- phenomenal sound design (Oscar-worthy)
- good pacing, wasn't bored while viewing
- lack of dialogue was actually good with forcing you to notice the elements and didn't enforce boring exposition
- good choice of preferring practical or special effects (Tom Hardy actually flew in a plane)
- the locations and physical elements like the foam on the beach really blew me away for some reason. It was a very physical aesthetic film because of it.

CONS:
- music mistook me for a time bomb because of the extensive ticking
- I confused the characters for other people because they all were dark-haired, white, and young (Harry Styles was in it? The fuck?)

OVERALL:
This is a sensory experience, not a character-driven story. I absolutely loved it, and watching it in IMAX theaters was terrific as well. A lot of people don't like movies without huge amounts of dialogue because it makes you feel comfortable. I'm glad it was directed this way simply because it drew attention to everything else (sound and set design hardly gets credit in movies, but Dunkirk gave it a standing ovation).

Character, editing, pacing. All pretty crap. I've seen it twice and I still didn't really like it. I went into this film with no expectations since I hadn't really seen anything about it. I hadn't watched any trailers. I just saw everyone raving about it so I though ""that sounds good"". I know the real story of dunkirk so I was expecting to like it. But I thought it was just a bit naff. The characters had no character. I didn't care of any of them. I could hardly tell them apart from each other and even when I could, it didn't matter because none of them were unique. I get that might be trying to show about soldiers as a collective entity or something, but it just made me not care. Like it was, ""soldier 1, soldier 2, ohh that guy. Oh did he die? Ok.. I didn't know him. Oh that random guy who hopped on the boat for no reason, he got stupidly hit to the floor. Oh he's blind. Cool. Oh he's dead... cool."" There was no emotional weight to anything that anyone did. Also the pacing was dogshite. I respect what they TRIED to do. It was a cool idea to have all the different perspectives across different times, but it was not done well. Without any clear transitions between places, and no defined characters, the whole thing just kinda mushed together in a big never ending mess. There was no build up to any payoffs and nothing meant anything. It was weightless. This was such a shame for me because I really wanted to like it. It sounded great.

It's non-linear structure is not effective at all when you don't really care about the people on land. The reason Saving Private Ryan was so successful is because you followed real people in a disgusting circumstance. War is violent and hell, you have to understand that there are real people with stories fighting and losing their lives. Dunkirk just isn't memorable in that way. It's a beautiful movie and I understand the message completely. That there are hundreds of thousands of people who lost their lives and we don't even know their names but it doesn't serve the narrative structure well.

Don't get me wrong lots of it worked well but what gave it a cheap straight to dvd feel was the poor continuity and lack of accurate period detail. My main observations:-
1. A very modern and very clean and intact town of Dunkirk- Dunkirk was a blazing chaotic ruin.
2. The vast empty beaches with small groups of soldiers waiting by the waters edge- there were 400,000 British and  many French and Belgian troops clogging those beaches
3. The weather- it played a massive part in the evacuation- very calm sea very hot period of weather that allowed the Nazi's  to bomb the area. The weather then become overcast which allowed some breathing space for the evacuation to proceed relatively unhindered. This is never acknowledged
4. There were drunken deserters looting and hiding out in the town
5. Where was the large presence of French and Belgian troops? Noticeable by their  absence
6 The evacuating troops were totally exhausted- they had been fighting a retreat for over 2 weeks with little sleep food or water- they could hardly climb the ropes to access the ships.
7 Several scenes of ships returning to the UK with evacuated troops onboard showed no more than a single thin line of extras standing along the side of the ship facing the camera.
8. On returning to the UK evacuated troops were seen sitting on modern railway carriage seats with their distinctive blue covered seat fabric. 

9 50000 men were left behind- this film - like every other Dunkirk movie- glosses over this
The film was good- it was suspenseful from start to finish but the overall cheap look- poor period detail and lack of large crowds undermined the movie for me.",none,,2021-03-08 16:29:53.945670,0

I believe the lack of dialogue was intentional. The movie focuses on three different plots that may have actually occured on Dunkirk.

We weren't meant to see these characters as unique individuals because they were meant to resemble the idea that they could have been anyone.

And I think the situations being hard to follow didnt matter because what matters is that these people were in a dangerous situation of great intensity. But this is all just my opinion.",none,,2021-03-08 16:29:53.945756,6

Nolan didn't jump on the Hollywood bandwagon and have a back story for the characters, he did it the way he felt this story should be told and that is through true events and picking at your emotions.

You saw those borderline kids get overcome with emotion in that boat filling up with water on the shore, only to be forced into cooperation to plug the holes, risking all their lives. The movie taught me so many things about the tendency of human nature and war; that war has no victors; that you can depend on only yourself, and that sometimes you will fail yourself and it will still be your fault. That emotion is both what gives our humanity and takes it away from us at times. Still, your reviews for like almost every other movie I have watched are pretty accurate (i.e. at this point if you say a movie is shit then I can safely skip it).

The audience is thus put in the shoes of a soldier there at the time; feeling uncertain, anxious, powerless and afraid. You have misunderstood the purpose of the film. It was a snapshot into one of the most horrific historical events in recent history, not a typical bullshit war film. The characters were left undeveloped as there were so many young men there that both lived and died that they all seemed to blur into one helpless individual. The film was a masterpiece in illustrating Dunkirk's true horrors and the impact it had on those affected. From this video you simply come off as uneducated and impatient. The film was boring?

However, that does not exclude it from criticism as a film. A film needs characterisation because it allows the audience to connect to an event - fictional, or in this case, historical  -in a way that more personally links to our own experience of life. A representation of an event that took place, however tragic and beautifully conveyed, without character development is a documentary.  

I don't think the movie was boring by any means; the pacing, action and tension built by the sound design and visuals were more than satisfactory. (I think the editing involving the alternate timelines was a mess and unnecessary, but that's not the point I want to make here.)  However, it did lack characterisation. My favourite parts are where with Mark Rylance's character and his son are on the sail boat. Why? Because I connected with their plight more, because I felt I knew them better than the other characters. People FEEL more when they care more about the characters, when you give a shit about what they give a shit about. It's not a matter of, ""Oh you have no sympathy for people dying!"" Of course I do, but as a human, you care MORE for someone you've formed an emotional attachment with. This is different from a documentary, in which you're hearing a real-life account of someone's experiences. They're real, so you connect with them and their plight more readily. The fictional characters in a film need to work more to make you care for them on the same level. It's not that you're not saddened by seeing death, it's that they need to feel real enough to you in order to connect with the audience at a personal level. Dunkirk may be the main character, but it's not the protagonist, because it can't be. 

For those of you who haven't seen it - check out Atonement. There's a five minute, one take scene of one of the protagonists and his friends taking in Dunkirk. It's breathtaking and very emotional.",none,,2021-03-08 16:29:54.367440,5

For the first time, me and Jeremy disagree on something. I loved the movie beginning to end (I'm British, maybes not completely unbiased), the sound was intense and submersed you in the action, and as you said, the visuals were amazing. Where we disagree is when it comes to characters, I feel that the Movie was about 400,000 men and the 800 boats sent to rescue them, not the individuals. It was made to make you feel their overall despair and then their hope when salavtion was at hand. As far as I'm concerned it did that spot on and focusing on a few characters and their backstories would have bogged everything down. 10/10 from Len.",none,,2021-03-08 16:29:54.367619,0

There would not be a lot conversation in reality - hence a lack of dialogue from the soldiers in the film.

Dreadful from start to finish, the Nolan direction of zimmer to fall asleep on his keyboard again like the utter pile of shite, interstellar. There were 400,000 on that beach trying to get off and thousands of tiny craft sailed by civilians to rescue them..... The clown Nolan couldn't even get that right, he had about 500 on the empty beach (despite the Brits abandoning trucks, tanks heavy weapons etc) and he had the big payoff emotional shot of the civilian flotilla with about 8 boats in it!!! Not to mention the dreadful location management.... Look at the buildings in the very prominent background on the beach. All of them 1960's/70's at the earliest architecture and today at latest, not to mention every building clearly having double glazing. Then there is the plane bollocks at the end..... Shoots down a plane from an unmentioned enemy country and then spends the next 4 minutes gliding like a kite!

Jeremy, i think you missed the titles in the beginning of the film. At the start, it displays three titles: the mole - one week, the sea - one day, the air - one hour... these titles indicate that the film is spanning across three different timelines that eventually intersect as the film progresses, for ie. the stuff with the three guys takes place for a week long, the guys on the boat are in one day and the tom hardy air fights is literally just one hour.

John Campea even went out of his way to say he applauded Jeremy for speaking his mind as a critic and going against public opinion.  Now I've seen the movie and I completely agree with every point Jeremy made.  It was a grim, realistic ""experience"" of a movie.  I didn't enjoy it, it just happened AT me (if that makes sense).  When the civilian boats show up I felt some emotion but I mainly drained and was just happy the film was going to end.  Realistic war films can be harsh (Saving Private Ryan) but still be character driven.  Heck I absolutely love the Band of Brothers TV show and that is very harsh experience.  I think I have a love hate relationship with Christopher Nolan.  I'm glad I saw this movie but will never be watching it again.",none,,2021-03-08 16:29:54.840303,0

Also it was edited kind of badly. Honestly this movie was not good at all... Wouldn't watch again. They should have done a movie about the battle over Britain instead of this.

But i went to see Dunkirk, because of Nolan. And you know what? For the first time I am going to see this movie again in the theater. Because there are no clishes, there are no story arc of certain individual who becomes / is heroic in the course war terrors, which turnes war into something romantic and not that scary as it is. This film is absolutely great because of it immersive atmosphere and new way of telling the story in a war film. I've never seen something like this before,.

I for one, totally get what Nolan was going for in this - the characters didn't have a ton of characterization per se because in real life, you don't really sit around and talk about yourself, certainly not if you're in a situation like that.
I know Jeremy mentioned realistic is not always better but coming from a military family, I really loved this depiction of war - it seemed so much closer to the archives my family keeps from WWII than almost any other war film I've seen about that time.

I think this movie was brilliant. I saw it last night and I've been thinking about the way it was directed. For starters, the only character whose name we get to know is the 17 year old boy who dies ""George Mills"". Which I thought was very interesting. Also with the editing. What I took away from it was, going from one very intense scene to all the sudden nothing going on, is exactly what combat is like. Very intense moments of fighting, followed by boredom and silence. As far as not knowing who anyone really is seems intentional. If you were in their situation, a lot of people from your unit could've been killed or just spread out everywhere. Like the very first scene, the character is walking with some guys from his unit and they all are shot in the street except for him. I imagine in reality a lot of people on that beach were just survivors from wiped out units from all over France and a lot of people didn't know each other and were just trying to get home. Friendships bonded over doing that exact thing, which we saw when the two soldiers find the man on the stretcher and try to get a spot on the boat by rushing up the pier with him. By the way, Tom Hardy's as the RAF pilot was bad asssss. The scenes where he is just gliding over the beach back and forth was pretty awesome. I'm guessing he turned off his engine to glide and turned it back on when  he had to turn around?

This is all just my opinion and it could be wrong. I like having to think about movies like this and would like to know what you guys think.",none,,2021-03-08 16:29:55.326358,0

I was impressed visually too by the visuals of the airplane shots. I have never seen airplane shots filmed like this before. I was impressed by where they put the cameras on the planes in this film. This film was unique in that we were seeing more inside the sinking ships. This was the first time we have really gotten the chance to see what is like inside of a sinking ship with lots of people in a water filled compartment. The most we have ever seen before was Titanic and Pearl Harbor. Even then not much of those scenes tends to be shot inside of a water filled compartment. Most of the time those scenes are brief and we see what is going on the perspective from those seeing the events from the outside more than the inside so this explored the dangers and tensions more than other war films. This was also an unusual film in that this was an evacuation film rather than an invassion battle film. Usually evacuations are not seen in a War film. Also this film was unusual in that we never saw the Nazis in this film besides the planes or they were out of the distance, the bulets, and out of focus towards the end. That created tension in this film not too unlike that of Jaws in it was not about seeing the shark. It is about what we don't see that is more frightening. I thought it was interesting how little of the French we saw in this film even though the film takes place in France. Also this film was unusual in that we saw the civilians playing a active part in actually resqueing the people. That is not tipical of a war film. Usually civilians are the victums or the military is protecting the military not the civilians going out being the heros resquing the military. That is highly unusual. Also the civilian boats were smaller and harder targets unlike the huge military vessels that are easier targets. I was impressed that this was able to put the story lines of Land, sea, and air together so well. I will agree that this is probably not a film I will buy on DVD and is not the best war film I have seen before.",none,,2021-03-08 16:29:55.326646,0

The realistic element is one of its best qualities, it does not glamourise it, it is paying tribute to the thousands of young men who lost their lives. The point of there being no backstories was that these soldiers HAD NO BACKSTORIES. They were young men, no wives, no kids, they were just starting out in life. With regard to the minimal dialogue, I thought this was excellent, one of Nolan's greatest qualities as a director. To progress a story through music, camera shots, and diegetic sounds of guns and bombs, is AMAZING. The story is intense, it's real life.

I cannot, however, justify the bland/boring statement. You need to understand what war is to like this movie for what it is, and some people seem to have a preconceived view where there is always a hero and always a villian, and the hero tears the enemy to shreds and saves the day, coming back home to his worried wife and/or child, and there's just a happy ending. This is NOT how war works. Everyone is vulnerable-anyone and everyone is mortal and can die if they are in the radius of a bomb or hit with a bullet, or are in a ship that's internally flooded- panic and struggle take over, not intellect of ""Ooh, how am I gonna get out of this one?"" Similarly, for character development, there isn't any for a reason- in war, do you think a commanding officer would want to get someone off the beach because he heard a story that he has a wife and family back home? If he ain't there in time, he is not getting of that boat, it would be all about getting as many people out as quickly as possible, not the people who you think are the most worthy. The film isn't character driven because it doesn't need to be- instead , it is driven by the event, the horror of war, the desperation and pushed into place by Zimmer's score. The film forces to you to not care ABOUT the characters, but BECOME them; feel and see what they feel and see: Loud and deadly gunshots, the horrific screams of the German planes engines (Which were, as a historical fact, made to crush morale,) the screams of your fellow soldiers and they die, and you can do nothing about it. I get that some people are driven by character development, but this is the most realistic and engaging view of war I personally have ever seen, and I hate to say it, but if you discount this movie based on the fact that you are too hung up on the fact that you don't know if there is a wife or family or backstory for the characters of this film, then you should reconsider your stance on how and why you view movies.",none,,2021-03-08 16:29:55.727737,0

My point is, its not about what a director is trying to show, it is also about how the audience or critics perceive and take in the info on the screen. You cant call Jeremy Jahns's opinion wrong just because he perceived it differently from you.

Good points : 
- cinematography
- sound-design
- no CGI

What I didn't like : 
- nameless characters (Cillian Murphy is credited as ""Shivering Soldier"" for fuck's sake)
- no backstory whatsoever to any of them (I didn't want much, just enough so that I could care)
- no memorable theme.
- so many drowning-scenes (just a nitpick though)

Maybe it's because I'm too fucking used with movies with a lot of dialogue and exposition but this, didn't cut it for me. 

And I got what the movie intended : placing you with the boys and see the spectacle as if you were there and show the different sides of the story : the guys stuck at the beach, the spitfires and the civilians with the boat. Trust me, I get the movie, it's just I didn't like it or rather, because it was a Nolan movie, my expectations got too high and I thought I'd be in for mindblowing experience on all fronts.

In the end, you don't root for one single character to make out, you root for all of them. I was at the edge of my seat during many scenes (the Heinkel+oil=fire scene and many others) The way the story is told is fantastic, with different timespans and different characters meeting. the tone of the movie is set in a way to give urgency to the audience, to make you feel like time is running out.

It forces you to focus on the sights and sounds you see before you, the dogfights, the stuck dive bombers and their terrifying screeches, the near drownings, the gunshots, and the feeling amongst the soldiers of utter defeat and hopelessness as the enemy closes in and watching as your means of escape are sunk before your eyes all while home is right their, a few miles across the English Channel.",none,,2021-03-08 16:29:56.177297,24

And hats off to Christopher Nolan for staying true to the story of Dunkirk. First off I agree it looked amazing in IMAX. On your first point about lack of character depth I think a good reason for that is because the film isn't about just them, it's about all of the hundreds of thousands of men that are stranded and trying to survive to get home. And for me that's the main reason to care about these people. Having the characters discuss home lives would be completely irrelevant, not to mention impractical. After all they're trying to make it through the next, week, day and hour. They aren't going to have time to stop for a chat about their personal lives. On the day and night issue that's because I believe 'the mole' sections on land took place over a week, 'the sea' over a week and 'the air' over an hour. This makes sense since all the events didn't take place at once.

In fact, I would say that what the characters are like back home is of very little relevance in that moment in time.  Cillian Murphy's character may have been a pillar of the community and an all around stand-up guy back home, but that's not who he is now.  That person may have died the first time a bullet wizzed past his head, or when his ship sank and everyone else on it drowned.

The characters are not developed at all, and was probably done intentionally.  The sense of tension starts right from the beginning, and it never lets up.  Also some stunning cinematography.  

I would disagree that the movie is unfocused. I think Nolan didn't want to sidetrack the Battle of Dunkirk with characters.  What sometimes happens in war movies is we get too enveloped in a number of character's personal stories, and the war around them almost becomes secondary to their development.  Dunkirk is entirely about the battle.  In that way, the movie is VERY focused.",none,,2021-03-08 16:29:56.178192,0

It's the anti-Pearl Harbour and it's great. It's not about the characters (and their wives, or teaching background) I think, it's about the soldiers (and their sacrifice and bravery). I think of it as a excerpt of the Britannica Encyclopedia in which I'm learning about the Dunkirk evacuation, not the biography of each and every soldier. The emotions don't come from sentimentality but rather from intensity of the event. I even like it better than Saving Private Ryan because it doesn't pause a minute to tell me about the lives of the brave soldiers. Instead, this is a very cut and dry depiction of war which I think illustrates very the real world distance that the general public can feel toward an event that took place ""many years ago"" to people who ""we never met"".

You had to be paying close attention at the beginning but the movie is in three sections : 1) The Mole - the events at the beach itself and these events in the film take place over 1 week. 2) The Sea - this is the little ships coming over the channel to rescue the men, which takes place over 1 day. 3) The Air - the spitfire  attacks where these events take only 1 hour. ALL these sections are in play through out the movie and all come together at the end. Dunkirk was gorgeously edited to convey all the different moving components which made Dunkirk one of the biggest moments of the entire war. All 'the average looking men with dark hair' were the most realistic choices as Nolan chose primarily unknown actors as not to distract from the story. I feel that as a British person, I connected with this poignant film on a level which I never have on any film before and I would hate for this review belittling this film to put any one off watching it.

Yeah it was definitely a first for Nolan. A true story with no exact twists.

Dunkirk is a survival movie as much as it is a war movie.  Everything comes together in order to place the viewer in what was a dreadful waking nightmare.  I found it equal parts realistic and surrealistic, in the sense that the sound design and pacing keeps you on the edge the entire time, and the very few moments of silence in the film are shocking.  You almost feel like something is wrong, as your senses are suddenly and unexpectedly not being assaulted.  

The sparse dialogue further contributed to this overall effect.  400,000 men trapped on a strip of sand waiting to die... any inclusion of misty eyed reminiscing about their wives and family, i feel, would have taken away from what the movie was trying to portray.  It would have broken the pacing, and given the audience a moment to relax, which is NOT what you want for this type of film.  Dunkirk, for me, was about terror.  The kind of fear that you would  sacrifice your loved ones in order to escape.  Being stripped of everything that makes you human (which includes your family and personality).  A brilliant moment in the movie (SPOILERS) is when the young soldier from the opening scene is underneath the pier and hears the officers talking about the evacuation plan.  What he hears is grim, and speaks volumes about what all the men on that beach were thinking.  

I heard someone (can't remember who) say that this movie was an two hour long panic attack that you were glad you had.  I couldn't put it any better.  During the movie I was wishing for it to just be over, which is what I imagine only a fraction of what the troops at Dunkirk were experiencing.  Once it ended, I wanted to watch it again.  Really brilliant movie, probably my favorite movie of the year, and definitely my favorite war movie of all time.",none,,2021-03-08 16:29:56.574206,7

It was so goddamn beautiful, and when I first started watching it, I had a box of tissues next to me, in case a character that I got attached died or something, you know. However, through the entire thing, all I could see was  the desperation in their eyes to survive, and all I could think, ""Who are you? I know you're supposed to be the protagonist and all, but why should I root for you to survive?"" At that much character development given, it was less of following the journey of our protagonist and his team fighting for survival, and more of a silent documentary on the Animal kingdom, of who's more likely to kill the other one, with me not caring at all about what was going on. I have a pretty good attention span, and I can usually sit through and pay attention to an entire film. So the fact that this film had me reaching for my phone before it reached the 1 hour mark kind of astounded me.
I'm sorry, but I didn't buy the tickets hoping for an engaging historical document. Already seen those, I wanted to see the story brought to life. Realism is essential, but for films, only to a certain extent, which is why many directors take it upon themselves to dramaticize the events. For example, Titanic did a pretty damn good job of portraying the events of the sinking, while also giving us 2 characters and a sub plot to engage with, and root for. I love Christopher Nolan is one of my favourite directors, but quite honestly, he kind of disappointed me with this film.",none,,2021-03-08 16:29:56.574391,0

You simplified a movie down to visuals and characters; when there's so much more. The tone and intent of the film made this movie, as well as the direction and the spectical. You dont miss something that doesnt belong and Dunkirk didn't need characters. The idea is to experience the gripping horror of war. The tone is both bleak and inspiring. It is the truest essence of a war film. The film has nameless masses who could die at any moment, creating characters would detract from the tension. It would remove the element of surprise and shock. I felt trapped with them and I loved it.
Its fine you didn't like it, but I do feel (as cliche as it is) that you didn't get it. It's a movie that forces your mind to work in a way that a nameless soldier would. I think you just didnt allow yourself to be immersed in the experience.",none,,2021-03-08 16:29:56.574414,0

If you had you would know that the type of dialogue you are looking for DOES NOT HAPPEN when under heavy, intense, fire and you are just thinking about how to survive the next minute.  The conversations that do happen are more like who's hit, how much ammunition do we have left, we need to retrieve the radio from the kid we just saw head explode.   That's combat.  There is now character arc, there is survival arc, and if you are in command, how to get as many of your guys out of there as possible, even if it means loosing your own life.  If you do make out, for days, sometimes weeks, everyone who has seen combat before has the million mile stare.  You leave that guy be until he comes back to earth and you can help him, because anything you tell him then could make him snap, commit suicide or next time in combat, just give up and let himself be shot, or walk up to and grab what is obvious a poorly camouflaged IED.  Dunkirk is war.  So was the first 20-30 minutes of Saving Private Ryan.  In that opening sequence, how many conversations did you see. NONE.  That's because that the way combat works.  You are in every moment, or you are as good as dead.  Orders is what you give and hear, that's it.  And in the case of Dunkirk, their rush to the sea was so fast, most of their equipment was left behind.  You name me ONE veteran of a war that WANTS to talk about their experience, you won't find one.  The may share if close friends and family are around, but the only people they will  really talk to about it are the people that were out in the field with them.  Every memory of combat is crystal clear yet a complete blur.

So yeah, you are weird, you are an idiot and in my mind, since you have no personal experience with combat, and can't seem to wrap your head around this wasn't a 1950's movie about WWII, where every character was had an arc, and the movie was 4 hours long.  The majority of those movies happen over years.  Dunkirk is about a moment in time, where if those nearly 500,000 men are not recued from that beach, the war is over.  Germany has the whole of Europe unopposed and can just bomb the shit out of Great Britain,  The U.S. cannot logistically get into the war because GB is all but lost, no forward operating base.


You are clearly not a big picture mind.  Nor are you able to understand this was ONE singular battle, beautifully shot and caught the single feeling every soldier on that beach felt, 'Please God, save me.'  I know that feeling.  I've had to talk soldiers down from that.  There are actions and reactions.  That's it.  Maybe since you don't understand combat, battles or what it does to soldiers, maybe, just maybe, you give your reviews a second thought or just not post them.  Your blithely ""where are the characters, where are their arcs?""  Comes off as incredibly insensitive to the men who on that beach, and every soldier pinned down in combat.",none,,2021-03-08 16:29:56.968969,0

Tom Hardy's character saw his friend waved to signal that he landed safe on water and escaped. The scene than goes to the friend and it did not play the same way in Tom Hardy's point of view. So the editing was very off on that one.

Another thing was Cillian Murphy's character. We did not see how his ship sank and it didnt tell a story of it. It feels as if his parts were cut out to focus on other things and to leave it to the imagination of the viewer.

I do feel the same way as this review. The characters i like are Tommy, Mr. Dawson, George, Tom Hardys and Kenneth Branagh character. That is the list of order.

I hope that Christopher Nolan does get his shine on the Oscar because it was well over due from The Dark Knight and Inception. This movie was a well done World War 2 that shows the struggle and horror of war. The mental toll of the human conditions, emotions and struggle to survive and the courage and hope to help other people in need. It did show case all these characteristic of human kind in this film. The cinematography of the film is jaw dropping and worth it in IMAX. The score is intense and the practical effects are amazing. It feels real.

Only thing missing is the dialogue of some key characters but the movie is great. Maybe top 5 of Nolans movie.

I thought a lot of the same things as you on my first viewing, but upon second watch I realized the movie was too good to completely absorb in one go. You don't even realize you're watching three different timelines the first time until like 45 minutes in. The movie isn't about any character's personal journey, it's about other things. You can identify with the miserable look on every soldier's face because they can be you, you don't need any of that Hollywood fluff, in fact now I believe it would have bogged down the realism and grit he was trying to portray. I personally kind of projected myself onto the main couple guys. It also took two viewings to put together the whole timeline which is seamless.

Also this is like a REAL movie. Nolan is one of the only huge filmmakers left who can still get a bunch of money and make the movie he wants to make. This wasn't another Avenger movie or something that's cranked out by a board room of executives twice a year and is clinically tested to be the most serviceable/inoffensive bombardment of noise possible.",none,,2021-03-08 16:29:56.969294,0

It was that ( in the theatre I saw it in) everything was slightly out of focus and put through a more grainy filter. I found it hard to place my eyes anywhere, and didn't have any direction in where to look; I found myself searching for what to look at. Basically, i didn't like it at all, and yes I understand it's meant to be realistic.

Sorry guys, but Jeremy's right. When you take a real event with real people and put it on screen, those real people now become characters.

I don't need lots of exposition and dialogue to make me care about a character. Most of them did it with just a look or two. Heck, Tom Hardy didn't show anything but his eyes most of the film, and I was fully on board with his mission and his troubles. Cillian Murphy's shell shocked solider was also great, as was the kid just trying to escape the whole time. I do agree Mark Rylance was the stand out, but I thought everyone did a great job.
This story not quite the visual storytelling on the level of Mad Max: Fury Road, but it was very close. 
I also liked the way it played with time and perspective, but I do understand why some people didn't care for that part quite as much. That can be a hard thing to wrap your head around if you're not expecting it.

By adding names, backstories, development, you thereby validate one character's survival over another. The soldiers we followed weren't supposed to stand out or give us a significant reason to root for them. You hit it on the head with ""this movie is about people"". Yes, absolutely. This movie isn't about a bromance, it's not about a group of friends, it's not about a son returning home, it's about Dunkirk and the people it affected. You say you don't know any of the characters and it bothered you yet for me that was so effective because the civilians who went and rescued soldiers off the shores of Dunkirk didn't know who they were saving, didn't know their backstory, and yet they wanted them to survive, the same way I was rooting for these characters to live. Moreover, with characters that act as blank slates, you can almost put yourself in their shoes (hence why parts were filmed first person POV), and feel the fear they would've felt yourself, which I most certainly did. Characters and names would defeat the whole purpose of the movie and the message we can take away from what happened. I understand that this movie wasn't for you and your opinion is of course valid I just don't understand how you could fault Dunkirk on that, as if it was a mistake Nolan made.  And you called the characters ""average looking"" but maybe that's because the majority of them were just average people, and the movie is a historical drama so it centers around realism. Not to mention the fact you called the film boring. I couldn't watch some parts they were so tense. There's always an underlying atmosphere of tension, helped by the continuous ticking.

I think this movies is about situation in general, not about ""main hero special"" story of private Ryan. I honestly can't remember any name from it. So basically if you could look in a story of another guy from that coast - you would see the same. (But you can obviously see different characters in different stories - stoic pilot or broken soldier for example). For me this movie showed much less popular side of war - not heroic, but hopeless and desperate chaos. On thing  would have liked to see is if Mark Rylance's boat saved a desperate and broken german pilot (who had a breakdown after being shotdown) - it would have shown the true chaos of war.",none,,2021-03-08 16:29:57.414521,0

To me if you wanted to show the different points of view, I think Nolan should've just had the scenes of the men from the land, sea, and air intercut and in chronological order. Another thing Nolan could've done would be to have one act focus on the men on the land, then another two acts for the men on the sea and in the air respectfully, and then the ending could be like the ending of the movie where it shows the final moments of all the different perspectives.

I wasn't blown away but ""Dunkirk"", either. I agree with you that it's gorgeous and had some very gripping moments. The acting was excellent to where I wasn't distracted by any performance oddities.  But, I didn't become invested in the movie overall. The time-jumbling editing may be ""masterful"" to some, but it confused me most of the time early in the movie. A lot of that is because so many of the people being followed were so generically similar that I didn't know who I was watching, so it took me a while to realize the time-jump-multiple-views-of-the-same-event thing was happening.

I was wondering if the ""can't tell who's who"" thing was done on purpose as some message about how people become ""units"" in war and cease to be seen as individuals, or somesuch. Regardless, that aspect of the movie would up making me less involved with the characters.

Regardless, stay being a weirdo, Jeremy. You're great at what you're doing.

I was looking forward to an epic telling of the MIRACLE of Dunkirk but instead all I got was a jacked up millennial version. There were no heroes nor villains mostly only cowards. It is a movie about cowards.
I cannot believe the shallow, abysmal writing. I am in shock that someone spent 100 million dollars to make this lukewarm piece of garbage. Nolan was apparently terrified to show any nationalism at all and went to incredible lengths to downplay the moral implications between the Allies and the Axis ie good versus evil.  That is the reason that he jumped immediately into the battle, it saved him from defining who was right and who was wicked. I have looked forward to a movie about Dunkirk since I learned about the story but this is not the telling of those people and their brave actions,  this is an attempt, imho, to rewrite history. Perhaps Nolan included the general elements, to include the over 300,000 men and the destroyers sunk etc. but the true heart of the story was completely lost and replaced with an ugly, sideways telling of an awe inspiring, providentially blessed event.",none,,2021-03-08 16:29:57.869688,18

They were all just one in the crowd, they weren't supposed to by anything special, because the film seems like it wants to focus more on the grand scale of the events being portrayed, rather than the individual characters themselves. Although I do agree with Jeremy on the fact that the editing and timeline makes it quite confusing at points. Our entire conversation in the car after seeing this movie was based around trying to figure out certain areas of the timeline, mainly with the pilots. I think this film will require a second viewing, but after one viewing, I definitely would recommend it, as the positives outweigh the negatives.

What's crazy is I think the film is more divisive amongst the general audience than critics, most professional critics are hailing Dunkirk.  I can TOTALLY understand why it is divisive and why Jeremy feels this way but I also feel a little disheartened that Jeremy did not realize or take the time to research what Nolan was actually trying to accomplish.  Again, Jeremy's criticism about the film not having any character to care about, while valid, is also a criticism due to lack of information.   Nolan took a risk by having the SITUATION, by having the immersivenss of the ACTION generate empathy for the characters because you are MEANT to be on the Mole with them, MEANT to be on Mr. Dawson's boat seeing oil covered soldiers racing, swimming for their lives towards your boat, you're IN the cockpit with Tom Hardy desperately trying to shoot down German bombers before they get to the escaping boats.  You're not watching omnipotently, this is the closest thing I've seen to first-person storytelling without the ""Go-Pro"" camera gimmick.   Nolan has long been accused of ""telling us how we should feel"" and now he goes ahead and, through pure visual filmmaking, ""shows us how to feel"" through the situation these soldiers are in and challenges us to experience the film WITH them, and what's funny is he's getting backlash for perhaps swinging too far to the other extreme.  I think if viewers, not just Jeremy, had Nolan's intentions mind it might change the way they view the film, and if they do criticize the film, it's because what he attempted to do DIDN'T WORK rather than critiquing what the film SHOULD HAVE done, like Jeremy is suggesting.  

But hey, any time you challenge the norms of the genre there will be some backlash.  Nolan took a little bit of flack for The Dark Knight because it wasn't a ""fun"" comic book movie because ""fun"" was the genre norm pre-Batman Begins days.  Prior to this, war movies had a lot of ""rah-rah"" patriotism, generals in rooms, loved ones pictures in pockets, and a group of archetypical misfits who personify the different attitudes and ways war affects people.  Nolan took away all that and at least for me, I still felt invested with these characters, even if I couldn't name them all.  I fist pumped when Tom Hardy shot down the last bomber, I held my breath while the Mole soldiers were trapped in the Dutch trawler, and I don't know but the last 5-10 minutes delivered an emotional punch for me.  This exchange sums it up for me:

Tommy (Fionn Whitehead):  ""All we did was survive"" 
Blind man (actually played by Nolan's uncle):  ""That's enough""

After seeing everything these men and BOYS did just to get back to those British shores, that line really did hit home.",none,,2021-03-08 16:29:58.304712,0

In my opinion the movie lacked two main things; emotion, and a clear plot line. Its hard to get emotion for people you know nothing about. Even if there is a cliche talking scene just telling about a characters past, maybe I would feel bad they didn't make it. The plot line is just so cluttered since there are 3 different parts to pay attention to, with random jumps in between, sometimes even with a jump back in time that if you were not paying attention you'll be confused as to what's going on watching a similar scene twice. Also, I'm not an expert on planes, but how long are you supposed to stay flying with no engine?

It didn't need gore or cheesy back stories which for me made it even more incredible. I would go as far as to say it's possibly the greatest war film ever made or it's certainly up at the top.

In a lot of was movies, you get to know the characters and understand the situation because of what it's based on in history, and it becomes predictable. A character might die here or there, but overall, you can usually predict what's going to go down. In this film, being thrust into the situation the way Nolan does it, you're unsure where it's going. In any other film, in the scene where the ship gets hit by the torpedo, I'd say, ""they have to get out, there's so much left to the film"". But because the focus of the movie wasn't on Fionn or Harry's character, I had no idea whether they'd live or die. The movie would be able to continue no matter what because there was so much else the movie immersed you in besides only those characters.

As a director, he is wildly overrated. He is good......but not that good. The hype around him is ridiculous. He is ambitious, but his films come across as an exercise in ego - huge on scope, but lacking in humanity, and consequently nearly always coming across bloated and pretentious, hollow on character and wit. Every single one. There's so little of the warmth that, say, Spielberg or Scorsese can infuse into their films. Granted, when he tries something like Inception, you can't help but be fascinated. But, in the end, he's just showing off. And all his films are so cold. 

Nolan is a victim of his own ego, and because his films are sooooo hyped and always visually stunning, he wins over those who like a technical exercise in bombastic filmmaking. It's like marvelling at a slick, new fangled machine, rather than a piece of art. Those saying this is high art are talking shit, and have been duped by Nolan's style. 

This film in particular comes across as pretentious to me. And also lazy, and slightly in bad taste - ANOTHER WWII film. So easy to mine people's emotions without needing proper characterisation, or story arcs. This is typical Nolan fair - it's all about the idea, not the actual art of film. He got to play with Spitfires, woopee! 

This is really about Nolan getting his war epic on his CV, and lazily borrows from history for it's soul and emotional heft (unsuccessfully).

 I reckon Nolan is a bit of an ego maniac, and he's not a true artist like the best auteurs. He's the intelligent mans Michael Bay. Both directors think like little boys about which huge spectacle they want to make next, and are only vaguely interested in storytelling, or the art of filmmaking.",none,,2021-03-08 16:29:58.306365,0

I really just did not get the movie. Just my personal opinion, but this movie would have worked better as a short film. The cinematography was amazing, but it was extremely repetitive and pretty boring at times. 

My biggest problems with the film:
-There was nothing special at all about the dogfight scenes. It was completely expected that the pilot would live through most of the film, and that created zero suspense in the scenes involving him
-It was supposed to be about a historical event, but the entire story arc with the guys trying to escape was made up. If the story is about the 300,000 people on the beach, why are we focusing on a few teenagers trying to sneak off? I think this is a major reason why people felt like the film lacked character development. Why put these kids in the film if they are just putting themselves over everyone else at the beach?
-The kid that died on the civilian boat. It did nothing for me. His death did nothing to contribute to the historical event, or describe the mental state of the rescued pilot. Its like he died just because there werent any deaths in that story arc and they needed to keep the suspense going.

I wanted to like this movie. I really did, but after an hour, I felt bored. I understand it was a great depiction of a historical event, but I really dont understand how this movie was as long as what it was. In my opinion, half of it could have been scrapped, and it would have given the same effect. Maybe the movie just wasnt what I was expecting at all.",none,,2021-03-08 16:29:58.306551,0

It was the most confusing movie ever. It confused me so much, I forgot what year it was, and I mean in real life, not the movie. The scale was way off. There were literally about 8 planes, 3 destroyers and 15 boats. How does that imply or support the fact that there are 400k men stranded on the beach? Seemed like 40k to me. On top of that if you do not know the history of Dunkirk, the whole movie will seem like a stupid joke. 400k soldiers stranded on the beach for many days for some reason, better yet they are not being attacked by German forces either, wtf is going on? Yet nothing was explained at all. All the characters were difficult to understand, so dialogue was incomplete most of the time and confused me even more. However, visually the movie was impressive. The sound was engrossing, realistic and terrifying at times. Dog fights were perfect and Tom Hardy's character was my favorite. I would much rather see a movie about that character alone than what Dunkirk turned out to be.

Christopher Nolan’s Dunkirk is really another run of Batman
and Inception’s, all excitement but lacking all historical accuracies.  Throughout the film, you can hear the ticking
of a watch’s seconds in the background noise, as to magnify the suspense and race
for time to save lives.  This is a
characteristics of Chris Nolan, building similar timeline suspense, as
previously found in the ‘The Dark Knight’, and ‘Inception’.  Special effects were kept to a minimum, which
is a good thing, for most movies about WW2 are now heavily digitalized, for it
is nearly impossible to bring back WW2 planes, ships, and related weapons for Hollywood
movies.  There is silly moment like when
a civilian boat captain spoke of ‘the sweet sound of the Spitfire’s Rolls Royce
Merlin engine’.  During the war, the
British would never disclose secrets of their fighter planes, let alone a
civilian boat captain would know about the detailing facts of the Spitfire.  The film also stirred up the patriotic charisma
and sacrifice of the English people during the disheartening retreat, but it is
too poetic when a Royal Navy Commander, cast by Kenneth Branagh, spoke
eloquently that “you all can leave, but I’ll stay for the French”.  Well, romantic it is, but that did not
happen.  Other ultimate sacrifice, like
of the family casual accepted loss of a young son due to the cowardice act of a
shell-shock British soldier, is seem way too artificial, to be choked up in
emotion.

Tom Hardy as the fighter pilot of the Spitfire is truly
inspiring and humble.  But again,
accuracies and facts fall really short when his plane flew for hours, shooting
down 2 Heinkel 111, and 3 ME109s. 
Throughout the film, his Spitfire blazes its machine gun, with endless
ammunition, when it is fact that a typical 1940 Spitfire can carry only enough
ammunition for less than 20-second continuous burst.  Dear God!!! 
Tom was able to shoot down a Stuka even when his Spitfire ran out of
fuel – WTF!

Nevertheless, the film has good actors, and the drama was
good.  Surprisingly, Harry Styles, the
teen heart throb, played his debut role in this film very well, casting as a
loud-mouth thug.  One would expect that
he would play a role of a pretty boy instead.

Overall, Dunkirk is a good, fictional war drama, based on
true events – a tall tale telling of Britain’s greatest struggle during the
darkest hour.  The film is well played
with faceless enemies, as the German is not portrayed in this movie, with minor
exception of flying ME109s, Heinkels, and blurry silhouettes of Werhmacht
soldiers.  Nolan did a fine job to make
England feel good all over again, and a fine work he did, for that country is
now having to deal with new face of evil in terrorism and radical
Jihadist.  Perhaps Nolan’s ‘Dunkirk’ is
the booster dose that Britain is now in need of.",none,,2021-03-08 16:29:58.787193,0

The questions is;  What the hell happened to the pilot in the Spitfire???  SPOILER ALERT!!!  Seems like it took 15 minutes at least before we knew he was still flying, then it took another 10 minutes for it to fly back and forth over the beach before it lands which is hard to do when your airplane has no fuel!!!  OMG, is this B.S. or what?  The worst part of this movie is that several story-lines are competing against one another like 5 horses in a photo finish race and each horse has a gopro and you're looking at everyone of them at the same time to see who's gonna win. The problem is that it takes so damn long to get to the finish line that I couldn't care less about which horse wins the damn race. BTW, no one clapped at the end, a lot of quiet people leaving the theater scratching their heads and saying ""wha?""  The sound was too f'ing loud, in fact I may have to see my doctor about it, must have been 120db at least!  It was louder than a AC-DC concert.

This intro is more clever than Nolan's new WWII movie. Yea Jeremy we are weirdo's because we aren't on the hype train for Nolan's dryest movie ever. It was perfect technically but for a war movie it was too orderly for the chaos and impeding doom to take over. I found myself marveling at the filmmaking it self than actually getting sucked into the story. Hacksaw Ridge is far more engaging. When the first ship left the port, there were men on deck agasint the rails but behind them there was plenty of room on that empty deck. They could've at least got that right with all the extras. Not very convincing when you tell the men you cant take anymore cause its a full but but then theres extra space. Not a bad movie, but not great compared his other films or other gritty war films.

The pace was great and the movie were chop into pieces like Nolan likes to do; action, character, action, character, finale. I'm not saying that as a Nolan fanboy because The Dark Knight rises was phoned in and let's not talk about his convoluted mess The Prestige. I had tears in my eyes as the soldier read Churchill's speech. I bet you watch a Ken Burns documentary and complain because there's too much talking. I think this movie was probably a little too cerebral for you. If some have the same assessment then  maybe you guys should stick to Michael Bay, his movie are easily understood by five year olds.

I watched the movie. While I could appreciate the art since I studied making films long ago I did not enjoy it as much. It was not entertaining. But I don't think I agree as to why it was not. It did not need character building. I don't think that was the problem. It was lack of interesting action sequences and too much repetition of interesting ones which kills the effect of the whole scenario. Also this movie needed more scenes. Too short.

There is no need to 'have a backstory' for them as (like i said earlier knowledge on the event is useful) you'll know that they are young men that have been thrown into a war that they had no part in starting and have the chance to go home (which is ever so close) and they'll start to lose their humanity/insanity when they start getting desperate to survive.

His movies just don't have a lot of heart.

It would be nice to get his take on why he thinks the director intentionally made a decision to go the way he doesn't like. For example, he brings up the fact that Nolan did not include a lot of dialogue and as a result, it is hard to connect with any of the characters because you didn't know anything about them. As the reviewer says, this is important to a film. Thus, we can deduce that Nolan must have made a decision not to do this for some reason.

Dunkirk is about honor (or in some cases a lack of it), duty, patriotism, and survival and the characters exist just enough to explore those themes. You learn basically just their fears and desires, and they are funneled through the themes.

I liked the movie a lot. It really puts you in the moment, and it does a great job of showing the horrors of war while still staying somewhat optimistic (unlike most war movies). I think the ending really demonstrates this. We get the whole Churchill speech about sacrifice, and then we see the face of a soldier who has sacrificed. It does an incredible job of showing just what ""sacrifice"" actually entails, *without undercutting Churchill's point about the necessity of sacrifice*. In this way the movie both shows just how much these soldiers went through, and yet also says just how important the values they fought for truly were. It makes a mountain of their sacrifice, and deservedly so, but then puts the mountain up against the importance of defending freedom and home and shows that the sacrifice is always worth it. I would say my only complaint is that the movie gets somewhat repetitive, and despite putting our characters in great danger, they rarely actually die. This sort of takes away from the fear factor by the end, because it feels like the characters have a plot armor that they didn't have earlier in the film. Still, Dunkirk is a classic and skyrockets to upper tier of Nolan movies.",none,,2021-03-08 16:29:59.223177,0

Tom Hardy played Tom Hardy well, considering his limitations in the cockpit (the cinematic style photography used here was very well shot, giving us a Instagram-colour filter or something with the hazy camera movement for added effect) All in all, it's enjoyable but nowhere near the brutal impact of the beach front scenes of saving private Ryan.",none,,2021-03-08 16:29:59.223219,0

I feel like Nolan was trying (successfully) to make the audience care for each and every one of the men on the beach. He needed to have some form of ""main characters"" to be in the story so that we can see the events unfold from the direct perspective of all of the soldiers. Usually in war films (I'll use saving private Ryan as an example) the plot revolves around certain soldiers (like Cpt. Miller and Ryan) being in a war and doing things in the war but its still about THEM not THE WAR as much. In my opinion Dunkirk is a telling the STORY OF DUNKIRK. Not of Harry Style's character or Tom Hardy's character but of Dunkirk. What any of the ""main characters"" felt, every other soldier felt. Nolan resorted more to film-making techniques to tell the story rather than dialogue and that is why some people might have had a problem with the lack of character depth but realistically this type of terrible event wouldn't be a place for someone to ""develop"" as a character but rather an event where MEN WANTED ONLY SURVIVAL, and Nolan showed that perfectly.",none,,2021-03-08 16:29:59.655831,0

The music conveys that along with the choreography, and not least of all, the characters. this is exactly what it would be like for a soldier trapped in a war situation, as i have a brother in the army, i can kinda empathize with that.       
The other thing going was the enemy is un-seeable, you can feel the enemy's presence from all over. The POV is of the allied soldiers, and Christopher Nolan does a great job in exploring that side.      
However, the whole thing was a bit underwhelming, as i was expecting 'more', as in more horrors of war, more threat from the enemy.

I do believe some build up should existed. And for the record you were given some hints in the movie. And not tiny ones. #1 The Mole: One Week. #2 The Seas: One Day. #3 The Air: One Hour. 

I personally liked the movie. and you haven't been exposed enough to this kind of movie Jeremy. I dont need validation. I honestly came for your opinion. But was just so surprised by how basic you kept your review. because it feels like you missed certain key aspects about the movie. There are movies like Metropolis and such. But to be fair what movie were you expecting out of Dunkirk? 

not even the trailers could agree on a singular protagonist. I do agree there were a few too many dark hair soldiers and in the midst of battle it cam be confusion. But the main characters stood out. And I don't need their names or backstory to care about there sotuation. silence can be a valid way of pushing the story forward.

My take on the movie is that these characters are in this situation that's so intense and desperate they don't have time to fuck around and talk about their wifes or talk about how when they get home they are going to eat a hotdog from the local deli. Who has time for that shit in a war. Maybe hacksaw ridge and saving private Ryan did that but why does that have to be the standard. Why can't a film be different by not having the standard Hollywood flick cliches. Now someone might say... ok well the movie needs character development.... and I say THERE IS. It's not just thrown at your face because the director thinks your a five year old. The movie conveys that actions speak louder than words. There are many moments in the film that makes the audience assess their thoughts on a character.  I respect Jeremy's opinion but I just feel strongly different about it and I think many other peoples do too.,none,,2021-03-08 16:30:00.094885,0

I just feel he was not paying attention to the film at all. He explains that he couldn't grab onto any of the characters because he doesn't learn anything about them and what they're fighting for, but in the movie it clearly explains that if this evacuation fails then it would be the end of Britain entirely, and the world. They're fighting for the future of their entire country, and for the future of the planet. The film is titled 'Dunkirk.' From that, and the fact there is very little character development, it's easy to understand that the film is not about a small group of people in Dunkirk trying to survive, but the entire Dunkirk event itself. None of the protagonists have time to stop, talk, and create a little bit of development for their character because absolutely everyone is in *survival* mode. No one wants to talk, they want to survive. The battle doesn't stop for them, and no one has the time or mindset to stop themselves.

Also, it explains in the very beginning that the film is told in 3 stories set over periods of 1 hour, 1 day, and 1 week. Did he not see that?

It's cool that you didn't like this film, Jeremy. It's very different to most films, and completely different to any war film I've ever seen, and if you don't like 'different', that's perfectly okay. You're not 'weird', different, or edgy for not liking a Nolan film, you just have an opinion like everyone else.

There's the one that likes to have every leaf on every tree described in full detail, and there are readers who would much rather have that detail poured into the characters. That's the difference between a Book that World builds and a book that's driven by characters. Apply that logic to Dunkirk. It was put together really well but it's whether or not the movie watcher likes the style it took. I personally like that there was no dialogue, it gave more room for events to happen and I still cared about the characters, but other people would like to see character arcs and growth.

I revisit movies for Coppola's ""I love the smell of napalm in the morning"" scene or when Willem Dafoe raised his arms to the sky in Platoon to symbolize his crucification. The emotional and intellectual power of those movies will stay with me. I don't think Dunkirk will.

But leaving the theatre there was something about it that didn't quite connect with me. I realized it was the characters.  I can totally appreciate the history behind this incredible story of sacrifice and survival. But the characters were rather bland. I couldn't name a single character besides ""George"" and thats only because the blonde kid kept yelling out his name. There was no important dialogue whatsoever. If people weren't almost drowning, they were just staring off into the horizon. Sure, that projects a certain amount of emotion to the situation, but this is a movie, and a movie can only be as good as the characters you focus on. Mark Rylance's character was by far the best, and that's only because he had the most dialogue (Tom Hardy's character was pretty dope too, but because of his actions). Chris Nolan loves to use this certain sound in his films during scenes of hightened anxiety, basically it sounds like 2 violins scratching together. That sound seems to go through the entire movie, which by the end made me numb to what it is supposed to project. 

Again, the STORY of Dunkirk is incredible. The VISUALS of this film were amazing, escecially in IMAX. But just about everything else just didn't quite do it for me.",none,,2021-03-08 16:30:00.994084,0

They actually had time to take a fucking breather and talk as friends. In Dunkirk u don't. I've seen this movie twice now and yes I'll admit it's characterisation I was originally conflicted by and I didn't know how I felt. Re watching it, I realised that actions speak louder than words. The actions of the characters are what gave them character and what made my heart race and gave tension and made me care for them to survive. Why? Cause of every action they take cause with even a slip of the finger could be the difference between life or death and this is something that Nolan captivated beautifully. Jeremy, by all means I am definitely not discriminating your view in the movie what so ever Cause reviews and film analysis is all a matter of opinion. But my view after seeing it a second time is that the actions of each character, George, Tommy, Alex, there actions spoke louder then there words and that's what I loved most about Dunkirk and if u do get the opportunity to see it for a second time, hopefully u can also get the same result out of that aspect as I did.",none,,2021-03-08 16:30:00.994251,0

I mean, I loved the movie, and that despite the fact that I expect great characters, and great character development, contrast between different characters etc. when it comes to a Nolan movie. I was really surprised that I liked it even then. But what's wrong about giving his opinion? So he didn't enjoy the movie, that's fine, not everyone has too. He explained his opinion, he didn't just throw stupid catchphrases like it being overrated, he explained why he didn't enjoy it as much, and that's fine.

So don't be a fanboy. Like it because it's great, not because it's Nolan, because it is great. And don't like it if it wasn't for you, that's fine, you can still enjoy all the other Nolan movies. I personally enjoyed it, despite thinking that it would not be my type of movie, being a WWII setting, being a true story, and the focus on the event instead of the characters.

First it was Intersteller. Now Dunkirk. What is with everybody and Chris Nolan. I don't get why he's so beloved. Yes, I saw DarkKnight, and know he's a good film dictator, but he's not God. His dialog always ends up not human. He's trying to treat it like it's some damn novel, which it fuckin isn't it. ""You just don't get!"" ""You just don't get what Nolan's vision is."" I know what it is: he's a man who loves to prove a point or simply tries to make his character's smart but they end up pulling the most unrealistic shit. Why was Clark's father just standing there at that damn truck? Because it's the Noble choice, despite Superman having super powers at that point. 

Why pick on Jeremy for being human? Last time I check Nolan wasn't Jesus Christ. He's a fucking film director. I just want to kick his 'perfect' nuts, just to show he's human.

Nolan is telling a war story in a different and unique way immersing the viewer in the chaos and peril of the situation and not necessarily following the' hero' from start to finish as we always see. People will react differently in such awful conditions, in Dunkirk you never know what to expect from the characters , which to me gives it a sense of realism. The character development is in their actions and reactions not in rousing speeches and stories from home. Nolan has left his mark on the war genre, I'm not saying this is the best war movie ever, but I do think this is a classic and only Christopher Nolan could have told the story this way and pulled it off.",none,,2021-03-08 16:30:00.995078,0

In order to care, we need to know that there are stakes involved over and above the mere fact that a human being with a personality, consciousness, self-awareness and social/family circle, no doubt much like our own, might be murdered suddenly and gruesomely at any  moment. I use the word murdered because war is merely politically sanctioned mass murder at the end of the day and I am of the opinion that it's a sad thing that we need something more than just the prospect of the pointless deaths of humans to motivate us to give a damn about those characters involved. Why do we need to know the specifics of these men's lives? Any one of them could have been you. Imagining yourself in that situation should be enough to make you care about the horrors that were involved without the need for a fleshed-out character with whom to relate. IMO. Having said all that, I get that you're critiquing this movie as a MOVIE, in which certain expectations such as character development are completely justified, so I also think that your opinion thereof is, of course, absolutely valid. I just suspect that the film-maker's intention went beyond making a conventional movie that fulfilled those expectations.",none,,2021-03-08 16:30:01.411559,0

But Nolan could have easily developed these characters in more creative ways. For instance. The two ""main"" characters you meet at the beginning of the film meet each other for the first time and stick by each other... but never say a single word to each other for about 50 minutes of the film. That's not realistic. People talk. That's why people have mouths. So I agree with Jeremy. Nolan didn't develop these characters enough so I didn't care about them. And the battle scenes weren't nearly tense enough when compared to films like saving private ryan where, despite me not knowing the people who died during D-day in the opening scene, I could really feel their fear and peril because everything was so gruesome and relentless.

The lack of dialogue is part of the answer to that question, you wouldn't stand around talking to people pretending everything's alright, these people were beyond terrified and shell-shocked. They didn't have the energy or luxury to talk and war movies that pretend people do in such situations can be great movies but they ultimately fail to depict this particular part of war, the soul-draining and life killing aspect of waiting somewhere surrounded by enemies. The simple relationship that begins between the two soldiers who try to get on board the ship by carrying a stretcher together tells more about the situation because they don't say anything to each other than if they did; they've all lost their best friends already and they're not too keen on making anymore they can lose, when you watch your troop die you don't run up to the next person and say, ""hey what's your name?! I'm Jeffrey."" To have dialogue rich scenes would have broken the cinematic net Nolan was using to catch and reel in the viewer, it would have given them too much emotional comfort and the effect of suspense would have been lost. 

The movie is about the ""urgency"" of survival and ultimately that urgency is relieved by the British citizens. Nolan accomplishes what he set out to do: put the viewers as best he can in the emotional seat of the British soldier stuck on Dunkirk. Criticizing Nolan for not spewing out emotional backstory is like criticizing a comedy for being to funny or a drama for being to dramatic. The previews and build up to this movie gave you no illusion about what this movie would be, it promised you heart-pounding spectacle and suspense and it delivered on that promise in the most epic of ways. When you order coffee and you get great coffee you don't critique the barista for not giving you hot chocolate, you ordered coffee dammit, what'd you expect?.",none,,2021-03-08 16:30:01.991253,0

It's to show how the situation of Dunkirk made the soldiers feel and therefore, how it makes you feel while watching it. Even the somewhat 'main' character was called 'tommy' because it was name given to the average normal soldiers and it shows that he wasn't supposed to be the lovable character that the audience routes for, but a representation of what the average, young, normal soldier would have experienced as a result of that situation. I respect your review but i just personally think a film doesn't need a massive amount of dialogue to make a movie good or enjoyable or to make you feel sympathy for the characters just because you don't necessarily know who they are/what they're like. This movie was one of the most stressful things i've ever watched and in my opinion and i personally think it benefited from the lack of dialogue as it allowed you to feel more engaged with their situation and the constant bombardment of danger.",none,,2021-03-08 16:30:02.375055,0

It's different, not typical to every other film. I loved that idea for two reasons: 1) it really helped you to get into the atmosphere of being in there. If you were a soldier at Dunkirk you probably won't know anything about the other soldiers and frankly wouldn't care about their past etc. It showed more the human nature. 2) I personally cared about the characters, altought I have to admit I don't remember all their names. But I loved the fact I cared about them not even knowing anything about their lifes. You basically cared about them just because they are people. Doesn't matter if they have wife, killed someone etc. but it matters that they are human beings. Men in danger. Men whom can lose their lifes. This film made you care about human life not just about one character because he has wife and a kid. That's very typical for hollywood films. To make you care about characters just because you know their family status etc. But this movie made me care even without this things.

I have to say I'm a bit disappointed in the movie because usually I'm looking for that mind blowing ending moment that he usually includes like in Memento or The Prestige. I'm glad I saw Jeremy's review before entering the movie, because it seems Nolan was trying to go for a tribute/documentary type film. And if you look at the movie from that sense, as being a realistic war film about that specific evacuation... then I have to say it's pretty enjoyable.

That moment when Tom Hardy's character saves the dock from the German Plane even when he has no fuel caught everyone by surprise, it was pure gold. Everyone was so conditioned to believe that something horrible was about to happen just as it had been for the whole movie. It's kind of that rare feeling of relief you get in life when something surprisingly fortunate happens, because usually it never comes. For that moment alone I have to give Nolan props.

But all in all, it's far from his best work... still enjoyable though if you know what you're getting into. And now I know of Dunkirk. Time to geek out and look at YouTube documentaries on the event.

It isn't a documentary, but a live action film reenactment. Not everyone will be interested in that, especially if they didn't know what they were getting into.

I was wondering where my people were. The visuals are fantastic, I appreciated all of the practical effects and enormous amounts of extras, in the beginning you know he's not messing around. The problem comes in the middle when visuals over saturates your senses- so much blue with sky and sea. It reminded me of slide shows where they show the same thing but from different perspectives. The music composition is of high quality although its used too much. The whole thing felt like an old man's baroquian music video. I can deal with the lack of characterization since the character itself is that moment in time. Its hard for war movies to pull that off since the shock of seeing people dying sort of loses its power after the first few times and then you become numb to the whole experience.

Sure, it's a war film, and we don't have to know about the characters, just what they do is enough, but when you swap back and forth between several characters we don't know much it seems kind off confusing. The soldier on the beach arc and the civilian boat arc both suffer from this. The glaring example being the kid who tags along who ends up getting fatally injured by the shellshocked soldier. You could cut him out of the movie with zero consequences, and that's because we barely know anything about him to care for him, the focus instead goes to the soldiers on the beach or the pilots.

The only 'main character' I really cared for is the pilot Ferrier played by Tom Hardy, and his wingman. The whole 'Air' plot of the film is the most well-done in my opinion. That's because his arc take place in a short time span. Even with the numerous cuts, I can still tell what's going on in his arc. Really, I feel like the movie could've just focus on any of the three arcs in full instead of trying to play them all together.

I agree with Jeremy with the character development, but it wasn't due to a lack of dialogue, but rather the structure of the storytelling. Jeremy talks about the importance of character development because it creates EMPATHY, and strong empathy correlates to strong emotional responses. In the film, I felt the most empathy towards Fionn, the silent French guy, and Harry's characters. Not much dialogue between the three but they endure the situations together, enhanced by the AMAZING sound and Hans' pacing score.

On the flip side, I barely felt any empathy towards Barry Keoghan's character. His event showed well the effects of shell shock and accidents of war, but it did not change the course of actions of Cilian Murphy's character, nor Rylance or Tom Carney's characters. He had a place in the story, but the amount of screen time he got didn't create any more empathy. Maybe Chris put it in based off of a real story, I'm not sure. I really wanted to see more of Cilian Murphy's character. Maybe Chris should've had a moment where Murphy see's that he killed the boy, and his REACTION to that would've sparked empathy.

On a new topic, as much as I love non-linear storytelling, this is the one Nolan film I actually disagreed with it; most of his non-linearness serves a purpose to the story, such as Cobb waking up on the beach in limbo, but in Dunkirk, maybe three small moments does the disjointed story line serve a purpose, such as Fionn helping to bury the soldier. But most of the time, it actually hinders the story by its confusion. Even if the viewer is able to piece it together, it doesn't make the story better or serve much purpose. I felt like Nolan maybe thought keeping some parts of it linear wouldn't keep viewers' attentions as much, and deliberately mixed it. I've agreed with all of Nolan's prior non-linear storylines, but for Dunkirk I only agreed with a little bit of it - thinking it took more away from the story than enhancing it.

Lastly, I want to discuss the rhythm. This film has sequences of high pace, and many times its freaking sweet with the storyline. In my opinion though, there were too many times Chris built up great energy and then immediately killed it, and other times he misplaced Hans' score.

What the film excelled in: its cinematography, score, sounds, directing, production designing, and acting. I truly believe with proper re-editing this film could've been pieced together better, making it GREAT, something I even wish Chris would consider before a DVD release. Overall I'd have to rank it on the lower end of Nolan's best films because of the writing, all of which his other films had over this one.

It deliberately keeps things vague, you never really know what side the pilots are on until well into the movie, you wonder are these soldiers on the same side as the air force. That ambiguity leads to a narrative that makes you question war itself. This is emphasised in the final scene where (Harry Styles?) says they failed, but he finds a cheering crowd on the platform as if they are war heroes. It makes you question the point of war.. Having said that, I still don't think it's a great movie. There's nothing to hold on to. This could be a great short film I'd be happy to watching as a thought experiment. A movie the scale & ambition as it has been positioned to be, it just falls very short of really doing anything. Nothing really happens.

I shouldn't have to do that. If you're going to have me figure things out at least develop a technique or a visual marker to have me follow the time jumps.

A movie is based off of tragic, real life events and critics hail it for being historically accurate and many consider it a great movie. I respect the real life events and lives, but it doesn't mean that real life events always make for a good movie. It is a dangerous ground to stand on as a filmmaker because people can become upset at films such as Titanic for using real life tragedy as a plot device. Other examples being ""Pearl Harbor"" by Michael Bay. That said this movie had some really cool effects at times and techniques of visual story- telling. It had suspense throughout, but Jeremy is right it lacked character. I kept wondering why the main hero was the main star and although I liked him I still am not sure, maybe to show how all men were apart of this event especially the ordinary and average. I think I'll make a video essay about this film this week.

The events that all these men go through do not leave room for conversations of nearly any kind and thats very realistic if you think about how you would feel after almost dying multiple times in a span of a couple hours with the enemy still hunting you down. They are also being attacked the entire film and that is what Nolan wanted; he wanted a film about the Dunkirk evacuation not necessarily how each characters lives and how they all got there. Instead Nolan choose to highlight that war itself is gruesome and harrowing in its own right, not just because we see some characters die a dramatic tear filled death.

The point of the land characters: survival. The point of the sea characters: doing your duty as a citizen. The point of the air characters: fighting for your country.

A lot of people draw parallels to Chris Stuckman's review, for he understood that while the movie lacked slightly in character, the characters were not the point of the story. I don't know about you, but I didn't necessarily care about the relatives or wives of the main characters. No, I was more focused on the 400,000 soldiers trying to escape an unstoppable Nazi force. The drowning scenes made me fearful, and the sounds absolutely terrified me, which you agree with. The gunshots sounded like they were real, the planes put a pit in my stomach each time their engines could be heard, and the fast paced soundtrack in the background never made for a dull moment. The brief pauses between sounds were filled with suspense, and thrill as the scene continued. The sheer scale of the film itself should make it clear that this is not the story of a boy and his friends who survived a war, it's a story about the brave soldiers and citizens who risked life and limb, and epic tale of sacrifice and heroism. And if you will sit there and tell me you needed a scene where they laughed, toasting marshmallows and sharing stories of back home in the middle of this horrific event, you've got the wrong film.

However, I feel like the absence of dialogue really forced you to look into other areas of the character and learn about them by looking through their eyes and observing how they react to the unfortunate situation they are thrust into. This is war and each character is too out of breath to sit down and talk about their moms back at home -- in fact, they're barely given time to. You are left to presume as much on your own as the movie gives you. I found this to be a crucial part of the film. Because, really, the background characters mattered just as much as the main ones, as you do not distinguish one as being more important than the other. Of course, the main characters get more screen time and you are left to care about them deeper than the minor ones, but in the end, they were all just terrified boys trying to get off of a beach, surrounded on all sides by certain death.",none,,2021-03-08 16:30:03.493267,0

The art here is that Nolan could do it for his audience without using any of the elements used before, such as character history, etc. because they don't have to be anyone specia! The fact that they're people is enough, and no one, NO ONE deserves to go through what they went through. It seems simple enough fact, but we just keep forgetting it.

Many reviewers like yourself acknowledge that Nolan's vision puts you onto the beach with the soldiers as if you are one of them. There are 400,000 soldiers. Tell me... does Tommy (Whitehead) know all of the men that are on that beach? Does he know any of them? Did Dawson (Rylance) know him? Did Dawson know any of the soldiers on that beach, or the shivering soldier (Murphy), or the pilot he rescued despite the fact no chute deployed?

What you don't realize is that these men call each other brothers. They don't have to be related and they don't have to be acquaintances. They just have to have a common goal, and that they did. Why was Tommy defending Gibson (French soldier) inside of the boat when he never even said a word to the guy? Maybe it's because Gibson offered Tommy water; maybe it's because Gibson saved Tommy's life when he was drowning. Why did Gibson do those things? He has no reason to, except for the fact that he cared. Why did he care? Like Tommy, Gibson was simply trying to survive.

We as audience members are also soldiers on that beach; providing some anonymity in their wake allows us to insert our personalities, backgrounds, and aspirations into their lives. We are holding our breaths, covering our ears, and want to reach into the screen and hang on to one of the people there so they aren't overtaken by the enemy forces. They would die for their fellow comrades, and they will do it without a second's hesitation. No learning names, no delivering messages, no earning trust. Time was against them and they acted on it, all because they cared. 

If you as an audience member are unable to care about these people because they didn't mention their daughter and their cat, and you can't see the point as to why they can care without knowing those instances, then Nolan failed to captivate you the way that he intended, and you missed the mark on what he attempted to convey for you. To quote Scarlett Johansson in The Prestige: ""It's inhuman to be so cold.""

And I said all of this without ever once mentioning Bolton (Branagh), Farrier (Hardy), or every other civilian who came to rescue those men. This film is about communal heroism; if you're looking for something else, Hacksaw Ridge is available at the local Walgreens Redbox.",none,,2021-03-08 16:30:03.494038,12

I love history (particularly WW2) so I loved witnessing the reality that Nolan brought forward or at least as real as we can try. Things like witnessing the Spitfires dogfight (which were real WW2 spitfires used btw) and hearing their engines purr made me lose my shit, because everyone talks about the visuals, but THE SOUND in the movie holy shit, the music is ridiculously intense and the effects feel real, when a bullet is shot you can feel it, it is deafening. As far as the characters go, firstly, I feel as though the fact that they didnt speak too much was brilliant, because it adds to the suspense of it all and makes you feel like a participant, you arent being spoonfed information, nor do you feel too comfortable in company, youre having to work out what is happening as if you are going through this with the soldiers. Secondly their relative silence and ""just a bunch of random white dudes""ness allows the main characters stories to be told in a personal and intimate manner through their actions and body positioning, but also allows them to be vague enough that they seem to represent the struggle of the entire 400,000 men. i.e. We only witness 2 RAF pilots fighting, and we connect with them through their courage and dialogue, and obviously there were more pilots involved in the battle, but thats the beauty of it, we automatically assume that all pilots that fought through this battle were just as couragous and committed to helping their fellow countrymen. This film I feel is a deeply intimate (even more so than it would be with dialogue I feel) homage to all soldiers that fought in WW2 that is shown to us in bitesize representations so as to not get lost with pointless dialogue and an overcrowded cast, and focus on the pure despair that was overcome by the brave acts of so many men and women, at the bleakest point in WW2.",none,,2021-03-08 16:30:03.996268,0

I think a lot of people will like this film, initially. The problem however as Jeremy says there's not the usual level of characterization that Nolan normally brings to his films. You don't know anything about the people who are drowning, so after a while you're just left thinking ""Okay, another drowning scene, and another, and another"". I was surprised at how little details were mentioned about the characters. I don't even know who the main character is supposed to be neither, really. 

It was stunning though, the sound was incredible. I'd absolutely recommend going to watch it if you haven't already but I don't think this will be a rewatchable Nolan classic like Inception or Interstellar.

He doesn't have a shred of maliciousness in him, he isn't rude about his points, but he isn't a bitch either.

His GTAV review is a good example of his ethic, i absolutely loved that review.

He articulates his points well without it being a 20minute snore fest. He doesn't come across as though he's pretending to be a writing genius who knows everything, he's just a guy.

When you sit in a event like this, you do not sit around a fire and talk about your family and why do you want to get off the beach. You are more focused on getting a plan of action to get off the beach.

Since when is it a requirement to make a good movie?
I really do not understand it, so please explain that to me, why do you need character development in every movie?

Why not just watch the movie and see how the event unfolds and then judge the movie on the events and how things happened.

I am not hating you but I just want to understand that every time a movie is not that great for you it is mostly because of character development or you need an attachment to justify it as a great movie.",none,,2021-03-08 16:30:04.437415,0

I personally value Jeremy's true analysis of the movie in that he said if you enjoy realism and visuals you will find this movie entertaining, but if you value characters this movie may not be for you. 

Personally, I am like Jeremy in that I love character driven movies, and as a history and English major I don't feel bad saying I like my historic films to be character based. Yes in the moment of a war zone it is unrealistic for characters to spew their life story, but you could always use flashbacks to show the audience, as Jeremy said, why they want to live and what they're fighting to stay alive for. Because here's the thing about war in actual history: every soldier, every nurse, every prisoner of war, etc had a backstory and had something to stay alive for. When films and books pick up an individual's life to me it feels accurate because we are acknowledging the reality that soldiers are more than just numbers and letters on a dog tag. In making this movie, Nolan went for a different type of realism which concentrates more on just the task at hand, and while there is nothing wrong with that, no one needs to get their panties in a bunch because a few people, like Jeremy and myself, would enjoy the story more if we knew more about the people on screen. You are not wrong for disliking the movie because of the lack of character, and you are not wrong for liking the movie for its in-the-moment approach. People can have preferences and that is not a bad thing.",none,,2021-03-08 16:30:04.438651,0

I would never go into watching this film for individuals because the glamor of Dunkirk is about how critical it was to World War 2. The people of Dunkirk were individually worthless it was more the possibility of the Nazis killing off the remainder of the French army and the British Expeditionary Force. Dunkirk movie is about the battle, not the people. If you don't want that this movie wouldn't be for you, it really depends on what you want so really Rotten Tomatoes is probably praising it as a movie for a battle and not a movie for character essentially leaving both of their critiques right.

However this being based on a true even and (probably) Nolan wanted to capture the reality of war for a change (unlike Saving Pvt Ryan or any war movie that is over romanticized) is daring.

Why should you care for these boys, is simple. They are soldiers in a foreign country trying to save it for the 2nd time in 20 years and being pushed literally to the edge. Losing these lads meant losing the war! Plain and simple.

Adolf first and probably biggest mistake was not to hunt down these lads on the beaches. If he'd send in the panzer divisions on the beaches most of these lads that were saved gave Adolf/Rommel a crucial defeat in El Alamein.

This movie was great,,,that movie was amazing but they both have problems.....

Same as every war\based on true events film.....Pearl harbour and Titanic are the best examples of tipping the scale for more character development rather than the event it was meant to be about....still good films at heart but kind of over shadowed by the fake characters put in for plot devices...

Jeremey also should have pointed out though, to help his opinion....THIS IS A MOVIE, NOT A DOCUMENTARY....therefore it can be accurate (Nolan has a keen eye for this) but also has to have something that drives the audience to care for the people on screen that you know are actors.....

best example of pulling this off is *American Sniper* based on true events but at its heart,,,based on a real, amazing soilder....which is why big events on screen like this feel muddled and alittle convoluted, there's not one but many individuals who help the cause yet you can't gove favour for one mans story because it really is not just about him..

Again though, a fantastic film..
Expertly shot and recreated...

I am looking forward to seeing this on the IMAX screen to experience the spectacle. I don't think I will leave the theatre disappointed regarding that aspect.. however...

Nolan is by far the most overrated director working today. His last 2 films have been poor. TDKR was a mess, and while interstellar had some amazing visuals it again was a mess, the sound mix particularly in that movie was horrific. 

Chris is without doubt an extremely talented film maker and still one of the best directors out there (and no I'm not contradicting myself) he just has FAR TOO many fanboys (professionals and amateurs) that if he filmed himself taking a shit those individuals would still rave about it... 

Dunkirk is already overrated because of the Nolan effect. Walking into Inception and Interstellar you genuinely thought you were about to experience the second coming, after ridiculously positive reviews, after the movie you were left underwhelmed solely because of the critique hype going into it. They were not nearly as good as was suggested. I feel this is exactly what will happen when I see Dunkirk.

That's why I like it so much. Being someone that evidently doesn't know much about this part of the war, you've probably been missing out on this experience.
 I'd also add that it's likely a movie aimed at the British public (who all know the backstory) rather than Americans. It is a British movie after all.",none,,2021-03-08 16:30:05.283432,0

I think he kind of missed the point about the lack of characters. Dunkirk was a historical event that happened to real people. It doesn't have to be narrowed down to a character story because the event itself is supposed to be the character; if you personally need a strong set of protagonists in a movie to relate to & care about the story rather than just realize that the story is affecting this large group of people then that is fair, but it is not necessary to tell the story & impact of the event itself. 

Just imagine if they make another movie about 9/11; if you're old enough to remember the event, you realize how it effected everyone that went through it as a whole. We saw it happen to the people of New York (Americans in general), we didn't need to see it through the eyes of a set of few characters.

I love only two of his movies (inception and dark knight).
The others are waving between ok (ex: begins, insomnia...) to MEH-ish (Interstellar, memento,...)
He is a good script writer, but an ok director. He films everything the way it's supposed to (shot-countershot in conversation, very close shot for important objects, wide shot to introduce scenes, etc.)
Some may says he plays a lot with a fracture narration, and so with editing. But really, this is also the way he writes that forces this editing work; and his quest of playing with the truth of what we see. Once you understand how he writes/directs, you can predict where he is leading you; that's what happened for me in Interstellar; too predictable (ps: that's not the only reason i don't like this movie.)
And sometimes, when he plays to much with editing, the story make no real sense at the end (watch memento in the real order, there are so many problems).
I have no hype at all for Dunkirk, but will surely see it; and i don't want to offend those who adore him, just posting my opinion on the guy.",none,,2021-03-08 16:30:05.706730,11

Or maybe it's just the way he edits his videos! I really feel he has missed out on enjoying what could be the greatest war movie of all time. The need for character backgrounds completely contradicts the scenario of war itself. As someone who was not present in either of the world wars I feel I can intelligently understand that it would be intensely confusing and agonisingly depressing that even the hint of WHY someone needed to get back home, WHY someone had to be reunited with his friends and WHY someone had to relate to every audience member would be so overshadowed by the other 400,000 mens personal thoughts and feelings. A character driven plot would simply be tears in rain here. This was an event on a mass scale, where many many people died for the most important reason or perhaps no reason at all..... Simply put, War is horrific! This Masterpiece of a film gives me the most immersive experience of the fear, confusion and scale or war. There are plenty or overly glamourized romantic war movies for you to follow your hero all the way home and them some out there... This is a glimpse of something we are lucky enough to be given and should treat it with such respect and therefore give our thoughts to the many that fought and died in that time for us to have the freedom we do today.Although I completely disagree with Jeremy's opinion of the film, it is of course HIS opinion ;) I just feel sad that the extremely small minority are not experiencing the film in the way it was intended.

I'm going to see it, but those seem to be really valid opionions. Don't know why people are freaking out. I just go back to the reasons why I watch a movie--it's not necessarily for the ""entertainment"" factor, but rather for the ""experiential"" factor and that is what can introduce my mind to a different perspective(s) than I might have held. For me, I think Dunkirk will be more in that vein and so I won't be disappointed. 

I just think that there are too many tired tropes about war movies that worship the people on a side with the ""sad soldier backstory"" that it's emotional manipulation on the audience, when in reality it shouldn't be that you have to hear someone's back-home tragedy to care about their life; you should just feel for them equally in the trial they're currently going through.

I hated his take on Batman and thought that other movie about the dream, forget the name, it was Meh... I think I had a problem with the ending. Yeah didn't like the top.  But yeah, Dunkirk seemed like a bad idea for a movie. A war movie in the middle of August should mean blockbuster movie. Dunkirk is not a Blockbuster story unless Nolan planned to throw in some Aliens and giant Robots. Dunkirk is a shot at movie Awards so it should have been released at the end of the year but it couldn't because no one would see it with heroes and Jedi running around. But it is going to get killed in the late August by spidermen and talking apes. There was no good time to release this movie except maybe the first half of the year. Either way, it's a War movie without America. So only hardcore war junkies will see it. Young kids and most women will skip it. I said this back when I saw the trailer and nothing has changed. This movie was a bad idea for Nolan after the shit Interstellar turned out to be.  He better have signed the paper work on Bond or he's fucked.",none,,2021-03-08 16:30:06.629448,0

Stories are superfluous - this isn't about ONE man, it's about the nature of a specific aspect of war.  There wasn't that type of my-wife-back-home, character building storytelling because this event took place across a much shorter time frame than allows for that. The peril was extremely immediate. You have that conversation in many other war films because they cover an event with a time span and urgency that allowed for that type of talk in real life. Here, the situation was hugely overbearing in terms of time sensitivity so it was harrowing on a level that precluded casual newborn baby daughter type talk. To have done so would've been artificial, insincere and false - people weren't bothered, they were focused on staying alive. He stays true to that and it's a better film for it - more real and raw, visceral. You can't shoehorn that in here, it's a far better film for not re-treading that trope that there's already plenty of in other war films. This is more genuine. It's better BECAUSE it's that realistic, not worse. Want that? Watch Apocalypse Now. This is for those who want the event to be the centrepiece as it was in real life, not Jack and his Dorris back home. It was an intentional move to stay true to the event and let its disaster speak for the men. Conversation couldn't BRING security at that point, so Nolan didn't try to claim it could; further, no-one was in the mood for that shit, unsurprisingly. So why force it? He was showing that this event and the era as a whole was bigger than any one man or two men - his lack of this type of conversation symbolised that.",none,,2021-03-08 16:30:07.027141,0

So this little moment of history where us tea drinking cricket loving Englishmen, help rescue such a large portion of the Armies of The British Empire France Poland and whoome else ever. was as important as any other point am probably more so, in the fight against the whole world talking Germany.
So while you americans sat on your asses thinking If I put my hands over my ears and go La la la la very loud, the war will not come here, thousands of British small boat owners risked their lives, just because their lives might mean we get to fight another day. The american line of we came and saved your skin, is such a fallacy, we saved your asses by fighting with every boat and every small ship we could find so we could fight another day. 
One day I will watch a movie where the americans are the heroes of Dunkirk, well you keep stealing our history.",none,,2021-03-08 16:30:07.816313,0

I think it's important for people to judge a film on what it is TRYING to do, not what they didn't do (I hope that makes sense.) It's clear that the characters having no backstory and being borderline nameless is the point the film was trying to make. Now whether that fails is subjective but characters not having backstories is not (or shouldn't be) a criticism because that's not what the film was trying to do. 

I'm not a Nolan fanboy and I'm not even mad but this review just made me realise that if you judge a film on what it doesn't do rather than what it is trying to do, you'll always be disappointed. This isn't to say that this review is invalid -- it isn't -- but that saying ""this film didn't do x"" when the film was clearly not trying to do that just strikes me as kind of weird.",none,,2021-03-08 16:30:08.233689,0

There isn't really any main character, YOU are the main character, the film immerses you and throws you into the middle of the war, the characters in the film, their reactions and actions are are basically conveying what you would do and that is why Chris Nolan described it as VR without the goggles. What Jeremy said in the beginning of his review was what Nolan wanted you to experience, he cited the impact of the sound of gunfire and the sound of the luftwaffe coming closer and closer and the dread of death was meant to scare you, to shock you and show you the true horrors of war. Hans Zimmer's ticking clock is signifying the enemy closing in on you. This film makes you hold your breath, it shocks you and brings you to your knees, like Rian Johnson said, Dunkirk is ""An All Timer"", nothing like it has been done before, this film is groundbreaking, Jeremy didn't really understand that this film isn't taking the clique route of normal films it's taking a whole new approach and maybe Jeremy didn't enjoy that. 10/10 Masterpiece for me.

Every time Chris Nolan drops a movie there is this instant hype. Every critic is falling head over heels about the next Nolan movie and probably feel the anxiety to get stigmatized as stupid if they would feel otherwise. As soon as you are not blindly love everything that Nolan does, there is this army of fanboys telling you that you ""just don't get it"". Don't get me wrong Nolan is one of the most talented and best directors in our time. No doubt about it. Memento and Dark Knight are masterpieces. Prestige and Inception are good movies. Batman Begins was a solid origin story, but was also lacking and not completley fullfilling. Interstellar had some moments and I like the scientific approach to it, but the story was unfocused and confusing. Dark Knight Rises is actually the worst Nolan movie in my opinion. Bane was great and the actors did a great job in general, but the plot was just overlong and chaotic. The action not well directed, the CGI partially bad and there were are lot of small details that added up and made me not appreciate this movie. I like his movies and I'll take a chance with the next Nolan movie any day, but there is nothing wrong to point out some flaws. Still curious about this movie.",none,,2021-03-08 16:30:08.760261,0

 Now, whenever I hear a movie claim such things, I just assume they are lying.   

Most recent burn was by Fly Away Home, a beautiful movie that I would enjoy if they didn't try to push it so hard as a retelling of real events.  The movie is about a girl who lost her mother, moved to a new country to be with her dad in the middle of nowhere, and developed a bond with ducks to help her cope with her loss.  She then discovers and executes a new way to teach human raised birds how to migrate.  Sounds great and super touching right? Only in the real world it wasn't a little girl who lost her mom flying ducks she raised from the egg across canada and the US (how she taught them how to migrate), it was actually some 40 year old male scientist (Edit: I don't think he was a scientist actually, but an inventor).  

At that point you are as based on reality as LOTR is based on a world war.  Your fiction, that's not a bad thing.  Just own it instead of trying to trick and manipulate me to see your movie.",none,,2021-03-08 16:30:09.705265,0

Very Anita Sarkeeisan like (in a sense). Of course this would be different if he never had a rating system, but since the core of his movie reviews are his original rating system, to see him not include it because he knows he'll get a lot of hate makes him come off a little bit like a pussy. Just own up to it, and move on.

The movie might be good at certain things but for a lot of people, we care about characters. Imagine if Star wars didn't have any major characters to care about or the Marvel movies lacked great characters. I think Jeremy's review is gonna make me wait till this movie is on blu ray to check it out, not because he didn't like it but because the way he described the movie makes it seem like something I wouldn't be interested in. When he gave a meh review to Gotg 2, I respected that he didn't enjoy the movie but still went to go see it because he described a movie that I still wanted to see. 

If anything, I only hate the rating system more than I hate his opinion. Some people get pissy about the value assigned to the movie and not the reason Jeremy enjoyed it when that's what matters. Was this movie a good time, no alcohol or good time if you're drunk? doesn't matter because, I know I won't enjoy the movie anyway.

Anyway, the film is 106 minutes and those three points of view move quickly. I don't think slow was the right word for what you were looking for. When you're ""bored"" in a film (like you said you were) things may SEEM slow to you, but if you look at the film closely you'll notice how quickly it moves, literally. I mean there is gunfire and chasing in the first scene in the movie when the infantry boy runs away from the line to the beach. There aren't really any pauses in this film.

This war movie is in the same veins as A Bridge Too Far and Battle of the Bulge.

There are three types of films - 1)  Common Denominator type films. The films you shut your brain off and just have a good time (alcohol may or may not be required). 2) Thinking Man's films. The films that you need your brain to follow along with in order to understand the plot and connect with the characters' plight (Typically the films Jeremy rates as blu-ray or awesometacular). 3) The Oscar Contenders. These are the artsy films. They fight for the gold for their in-depth look at a certain aspect of film making be it cinematography, storytelling, character development, or all the above.

Jeremy tends to enjoy the films that fall somewhere between 2 and 3. More often than not, the films that lean toward the 2nd group entertain him, as well as me. Dunkirk is an Oscar Contender through and through. Nolan has earned the trust of studios to allow him to be as experimental as he wants, and he wants the gold. What is a guaranteed way of getting the gold? *True stories*.

Perhaps I am wrong and Nolan just wants to do something artsy just to do something artsy, but the man has gotten a taste of gold in the past. Do you really think he won't *try* for it at some point?",none,,2021-03-08 16:30:11.514478,0

I love only two of his movies (inception and dark knight).
The others are waving between ok (ex: begins, insomnia...) to MEH-ish (Interstellar, memento,...)
He is a good script writer, but an ok director. He films everything the way it's supposed to (shot-countershot in conversation, very close shot for important objects, wide shot to introduce scenes, etc.)
Some may says he plays a lot with a fracture narration, and so with editing. But really, this is also the way he writes that forces this editing work; and his quest of playing with the truth of what we see. Once you understand how he writes/directs, you can predict where he is leading you; that's what happened for me in Interstellar; too predictable (ps: that's not the only reason i don't like this movie.)
And sometimes, when he plays to much with editing, the story make no real sense at the end (watch memento in the real order, there are so many problems).
I have no hype at all for Dunkirk, but will surely see it; and i don't want to offend those who adore him, just posting my opinion on the guy.",none,,2021-03-08 16:30:11.515921,0

Why do we watch movie reviews or better yet, why do you as an individual watch movie reviews. I personally watch them because I love movies and love talking about and hearing people talk about movies - good or bad, doesn't matter, I just like hearing movies being talked about. I also watch reviews because I like hearing someone's opinion of a film, as it helps me gage a more realistic perspective so I don't enter a film over hyped (thus not getting disappointed and disliking a movie more than I probably should, just because it didn't meet an unachievable bar set by drawn out excitement.) Generally speaking, most reviews for over hyped movies aren't as positive as one's expectations want them them to be. So when a reviewer says, ""yeah its good, but here are the issues."" It brings my expectations down from cloud9, brings them into the real world and I almost always enjoy the movie so much more than I probably would have other wise. Not to mention, I'm thinking about what the reviewer said while I watch the film and am making up my own opinion based on the knowledge/opinion of what I heard. 

thanks for alway being amazing and honest and provoking Jeremy. This is why I'll always watch your reviews! You're the best, keep up the good work :)",none,,2021-03-08 16:30:12.760092,1

A review is just that, one persons opinion. Sometimes times it's an opinion you agree with, sometimes it isn't. We tend to follow those who we agree with, more fun to have someone who agrees with you.
 The majority of the time I tend to agree with Jeremy, which is why I have listened to him. A few times we are polar opposites. This is one of those times. 

Everyone's opinion is equally valid as long as you look at it through un-tinted spectacles. Ie, 'I truly hate sci-fi movies, I'm reviewing the next Star Wars movie'. Seen that many times on RT reviews. 

What I cannot stand is those who say 'Jeremy loved it, so I will love it' or 'Jeremy disliked it, so I won't watch it now' or even better 'it only got 65% on RT, that's not enough for me. It looked really good to me, but I'll listen to a bunch of strangers.' 

Yes if it's hanging around 10% on RT with universally negative reviews, I would give it a miss myself. But if it's universally praised, with just a few negative reviews, see for yourself. Maybe the negative reviewers were right, it does happen. Or maybe your denying yourself a great movie because you listened to a single review.",none,,2021-03-08 16:30:12.760755,0

Before everyone gets angry let me explain.

I'm not saying he can't hate this movie but the criticisms he provides are because he's trying to make this movie as a generic as other movies he has seen before. He says stuff like why don't I understand what this character is trying to get back to after the war. Please tell me how many war films we have seen that in? 

What Nolan is trying to show here is that there were 400000 people here and not just 5. He is trying to show the brutality of war not some campfire scenes where people sit around and talk about the baby they haven't seen at home or their wives. He's trying to show how quickly life can end in the blink of an eye and how not everyone gets a hero shot. Now if you watch the movie objectively and get it for what it is and then give a fair assessment then you can say well I appreciate what it was but I didn't enjoy it. But he wanted this movie to be saving private Ryan and hacksaw ridge, the funny thing is, if it was like those movies, then I'm sure we would be getting reviews like wow how similar is this movie to that and it's not as good or something like, how many times do we have to see the same movie.

I love Nolan because he takes very interesting ideas and visualizes them in ways we haven't seen before. The mark of an amazing director.",none,,2021-03-08 16:30:13.697993,0

Does that ultimately affect YOUR enjoyment of the movie? I've been a fan of JJ since 2010, but more than likely I will disagree with Jeremy once I see it but to flame him and his opinion just because he disagrees with your opinion or preconceived notion is sophomoric. 

To be fair, Jeremy's criticism is one that has been voiced even in other positive reviews, Chris Stuckmann said as much.  The film from what I understand, lacks traditional characterization, something Nolan intended. Now it looks like Jeremy didn't know that before hand but even if he did...he's allowed to disagree with that approach of Nolan's if it hurt his own enjoyment of the film.  For others the sensory experience completely overshadowed the lack of traditional characterization and some reviewers have noted that some of the characterization that does occur doesn't happen in dialogue. 

Jeremy didn't like the last two Nolan movies and yes, it does feel kind of nice when people whose opinions you value align with yours.  But just because they don't doesn't mean you need to attack the guy.

But what I'm annoyed with is the people who watch a Nolan movie and then act that movie is the best thing ever to come out. I fell like he's the director that people who don't know a lot about movies point to and say is amazing. It really started happening when Interstellar came out. People kept telling me how amazing it was, and that Nolan was an absolute genius and the best director ever. And then you ask these people if they have ever seen a Kubrick or Scorcese movie, and they have no clue who either of them are.

Saying that every movie needs characters and a story is no less stupid than saying it needs none of these, just visuals. Movie is (first of all) a VISUAL medium. It is totally acceptable to make it a visual experience IF it is reasonable. And this time it WAS reasonable, because it showed us a desperate situation. It wasn't desperate because Michael had a wife waiting for him at home and their baby girl was on the way. Why? Was it less desperate for Phil, who didn't have anyone? Was it less desperate for the cook on the ship, who hated his family? Was it less desperate for a captain who just wanted to do his job? This wasn't the focus, it did not matter. There were thousands of people there and there was a chance that none of them would ever get home. NONE OF THEM. Regardless of their past, regardless of their conscience, they were all equally f*cked and meaningless in that situation. And I think that's why the movie was made the way it was made. Now this is just my opinion, I'm not saying that yours is any less important, that's not true. Maybe I'm overthinking it and maybe Nolan really made this movie only because he thought it would look cool. But that's not how I know Nolan. If you see a seemingly meaningless frame in a Stanley Kubrick movie, you will never assume it's there just to ''look good''. To me it's the same with Nolan. I don't believe that he would ever make a shallow movie just to get money. Back in 2005 after Batman Begins he refused to make a sequel saying that he did not have an idea for a GREAT MOVIE. It was one of the most successful superhero movies ever, but he waited almost 2 whole years to even CONSIDER making a sequel. I don't think that he's in for the money. That's my opinion.

It is apparent Jeremy wanted something in this film that Nolan never intended for.

I applaud Nolan by being ambitious with what he intended, and then following up with near perfect execution of said intentions. However, some people will not understand what the story's nature is, featured around ""survival"" and ""communal heroism."" There are no main characters here, even though some are followed more than others. They honestly should be cared for equally, and that's how I felt when watching it, and I think that's what Nolan intended.

What I stated in my IMDb review (find soulsk8ter225) is that in a perfect world I kind of wish Nolan filmed a 2+ hour version, and had two cuts to it: the version we see now, and an extended version with character development. You get to choose your cut of the film you'd like to see. Or, at least, have that kind of thing on Blu-ray.

Ultimately, I'd say this much: while it's cool to break the mold every once in a while and have a film that leaves out that character development fluff, it does go to show there is a reason why that ""fluff"" tends to exist in most movies, including United 93 (at least for the plane passengers). Dunkirk is fine being the exception, but not the rule.

Normally I wouldn't ever say this on another person's channel, but Chris Stuckmann's review more accurately retells the depiction of Nolan's film, so I suggest you check that out. Then check out the film, and decide for yourself whether or not you believe the lack of character development is a hindrance to you or not.",none,,2021-03-08 16:30:14.486700,0

Christopher Nolan's strength is actually concept and plot as I have noticed in the lot of his movies. However, his weakness is really characterizing his characters. Yeah, Batman, inception and prestige and interstellar have a good set of characters, but I've noticed that the characterization of the movies I mentioned isn't as strong due to the fact that the plot and concept is really the centerpiece of his works. The only reason why his films give us that impression that there is character in his *characters* was because he uses the audiences' interpretation of how we understand these characters rather than making a solid definition of what these characters are... if that makes sense?

That's why we're left with a cliffhanger from Jeremy.....BECAUSE WE'LL NEVER KNOW HIS FINAL SCORE. 
Because Bitches like you can't handle the truth.

Look at it this way.....it might appeal to fans of the director.....that we'd have to look back and Google Dunkirk and read up on History about Dunkirk then going to see the movie Dunkirk....then you'll be pulled into liking Dunkirk. BUT TO THE GENERAL AUDIENCE WHICH IS 90% OF PEOPLE, Do You Really Think They'll Go Through Reading The History Of Dunkirk Before Seeing The Movie?

That's one of Nolan's problems. I've always found that characters in a Nolan story never get enough developed enough, or sometimes key characteristics about them get glossed over real fast. With Inception for example, even though we learn so much about Cobb I never felt any real connection to his character or any character in the movie. Sometimes the movie even felt like a montage. Like every exposition had to be done as fast as possible with some epic background music and barely any of the scenes had time to breathe. 

Even though Christopher Nolan created the greatest villain in movie history he can suck at character creation sometimes.",none,,2021-03-08 16:30:16.267384,0

There are so many tragedies that happen and you think what happened is horrible but when you listen to the families and friends and know people's stories surviving the scenario or loosing  someone you care more. Without the emotional touch it's just a story. Horrifying but still a story. That's what happened with the Syrian refugees crisis too. It was just a story of something happening in Syria until we say the picture of the boy's dead body on shore. And that's the problem he addresses Dunkirk has. While it's a good and realistic depiction of a scenario what is needed was a perspective for me. Not necessarily them talking about families and friends but just their situation. Maybe just a quiet guy who is experiencing the horror so that I can use him to experience the horror too. Thats the problem. That although I can see the horror I don't feel it to the extinct the characters on the screen feel it.

Nolan wanted to remind the audience that the soldiers, the pilots and the ships captains were all ordinary people with ordinary live, and he tried to do this by making the characters us. He wanted us to feel as if the action was happening to use, rather than characters on a screen, which resulted in the characters not having very detailed backstories, because those don't matter when you have made the audience feel as if they are the characters.
 I personally feel that this worked, and as such I love this movie. I also feel that if I approached this movie as a reviewer, then i would not be immersed, because when you are examining the shots used or the dialougue, you are no longer watching a movie but trying to analyse a series of scenes. When the whole point of a movie is to make you feel truly immersed, if you are constantly shifting yourself out of that immersed state to concentrate on the review, you are no longer experiencing the movie how it is supposed to be seen.

And let me tell you, Jeremy. I love it when you're being honest with us. Your take and thoughts on different movies is what makes me adore you. And inspires me to review movies myself. Don't think I'll do it as good as you. But I'll sure try. Thank you for blessing us with your presence on YouTube for over 6 years! 
Q: What is the rating you would overall give this movie? 
The way how I took it is like this.
You said that the sound effects of the movie was really great and makes you feel like you're in the war with them due to how it looked and its cinematography. So that made me think it's better to get it on Blu-Ray. However, you stated that the characters you get no time to understand them or know their past. Like how did they get wrapped up in fighting this war at the time. So the characters we'd probably forget in T-minus 10 minutes. 
If you put that altogether, if I'm not missing any more of your honest opinions, this movie could barely be a ""pretty good time, no alcohol required"". 
But that's just my analysis. I'd love to hear your answer if you do respond.
P.S Rotten Tomatoes is a pretty good site for movies. But it's just people's opinions and experiences with the movie. If they love this movie, then great. I won't stop them. But I will say this. 
This movie is no ""Saving Private Ryan"" or ""Platoon"" or ""Glory"". But a very good try in the realm of War movies.",none,,2021-03-08 16:30:17.582873,0

Not every movie has to have characters in a war movie and you need to learn about the damn backstory of every soldier and cry for them to get back to their family alive. Mad Max was a good movie of just non stop action without much charcter development because sometimes you just want to enjoy the moment not bore yourself about people you'll forget about the next day. Sometimes it's about focusing on what actually happened, wars weren't fought for entertainment purposes. This movie is different because it was just a group of people trying to get the hell out of certain death. Sometimes stories don't help you with that, you're just anxious to escape inevitable death. That said, respect your opinion anyways, but will still go see it.",none,,2021-03-08 16:30:17.582894,0

I have come to a conclusion that he values characters alot. And is willing to look over a few plot discrepancies if the characters speak to him and develop as he watches him. Now I may be complety wrong but I think his ranking for the boxes he wants to tick for a good movie are
1. Characters
2. Plot
3. Spectacle
 Now I personally rank Plot over Characters but me and Jeremy seem to see eye to eye on most movies. Notable exceptions are Suicide Squad and Elysium. On both the characters were fun, endearing and interesting but the plot was so sketchy I could not buy into it. However this rarely happens because of u r a good screenwriter u know how to make ur characters appeal to the audience and make a cohesive plot.

I hope it inspires other film makers to do the same when dealing with historical events. Passchendaele, Pearl Harbour - those movies focused heavily on the characters, their story, tried to get you to give a damn. They failed completely, and the telling of the story of the battle / event was severely compromised due to this misguided focus.

Just continue to give your honest opnion, that's why I watch your videos. 

I also saw this movie yesterday and of course I respect your opinion (I watch many of your reviews), but I have to disagree with you. I'm on the side of most of the other critics, this is my favorite movie from Nolan (TDK & Inception #2 & #3). Eveyone's entitled to their own opinion, but it feels like you missed the point of the movie. This is a movie about suspense and the experience not about the characters. We don't need to know them, we don't need a backstory, actually I'm glad it isn't there. This isn't a character study, it's a masterclass in suspense building. Had there been backstory the movie wouldn't have pulled off its sense of urgency and that was the whole point of the movie. We already know what the stakes are and that everyone will lose everything during the war so there was no need to have that kind of exposition or backstory. They're just people and they're trying to survive and that's all you need to know. That's the fun thing about movies, people have different opinions and you don't always have to agree with everyone.

Edit: Maybe suspense is the wrong word. I like this movie, because it's immersive. Just a few minutes in it feels like you're actually there on the beach. I almost forgot I was watching a movie. Imo that's an incredible feat and that's the main reason I like this movie. But as you probably already found out it's hard to accurately describe this movie and the best (and only) way to really know if you like it, is to watch the movie.",none,,2021-03-08 16:30:17.916658,26

I just like to know what goes on ""behind the scenes"" and ""in the minds of extremists"" so to speak. This became an obsession for me long ago when I was like 15 and introduced to critical thinking and got the idea of always challenging my views by hearing out the opposite side of any discussion. I do this both online and offline and I somehow manage to blend in anywhere and be accepted into any group. I also have an amazing ability to get people to trust me and spill their secrets. I know so many people who are murderers, pedophiles, criminals, etc. because they've all confessed to me and I am an adept in getting people to believe I am 'one of them'. A lot of it is going with the flow of the conservation, picking up on some hint at what they like, and dropping hints I'm into it as well, and I rapidly gain their trust. I think of myself as ""the keeper of secrets"" because I literally carry the potentially life-destroying secrets of hundreds of people. I have no intention to actually do anything with any of this or to cause any harm. I also think of myself as a kind of gondola meme incarnate, forever watching the world, learning everything, but not engaged in any of it. I also practice psychic abilities that allow me to take these things even a step further by allowing me to access the minds of others and see and experience everything from their point of view, so that for example, I can get into the mind of a random cashier at a coffee shop in my city and I can feel what their body feels like, think what they think, feel what they feel, hear what they say, and see what they see. I think that god grants me this access to people's minds because I keep it all secret, all private. I do nothing to harm others with this information… but yeah I've literally infiltrated and been in many famous and controversial groups and I know how to make people think I am any religion I want them to think, any ideology, etc.

I totally disagree that all the heroism is sucked out! Its very heroic!! Altho it was a retreat and it was horrific and often chaotic  there was so much heroism and glory in the retreat because to get almost all 300,000 troops off that beach was crucial in Britain resisting against the nazis!

Its so interesting that as an american you saw it that way when the british public didn't.

It's not that I couldn't splice together a highlight reel to support Grace's opening statements here, it's just that I could also splice together just as much footage to dispute it, or at least show that the film is more balanced than Grace remembers.

The pilot staying, knowing he will run out of fuel, the Admiral staying for the French at the end of the movie, the soldiers cheering when the two dudes get over the hole in the pier with the wounded dude, when the French kid goes back and opens the hatch for the soldiers trapped below, and of course the swell of emotion when the fleet of civilians arrives and the solders cheer them. I know the civilians aren't solders, but then one of Nolan's recurring themes is how ""heroes"" is a broad term that encompasses everyone who's rowing the boat in the direction of what's right. When you couple that with the ending and the British people cheering their returning, defeated soldiers, it's all about how we're all flawed and weak and strong, all together, all at different times, and we have to help each other and be forgiving of one another when we are not strong.

The Thin Red Line was a masterpiece, even if it the film wasn't successful, BladeRunner was a flop. You're a Feminist and you're mad because the movie didn't have enough gays; blacks; and women.

See in the USA you adore the military, it goes way back to when America fought the British to get out of the country; here in the UK it's a very different story, yes we love our armed forces but not to the same extent in the USA. You bring up that soldiers are acting cruel to other people, now Cillian Murphy's character had shell shock and sadly & accidentally killed George because he was suffering shell shock and out right fear, the thing is the men are not acting like soldiers because they have been stripped of that they are no longer soldiers but men in fear trying to get home. The second death being of the Frenchmen wearing a British uniform, well this can relate to consequentialism, where they made a judgement it's either save the small amount of men on the boat or everyone dies, as we say your damned if you do and damned if you don't.  When you relate this to Band of Brothers, this was 4 years after Dunkirk, the Allies were winning the war, whereas 1940 it was a different story America was not in the war, Britain was alone, Europe had been covered in a black blanket. Again as you said in your trailer analysis, this story means a heck of a lot more in the UK because it's to do with us and our fight for survival, ready for the next battle being the Battle of Britain, again relating it back to why the RAF section was in the film.  My overall view is that the film was fantastic it was perfect you don't need a long script because it's not about the characters it's about the situation that they are in, and those fighting to survive, fighting to protect and fighting to save those men.",none,,2021-03-08 16:30:19.158594,0

This is the one that got me the most. Like it's been stated elsewhere Nolan believes his audiences are not stupid and will understand his films. That they are able to keep up. This is one such film. Separate time scales that you really should just get. American Sniper for its strengths leaves alot of truth behind to appease it's audience and possibly Oscar panels too. Saving Private Ryan is far better but goes for that in this together heroics at times and heroes all. What I think Dunkirk shows is war realistically. Terrified young men out for number one primarily. People in such scenarios generally run and hide. In war or from a crazed sniper in a hotel window. Fear and survival are human. This film shows reality and reality of life very clearly being in jeopardy. It'd be unrealistic to have all the soldiers defiantly shooting at planes with their chests pumped up with an equally heroic score in a Pearl Harbor Michael Bay let's try to win Oscars slo mo crowd pleaser. There are plenty of heroes and heroics on show. Along with a feel of reality. Would you stay with a soldier you met recently or would you run to save your life? You cant say and I think this film says that too in non Hollywood fashion. If Nolan wants an Oscar he's not willing to compromise a truth to get it like perhaps other directors you mentioned absolutely did. This is a realistic film of a real event. It deserves truthful handling despite uncomfortable moments that ring true. It is full of heroes but war isn't largely about heroes. It's about survival and surviving long enough to be victorious. A key moment that you missed is the blind man handing out blankets. We didn't do anything? Harry Styles leading the charge would appeal to his teenage fans but I thought it quite brave to go for the opposite of that so despite him not being my cup of tea well done for that choice! Heroes are not always brave. And like the blind man said.....,none,,2021-03-08 16:30:19.158821,0

Tom Hardy's character gave up a safe landing back in jolly ole England, to take out German bombers on his reserve fuel tank, and was captured on the beach for his efforts.  The British Navy Admiral, staring into the abyss of a dive bombing German plane, bracing himself with dignity and fear awaiting his death (which was spared by the heroics of Tom Hardy's character) and who at the end remained to see to it that French soldiers were also rescued was a hero too.

There were a mix of soldier stories at play, not just the anti-hero.

I frankly couldn't stand the music,,,Hans Zimmmer technique for building tension...way too much of it. And come on Grace, Zimmerman's Music from Interstellar was fantastic.

Sound effects, especially the aerial combat scenes was great! I'd love to see a re make of the Blue Max, with today's technologies.

I couldn't hear much of the dialogue and what was spoken I couldn't hear......

Nolan going after the LA LA LAnd approach to non traditional film making story telling to win an Oscar was too obvious.

This isn't some bullshit romanticised Hollywood We're-All-In-This-Together crap. This was real life. Chris Nolan didn't create a movie, he told a story. 

The soldiers in Dunkirk had just fought against Germans, with the Germans pushing the allies back to the beach. At that point, most of, if not, all of those soldiers were probably already defeated, mentally. 

Arriving on the beach awaiting evacuation, they had to endure constant bombings from German planes, the potential threat of the German's breaking through the French/allied defences, and wondering if they were even going to be rescued at all. That lasted over a week. 

Churchill withheld a full scale evacuation, thus meaning the soldiers on the beach had little help from the Navy and even less help from the RAF. 

In Dunkirk, there were roughly 400,000 men, after the evacuation, 338,000 made it off. For the British, 68,000 men were either killed or captured.

This film I feel in a way told a very candid story of what took place on the beach, not all war film celebrates individual heros and successes, and this is certain not one of those genre war film. it is it's own thing, celebrating and telling a story as it happens, without the superficial glorification of individuals but a collective efforts of many to salvage a tragic situation. The fact that this film does not celebrate individual heroism and depicted the solider the way it did did not take away from the respect they deserve but allowed the audience to actually experience remotely, as best as Nolan could hope to replicate, the hardship of war and I think that is the core of its message, not heroism of soldiers. Many times, respect is not won by heroism or act of heroism but it is won by endurance, survival, and perseverance. So I feel ur critique on this film kinda missed the mark.

I thought not having much dialogue was a genius as the incredible music and sound covered all you needed to know in a extremely visual and moving way.. without wrapping it all up in cheesy 'Hollywood style' speeches.

It was an embarrassing loss due to the use of archaic strategies and a high command that was thinking 20 years in the past, just like during the First World War.

Even the dousche that Harry Styles plays has a little remorse in the train, he knows he is trash. And the civilians... the blond kid not just lied to the soldier that killed the other boy just to confort him because of everything he went through, but also made the other kid a war hero in the local newspaper, something he said himself before dieying.

And of course heroic stories and movies are more fun to watch, but I think they're less reflective of what would actually happen if the average person were the focus. And so, while I see your point Grace, about it being too much ""every man for himself"", I think this movie is probably more accurate than ""fun"".  

Most of the men in this situation, and in most war situations, are very young and very inexperienced with life.  Think high school kids, or recent graduates. And so when they find themselves in these situations, they are very much out of their element.  They're plucked from home and pushed into these horrific, inhumane situations.  And so at Dunkirk, there they are stranded on a beach for days, with nowhere to go, and nothing to do but wait to see what solution their leaders will come up with, or at the worst, when and how their end will come.  And by the way, many of their leaders aren't much older than they are.  (Lieutenants are likely early to mid-20-somethings.)

So as I was watching this I was thinking that this may have been fairly accurate.  It wasn't complete chaos and panic, but it was desperate, to where I can imagine the situation devolving into an every man for himself scenario.  I thought of this as a ""you are there"" movie, where we're being put into the shoes of the person who's in the scene, and seeing and experiencing it how they might. Was it fun to watch?  No it wasn't, and I probably won't see it again.  But it was worth watching once.  Though I agree with the general sentiments I'm hearing that the airplane scenes were probably the best part of the movie.",none,,2021-03-08 16:30:19.522414,0

I found myself genuinely moved when the boats finally arrive, and at the Churchill speech at the end. Maybe it's a cultural thing, but it resonated with me. And as for the cruelty displayed, it reflects the desperation of the circumstances, the abject cruelty of war.

The word "" Dunkirk Sprit"" is now part of our language. It means that even when things seem at their darkest we will unite and come through. 

The film is not about heroes, it's about the situation we were in. We were surrounded and the British government thought we could only get 30, 000 back instead with the help of the "" little ships"" as we call them we got nearly "" 400,000 back. 

It's nice to have heroes in a movie and if it had been made by an American it would have but to my mind it would have taken away the true story the movie was trying to portray. 

It's a stunning piece of storytelling it's not about heroes it's about survival.

We British don't want our war movies to be star-spangled, sugar-coated, self-congratulatory feel-good stories as many American war movies are.  We moved on from that a long time ago. Also, we're the masters of self-deprecation; it's a national pastime ;-)

That aside, I found Dunkirk to be incredibly patriotic film, with plenty of examples of heroism; the and bravery of ordinary civilians doing their duty to save lives, the  highly-skilled airmen, who shoot down half a dozen German planes between them, Tom Hardy's character who stays to defend the boats rather than returning home, Kenneth Branagh's character who stays behind to help evacuate the French... The list goes on.

And that final scene, where they give beer to the soldiers on the train, and he reads out Churchill's speech? Brilliant.

Hans Zimmer is also one of my favourite musical artists (not just film composers) of all time, and the Gladiator soundtrack is my favourte album period. so there's another thing we have to disagree on.",none,,2021-03-08 16:30:19.942146,0

Hardys character, I think, the best character. Styles character was alright I didn't see a problem with his character choice and I don't think it will lessen his career at all. and lastly I think the focus should have been more on the message which I think was, if people of today would have done the same. my question is, is it true other people/critics are just going along with the movie because its a Nolan film? because yours is the only review that I've heard a few bad notes, everyone else is saying its perfect.",none,,2021-03-08 16:30:19.942343,0

I personally was never a fan of Band of Brothers, American Sniper, or Saving Private Ryan... even though all of those movies were realistic in the violence they portrayed and the terrors of war, they also still encouraged this weird, almost superhero, version of military men...specifically military men who were in a higher position of power other than Private...on the other hand this movie was much more focused on making the heroes more empathetic...not necessarily more likable...but I felt like these characters did similar things to what I would do in that situation, which is most often selfish...the thing about Dunkirk historically is that even though there was great heroism from the civilians and the air-force at the end...when soldiers on the ground were that confused and were convinced they were going to die, they did some selfish things in the name of their own survival. I also personally loved how there was never a moment where ""family back home"" was talked about or over-romanticized. Harry Styles did great...his costar Fionn was better, but Fionn also got considerably more focus and screen-time to prove himself. I agree that middle-america and the academy will likely not enjoy the message of this film, but that's fine...I wouldn't care if I were Nolan and he doesnt seem to be the type of person who would need Oscar validation. I actually recommend that everyone go out and watch some of the interviews with him because you can tell he really did genuinely care about this story and there is a lot that can go unnoticed. The themes of the story were still ultimately about the growth and inner fortitude required to go from selfishly looking out for only yourself to becoming a piece in a larger battle for survival that isnt just about you.

The one point I wholeheartedly agree with you on is the way Nolan chopped up the various plot lines and intersected them at random times. It made it very hard to follow this movie, But mostly the film would cut off to a new part right when the previous scene was reaching its climax… Which robbed the audience of heightened climactic moments that were being built upon in momentum. They should have just filmed the last day of the Dunkirk evacuation and started out with Tommy reaching the beach, many scenes of the Stuka dive bombers pounding them as well as the bleakness of the situation. Then move into the scenes where the British Navy failed to get them a crossed successfully and then followed up finally with the British people coming on their boats culminating in a dramatic air battle with obviously Tom Hardy",none,,2021-03-08 16:30:19.943552,0

Now the Germans on the other hand were very conscientious of getting their troops out of really bad situations with surgical precision and care.

You need to read more books about war. The way war is potrrayed in hollywoods is to glorify the fallen, but among the fallen there are always rapists or thiefs or normal people. They aren't all good they aren't all bad. Even among Germans there were good people, and even among allied forces there were bad people, life's like that.

Read about the rape of naking and the rape of the German women by the soviets and some say americans took part too of that, but I love that Nola did it in a realistic way.

It creates an experience which is difficult for films to do in my opinion.  The time hops caught me off guard but once I caught on I loved the game of putting things together.  As far as how the military is protrayed...i think he's showing us human nature not that he tries to discredit the organization.  I've been in 15 years...its actually accurate in many ways and I don't say that lightly.  It's one thing to run into war hyped up from training and tech but when you get there and realize exactly what it is...see mentors and friends go in very unheroic ways...you cannot say how you'll do.  Things can be very fragile and these days it's dog eat dog all around so all you need sometimes is the right dynamic. But like how the men on the boat didn't judge the shell shocked man...even tried to shield him in some ways...the film looks at things from many angles and makes a good statement with these scenes.  Can you judge if you haven't walked those steps?  I think this film attempts to simulate those very steps and does so well.

Sure, some of the soldiers got a bit selfish in their fear, but that does happen and this event was pretty close to the start of the war - a lot of these guys would have been very green 18 or 19-year olds. The spitfire pilots act in a brave and selfless way, as do the civilians, navy guys, nurses, etc. manning the evacuation ships.  The army officers aren't super optimistic at the beginning, and have to make some tough choices (about whether to prioritize wounded or non-wounded troops, for instance), but they hold it together.  

Dunkirk veterans and other WWII vets don't seem to have a problem with the portrayal - though many in France are evidently a bit miffed at the way their role was downplayed.

The way those soldiers acted is the reality of the situation, you even heard him say essentially they told the public they were leaving hand in hand with the French but in reality it was English only on the English boats that's just how it was.

Alfred Hitchcock never won an Oscar so If Nolan never wins, it is no great loss because his films will be studied and remembered. The Dark Knight is still film that will be studied and dissected by students and aspiring directors of action films - it made a ton of money and also had critical acclaim.

War movies aren't the propaganda pieces of the past. A lot of dark things happened. I""m not saying all sides are equal but if you believe there isn't fear, cowardice, despair and courage then you are lucky - you haven't had to experience too many events in your life of crisis and tragedy. People do act selfishly and thoughtlessly. It was a dark time - it was probably the closest the Nazis came to winning the war in Europe.

You shouldn't dislike an actor for a character he/she portrayed. Playing a hero does not make that person heroic. Playing a coward does not make that person a coward. If you are so convinced after seeing a film, TV show or play, you are either very gullible or have seen a great performance.",none,,2021-03-08 16:30:20.280802,0

your opinion. But I respectfully disagree in that this movie portrays British
soldiers in a terrible light. Yes there are scenes in this film especially with
Harry styles and Cillian Murphey that cannot be considered heroic quite the
opposite in fact, but Nolan was going for utter realism and this is the realism
of war, in this case the majority young men pushed into an extreme situation of
survival. The film features acts of bravery and honour also Hardy’s character for
one (spoiler alert) stacking the odds against himself and giving up his freedom/life
(once captured who knows his fate) to save more lives from the relentless
attacks of the Luftwaffe, there are many more examples but this comment would
be rather long to list them all. But this is the realism of war. As for lack of
dialogue again when bullets are whizzing past your heads and bombs are
dropping, you don’t care whether the person next to you has a story or where about
back home they are from you just want to accomplish your objective, come out
alive and survive together for the next fight, Then when your home dry or in relative
safety you can have a chat about this sort of thing. As far as Oscars go Nolan
could be in with a shout. I would love to see him make a movie about the battle
of Britain which proceeded this in events of the war and was a fantastic
victory.",none,,2021-03-08 16:30:20.280913,0

As I said Grace, I totally respect your opinion on whether you liked this film, or not (as the case may be :) but I hope I have said something about why this battle, and evacuation, was DIFFERENT.  It wasn't a Pearl Harbour, or even a D-day, those were tremendous and horrific battles, but neither were actually about the very survival of a nation.  For Americans it is maybe only in the great struggles of 1776 that there is some kind of parallel.
Anyway,
Thank you and best wishes, James. (apologies for 'going on' just a bit.  I am a terrible bore when it comes to history, and films!!:)

Ps- I am not trying at all to downplay America's role in the war, they bascally kept' Britain afloat and provided the strength, and vigour to kep fighting in Africa and Western Europe, not to mention paying for almost the entire allied effort (including massive 'loans', never to be repaid by the USSR!)",none,,2021-03-08 16:30:20.786396,0

They start off feeling like they are undefeatable, but then suffer a massive setback which causes them to question everything, even to the point of giving up entirely.  But then, they just have to tough it out and they make it through and what follows is the Britain that could not be defeated in WW2.  I saw this on a macro-level for Britain as a country, and then the soldiers themselves discovering aspects of themselves (heroism in the midst of utter desolation) that would presumably propel them on to eventual victory.

I think it's more unrealistic the way Hollywood tends to portray soldiers as willing to sacrifice their lives.

I saw Dunkirk today too, and I didn't see the movie in the same way that you did at all.  In fact, I saw plenty of heroism and self sacrifice on the part of the British Soldiers.  For instance (*Spoilers ahead if you haven't seen the movie)...
*
*
*

- Tom Hardy virtually sacrificing himself to protect the soldiers and sailors at sea and on the beach when he knew full well that he would run out of fuel, and even AFTER he ran out of fuel.
- Kenneth Branagh's character staying behind to evacuate the French.
- Gibson swimming back to open the hatch and save the soldiers trapped below decks on the ship that had just been torpedoed.
- Tommy sticking up for Gibson (the Frog) when the rest of the soldiers want to throw him out of the trawler.
- The civilian boat captains who rescued the soldiers (Yeah...  Nolan could have played this up more, but the movie was more about the battle).

Yes...  There was lots of ugliness on display too, but let's face it... the British and French forces were having their collective behinds handed to them at this point in the war.  They were beaten, driven to the beach and surrounded with seemingly no way to escape.  Ships were being sunk and there was virtually no air cover.  Meanwhile, they were being regularly strafed by the luftwaffe and shot at be German soldiers.  They guys in the trawler were literally stuck inside a tin can that had holes being shot in it, and as the tide rolled in, they started to sink.  These are not exactly conditions that bring out the best in mankind.

I do agree with you that the non linear storytelling got a bit confusing from time to time, and I often found myself wondering what the film would look like had they just edited it together in a normal fashion, but on the whole, I found the film to be an exhilarating, action packed and immersive experience that outs you right in the heart of the battle.

I think it's based on Peter Cazenove who crash landed at Dunkirk and was captured. The shell of his spitfire remained on the beach until it was washed away. They recently dug it up and restored it. So when she says it's fiction she is completely wrong . I don't think this shows British soldiers in a bad light at all. They were kids desperate to get home. They had spent days stuck on a beach with no hope. They had with endless attacks from dive bombers and shells picking them of relentlessly. Meany British soldiers stayed behind to hold the line alongside the French army, they  are the unsung heroes of Dunkirk and I think it's a shame they didn't get much of a mention. The young men on the beach were terrified and meany had been separated from there friends and regiments. Any human of any nationality would act exactly the same. It's human instinct to survive. They had lost the battle and they  had no moral other than a faint hope they could survive and get back home across the few miles of chanel. I don't understand this review at all.

That was one of my complaints in my review as well. Also, the non linear storytelling mixed with the not getting to really know any of the characters were other flaws in this film. Where you lost me on this review though is the constant Oscar talk and how Nolan should of studied Speilberg or Cameron... like, this is Christopher Nolan. He made the war film HE wanted to make and even though it came with some issues within the story, I actually respect the fact he made a war film unlike any I have seen before! Not saying it was a masterpiece but it was different and I appreciate that. He takes chances. And I respectfully disagree with the mention of being disrespectful to the soldiers simply because I believe Christopher Nolan did extensive research on this film. Agree with you on the technical aspect, it was a gorgeous film. I must say that Hans Zimmer in my opinion has made MANY memorable scores. The dude is an absolute genius. I truly don't think Christopher Nolan could care less if he gets nominated for on Oscar and if he does it would not be political. I thought this film was good, had its flaws, but in terms of his direction he deserves a nomination. But again, I believe he doesn't even consider that when making these films. With all this said, I like how we can discuss different opinions and get a conversation about film going! Hope you're doing well, Grace.

My hubby and I are seeing it a week on Monday. We both,as huge Nolan fans,feel he's sold out a bit doing this film just to get an award. He should be recognised for the amazing films he does regardless of subject matter.
I'm curious to see if I agree with your view that all human spirit was missing from the movie. My maternal grandad was a scientist during WW2 so he wasn't a soldier. When the call went out for civilians to help at Dunkirk he went back and forth several times in his hobby fishing boat to rescue soldiers. It's sad to hear that element of the story hasn't been shown 😕

As far as Grace's comments on this film is concerned, I don't think that Nolan tried to portray the British soldiers as cowardly and villainous as she makes them out to be.  I think Nolan struck a balance between showing different types of soldiers who were willing and able to sacrifice themselves for the sake of others and those who were downright scared as s*** and out for themselves.  I will have to agree that the only downside to Dunkirk were the unnecessary deaths of the two that I think she's referring to since I think it felt out of place especially since we're dealing with a film with no character development whatsoever.

Soldiers are people, therefore as people they have flaws and issues. Just imagine living during WWII. To depict their flaws is not disrespect, it only makes them more human and real, putting them on a pedestral whatever they do is wrong, they are people, not deities and in a way I think glorifying them means to glorify war which is a no no. Respect and gratitude for their sacrifice does not mean sanctifying them.",none,,2021-03-08 16:30:21.492959,0

When I was serving with a British officer and he said it best,"" Americans are trained from birth to run into danger at their own expense to help anyone or just to do the right thing WITHOUT THINKING.  Its a reaction.  You are trained to be the hero without knowing it. You will sacrifice your life to help a fellow man, woman, or child you do not know""  He was saying this to me during a 911 tribute while I was in Afghanistan.  He was amazed that that the number of  police, firefighters, and civilian volunteers that were running into the buildings knowing they would die and or be messed up for life.   Or another example is the Airman who was stabbed on the train in Europe due to thwarting a terrorist attack.  He ran into danger to save people from the attack.  You really do not see that in other countries.
So from what I understand, not saying that this does not happen in other countries, this is an American thing.  I have not seen the movie, but plan to do just that.  
I would say that you watched it from the side of the American who has been taught from birth even though you may be small you can be the hero AKA Captain America.  Not every country has the be the hero complex.  Not every country sees trying to make it out of a situation by any means is a coward. And not American would be the hero.  I am sure there are plenty of examples of that is WWII. Look at this from another point of view.",none,,2021-03-08 16:30:21.493025,0

Lightoller took his personal boat to Dunkirk and loaded up with soldiers and made the dangerous trip back. He was not allowed to go back a second time because his little yacht sundowner was deemed too slow. The actor who played Lightoller in Titanic (1997) would be the perfect age to reprise his role in this movie, it would have been a brilliant easter egg and really connected Dunkirk to the level of a James Cameron movie.

And with the triptych style, it had three opportunities to win me over, but there was no resolution within any of them. Maybe this is intentional, but it doesn't reach the mind or the heart the way even Inception or perhaps The Prestige made a solid effort to do. A bleak film like this could use more heart. And in a story about survival, I wanted to care more, not just cock my head quizzically during the credit roll to the tune of Mr. Spock. I did, however, enjoy Dunkirk, but not as I hoped.

Do you know what's really insulting to British soldiers who fought in WW2? Acting as though they have to be portrayed as flag-waving patriotic war heroes in a saccharin, maudlin, phony manner. These are young men - 18,19,20 - conscripted to fight in this war against their will, sent to a place they don't know, with other young men they don't know, terrified, hungry, desperate, trapped on a beach facing utter annihilation. This isn't an all-american war story, this is OUR story.  

Have you ever met a British WW2 veteran? These are noble men who above all are honest about the horrors of war. They don't want to pretend that they are some idealized Hollywood idea of a heroic patriotic fighting machine! They don't buy into that bullshit. They've seen and experienced this world in a way that we haven't, not even soldiers fighting today. When was the last time 400,00 soldiers were trapped on a beach about to be wiped out? I thoroughly suggest you look up WW1 veteran Harry Patch and read and hear what he has said about the horrors of war. Inspiring man, and briefly the oldest man in Europe.

But Grace, do yourself a favour, and go talk to some Veterans, you may find a new perspective on the film that way. If Nolan has managed to get more to the nub of war than Saving Private Ryan has then can't wait to see it. Also, not sure about the dig at Hans Zimmer - he's plenty of memorable scores under his belt, just listened to the Dunkirk OST, and sure, the variation of Nimrod (Variation 15) is superb, but the rest is largely forgettable and not on a par with Interstellar, Planet Earth II, Inception, or (ha) The Thin Red Line.",none,,2021-03-08 16:30:21.863329,1

It does that to people. It didn't portray ALL the British soldiers like that, but certainly some must have done stuff like this. It is a historical fact that many were frustrated with the lack of help from the Air Force, and it is also a historical fact that there was confusion and that many soldiers were 'disobeying' orders and did whatever they could to survive. That's what Nolan shows in this movie, as well as all the trauma that comes with war. Cillian Murphy's character might be the obvious choice, but the soldiers rescued by Mark Rylance show that too, as well as the whole 'mean' conversations in the boat with Harry Styles.
Also, not all hope and heroicism is sucked out of this movie. The air-fighters, the people on the boats, even the soldiers on the pier that helped them carry the injured soldier in the beginning, cheering for them as they walked on that plank. When the civilians' boats arrived, the score became majestic and it was definitely a stand-out moment, as before the score was always ominous. It's also worth noting that many of the civilians' boats were 'confiscated' and not controlled by them, so not all of the rescue ships had civilians in them.
Overall, while it IS cold and bleak, that's the nature of war and of this story. As Churchill said, this was a defeat, and while most troops were evacuated, it was still a massive blow to the Allied Forces in the beginning of WWII. But it's not completely cold and devout of hope. You saw hope and patriotism in Mark Rylance's character, from the first thing scene he is in the movie to the last thing he said. You saw bravery and self-sacrifice in Tom Hardy's character.",none,,2021-03-08 16:30:21.863473,0

To also imply Nolan has disrespected or maligned soldiers is utterly wrong I think you have fell victim to the stereotype of American war movies wherein everybody is happy go lucky and everything is ok in the end 

I saw this film last night and thought it was an incredible piece of work the score and use of diegetic and non diegetic sound was incredible and was such an awesome spectacle on a large imax screen 

I think to truly understand this film you need to understand that this is a true story and put yourself in the soldiers shoes the war would rage on for a further 5 years so this in essence was never going to have the feel of a usual Americanised war movie it is a totally different story with a different aesthetic and feel 

I found it to be utterly relentless and completely captivating, Churchill himself called operation dynamo (Dunkirk) a colossal military disaster and to rescue almost 340 thousand by the 8th day was as he put it a miracle of deliverance 

I really think if you read about the events and rewatch the movie you may have a different appreciation for it

I feel Nolan's nonlinear structure elevated the perspective of all of the lives and duties of those on land, the sea, and the air. It holistically encapsulated all facets of the historical event, and many characters/soldiers were depicted in a very heroic light (The Fighter pilots) as well as the civilian hook: I had chills during the shot of all of the civilian ships approaching the city. And I was asking myself the very question you bring up: whether I would do that today, and I feel Nolan deserves a great deal of credit for pulling it off from my perspective.

Let me explain: you felt this film should have been a Saving Private Ryan (1998), but Nolan never wanted a film like that, and wanted to make a war film similar to The Thin Red Line (1998) (a film that he has publically admitted is one of his favorites...... a film that also has an incredible Zimmer score). Nolan wanted this film to be an EXPERIENCE. He didnt care for developing characters, or fleshing out the historical context of the situation, but he wanted the viewer to experience what it felt like to be in Dunkirk during the evacuation. That's why this film is an essential IMAX viewing, as because thats where the cinematography, score, and sound design will shine best and where the viewer will have the best experience. This film, when it boils down to it, is very similar to The Thin Red Line when you think about it: both films are visceral experiences. The Thin Red Line has gained the reputation as one of the best films ever made, and I think Nolan would gladfully take that over a oscar win anyday.",none,,2021-03-08 16:30:21.864272,0

Why experimental/non-summer blockbustery?
1) No characters that one could truly latch on for emotional impact.

I honestly don't understand how you can feel Nolan's portrayal of the British soldiers was selfish and insulting. Fionn Whitehead and Harry Styles did have a kind of band of brothers relationship, but soldiers aren't supposed to just sacrifice themselves for others. They have to take care of themselves too. As someone who studied history in college, I read first hand accounts of soldiers in various wars across the century, and the universal theme about being a soldier is that is as much an individual experience as it as a group experience, because unlike Star Wars, real-life soldiers are never clones of one another, even on the same team. War is not a series of glorified battles. It is first and foremost a battle of survival. Nowadays, people would rather see the realism in war rather than a glossy glorification of it. It's why other World War II films like Saving Private Ryan still resonate with people. And American Sniper had realism too by showing Chris Kyle struggling with PTSD, which is obviously something Cillian Murphy's character is struggling with in this film.",none,,2021-03-08 16:30:22.293599,0

The British were every man for himself in Dunkirk was because it was their home they were trying to go to. Imagine being stuck in a foreign country with a regime closing in on your location, who, they don't care who you are, they will shoot you on sight. Then imagine, that at any minute you could be shot or exploded from the air, and there is nothing you can do about it. Shooting your rifle, like they did in the movie, truly does nothing to a plane. You won't hit it in the engine. It's too hard of a shot, and don't even get me started on the cockpit, where the pilot is. If you are retarded and need a further explanation on why I say don't get me started, it's cause its an almost impossible shot. Not to mention that you would have to calculate wind speed, the closer rate of the aircraft in the bullet, how fast the plane is going, how fast the bullet is going, and bullet drop, (As well as many other things.) Also imagine that when you get on one of the boats that's trying to save you, it has a high chance of sinking. Talking about when the guy in the beginning on the boat, when he pushed through cause they were going back to Dunkirk, imagine the hell hole that you had done so much to escape from, imagine being taken back there, even when you can just grasp the handle and turn the boat around. 

So yes, it would be an every man for himself situation, especially when this has never been done, before, and everyone around you, including your commanders, are scared.

The way all of the stories he tells hold such human characters dealing with common struggles in these huge fantasy worlds has always amazed me, and probably most others.  Dunkirk however, is not a human story, there was no character in the movie at all.  And I trust that Nolan saw this in his film.  He recreated the events at Dunkirk making the film an immersive experience of what it was like to actually be in the war.  And of course this story takes place after all of these soldiers have already been in battle, every soldier on that beach has already been worn and torn by the war.  I think the lack of character or having a surrogate character is Nolans way of making a statement on war.  Unlike his other movies Dunkirk doesnt have a lot of heart and neither does war.  Hopefully Im right about his message though because otherwise I have no idea why he would make such a dry, confusing, and repetative movie when we all know that he could have written something with more heart.  I walked out of Dunkirk dissapointed, not necessarily because it was bad, but because it was so different from what I had been expecting.  I almost dare to say that this is more Hans Zimmers movie than it is Nolans, without his score, with the exception of a few scenes, I dont think Nolans camera work would have done anything to add intesity to the film.",none,,2021-03-08 16:30:22.294136,0

One I thought you would have the intellectual capacity to understand why the medias portrayal of war is quite simply wrong. You watched the movie once for two hours. I would have expected a much more intelligent insight into this film as I had. Let me give you the intelligence behind everything because you can't quite seem to understand the concept. There are 3 dis fragmented timelines running throughout the film this symbolises the three attributes to Dunkirk, the navy the Raf and the men stuck on land. The men on land have been there for one week waiting for the arrival of the navy, who decided to withdraw the majority of their ships because Churchill was saving them because of the imminent threat of the nazi invasion on Dover which actually happened two years later instead in the sky with the Battle of Britain. Then the Raf was a small team as they didn't want to waste aircraft. And Dunkirk was the surrounded area they were stuck on. The three story's are represented and brought together by the constant ticking of the clock which symbolises the approaching forces and the urgency to get back to england as the stories develop each catch up in time to each other. And some overlap in time. If you noticed at the end the clock stops on the train now all the stories are at the same point bringing the timings together as the pilot gets captured. The pure genius behind this edit brought together by a flawless score and the realism of human depravity instead of heroics makes for suspending take on an evacuation not fucking war, as for the acts of valour which come from the British maritime and public armada they are the true heroes. The end of the film is the smartest part because it totally explains exactly what you have been mind washed into. As Alex Harry Styles thinks he shall be a coward coming back from the fight, the media the newspaper and Churchill s clever spin on the events makes the men out to be heroes when in fact there's nothing heroic this was simply done at the time to keep the morale of the nation high which was basically propaganda. So that's the actual point of the film.",none,,2021-03-08 16:30:22.294179,0

I absolutely adore your reviews, whenever I want to go see a movie I always check to see if you have reviewed it. I'm really looking forward to seeing Dunkirk mainly because of the historical aspect. I'm not really a big Nolan follower so that's not really going to sway my opinion. I like to think myself a bit of a history buff, some may say different but, I have studied specifically WW1 and WW2 British/Canadian history. From what I remember of Dunkirk the event, it really was a lot of every one for themselves. From your description maybe Nolan bent that a bit but I have to say I have a feeling it must be preettttyy close to the reality. It was one of the most desperate efforts of the war. I haven't seen the movie yet so I don't really have the strongest argument but I have to disagree with your opinion on the historical accuracy. However I think you've probably hit the nail on the head in regards to the civilian story, I think Nolan probably wanted to focus on the soldiers but it is equally a civilian story, I would have loved to have the question would you do what they did.

My grandfather told me once while watching American Sniper and Saving Private Ryan, that the way the soldiers spoke about their own lives and everything doesn't always happen. 

I think what you forgot to understand was that this is a story where lots of men were literally out of hope. That's what happens in war. That's how it is. No one talks about their ""true love"" or ""that girl they had a fling with"". No. When you you're going to die, you don't talk much. That's why having no dialogue works. Because it sets the mood of total upcoming disaster. 

It's real. And also, it's different. Because its so serious, MORE so than most war films, will make it unique. Honestly this is the first average review I've seen. So I guess the majority don't feel this way 😅",none,,2021-03-08 16:30:22.294968,0

Christopher Nolan has the most obsessed fans and all because of Batman. They gravitate towards anything Nolan does so critics say, ""We have to like Nolan."" There were death threats sent to critics for giving Dark Knight Rises bad reviews, even after the shooting so that just goes to show you. That said, Nolan had a huge responsibility to get this right. I believe no soldier is the same. They are not clones like in Star Wars. They have lives. I go to movies for the script, for dialogue and if there is none, well impress me otherwise. I don't know what the purpose of this was or to try something new, but again I don't know the purpose.
Atonement (2007 movie) had like a 6 mixture uncut scene and it was perfect representing what Dunkirk was about.

None the less,  I'm ok with the 'reality of war' angle that Nolan was going for, but that 'realism' and pure dread throughout the whole movie... made it really hard to sit through.   I couldn't connect with any of the characters except for Mark Rylance's character (and his sons).   I didn't really care about hardly anyone.   It might be 'real', but it's just not enjoyable.   I guess there's an educational vibe to it... the same vibe you'd get walking through the Holocaust museum in DC, but its definitely not entertaining.

Rape, pillage, unnecessary killings, etc. thanks to the more corney depiction of war that Hollywood has put out I think people forget that wars are never won by neither side. You basically become an animal in survival mode. When you are so high on adrenaline and your life it's on the line you forget about your morals. I haven't seen the movie, but for what you said I think it makes perfect sense that the soldiers would go crazy when they see a boat. If I'm going to die on a deserted island and I see a boat I don't care, I'm taking that boat. And Nolan talked to a lot of veterans and they told him their stories, there is a shot that I heard Nolan taking about in an interview about a soldier going into the water that was directly from a story that several veterans told him. So I think that he did his research, and he found out what is always missing from the movies, that nobody is perfect. I mean there have been numerous reports that soldiers in Irak, Iran, etc. have done pretty horrific things (not all of them of course) but that's human nature. Heck! That's why George R. R. Martin had Daenerys get the unsullied! So they wouldn't do what men normally do in wars.

I found a little more balance between the positive and negative characterizations. Unfortunately, this is a technically beautiful but largely soulless film in my opinion. The George arc being the only resonant component for me. I think Nolan is successful in maintaining a tension throughout the film, but it all just feels kind of pointless in the end (maybe like war itself, but this is a bad war to try to depict that). I don't think the actual human loss or actual human bravery are served in any way by this film existing. This feels like the work of a pornographer attempting to make a romance.

Thanks for that. I would like to chime in on the less than heroic aspects of the British Army as depicted in this movie, and the every man for themselves mentality  during the evacuation. The British Army at that time was weak in it's equipment, experience and (mental) preparation. The 300,000 + soldiers have just had a tremendous beat down from a superior German Army, using a tactic that was up that point only used to invade Poland: BLITZKRIEG. By using flank manoeuvres, shutting down the core communications instantly and literally cutting through the defenses in one swift and condensed strike by land and air, The British Army was cut off from the much better prepared French troops. Perhaps (and this is speculation) the then inexperienced British Army (or British expeditionary Force) was in utter shock, they just have had their asses kicked on an epic scale. And in shock, survival mode kicks in, no time for band of brothers type of bonding and heroics. Just my two cents.",none,,2021-03-08 16:30:22.816817,0

I completely understand your perspective and respect it, but I think these soldiers were in an unimaginable situation and sure some only thought about themselves, but being in the military, you are in a brotherhood and would die for the men standing next to you, which is exactly what Tom Hardy's character did in the end.

This review just goes to show how controversial a film could be. It shows that no 2 pairs of eyes are watching and taking in the craft of the writing, directing, music and acting the same. This movie is bleak, and shows selfishness, despair and loneliness. Obviously if you don't like those things this movie isn't for you. But if you like that possibly more realistic depiction, you'll really like it. The lack of dialogue, in some people's eyes may add to the sense of being in a traumatic situation while others may find it simply boring.

I don't think Nolan tried to PAINT anyone in any specific way, rather he forces certain events in the script to build tenson in the film in a rather contrived way. From the interviews I've seen with Nolan, his primary objective for this film was the suspense and tension. Unfortunately, many of the events that happen in the film come out of seemingly nowhere just to support this, and it can come off making certain characters look bad, especially when we have no back story for them.

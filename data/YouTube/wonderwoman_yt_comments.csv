I was kind of primed to hate it from what I'd been hearing, but actually found myself enjoying the first half hour or so quite a lot. The goofiness of the first action scene stayed squarely in Donner territory and thankfully never quite crossed the line into Lester-land, and I felt the movie was getting a lot right about Wonder Woman's character while having a lot of fun with her. I liked Barbara Minerva's character, even though she was kind of a familiar superhero movie villain trope and I enjoyed Pedro Pascal as Max Lord.  So I started to feel maybe I'd been misled and this movie was kind of awesome ... But then it started going downhill really quickly. I would've forgiven the problematic return of Steve Trevor if that was all that was wrong with this movie, but there was so much more that broke my enjoyment of it. The plot just fell apart like a Jenga tower and some of the action was just laughably badly staged, which was a real surprise after the first movie and the first couple of scenes of this one. I feel sorry for the cast, because they were all pretty awesome. Gal Gadot remains a brilliant choice to play Wonder Woman, I enjoyed seeing Chris Pine back in this (even if his return was really badly plotted) and Kristen Wiig and Pascal both did a great job with some lame material. Considering that Patty Jenkins has been saying in interviews that this was her own true vision, without any interference from the studio, this is really disappointing. And honestly, I think the studio's public commitment to keeping her on for the next Wonder Woman movie now looks like a mistake.",none,,2021-03-09 19:53:37.253796,0

1) Made Hades the villain, which means no Dreamstone with all its convoluted mechanics. Hades simply comes to Diana and offers to revive Steve in exchange for her godly status and powers.
2) As you said, make the fact the Diana loses her powers the central point of the film. Like, she makes the deal and she immediately wakes up next to Steve (who's in HIS body) and without her powers. And she has to actually experience life as a human for a good portion of the film, like Peter Parker in Spider-Man 2. It would've been doubly interesting for Diana, because her story is all about a goddess understanding humanity. The first movie was about her having a first glimpse of our nature, but still from her position of superiority.

The first 60 minutes were bearable. Just bearable.

She has no lover, no friends, no family, and a boring job.
She has great powers but hasn't used them to help others in any great way for 60 years.
How has it taken 60 years to realize she could fly/glide on wind?
Her lasso is computer generated too much. And it can do anything and every thing.
Her costume is ugly.
WW of the comics is the ultimate action hero. WW of the movies, not so much.
An Amazon marathon, a mall skirmish, an Indiana Jones truck convoy rip-off. Yawn.
The Cheetah fights were underwhelming. She's not even named ""Cheetah.""
Max Lord's scenes resembled a TV movie about the life of you-know-who.
Max Lord stood uncomfortably close to people and sweated a lot.

When they are flying in the invisible jet and fireworks appear and it‚Äôs 4 July suddenly‚Äîthat is an alibi and excuse so they could have an invisible plane fly through some fireworks. The monkey‚Äôs paw, though, is _not_ used like that. The entire movie is about cheating, lying and, ultimately, egoism on a supernatural scale that threatens to destroy our species. Diana‚Äôs attempt to cheat at the beginning of the movie is somewhat innocent and forgivable, especially for a kid. But it only seems that way. If everyone did that to get what they want, what kind of world would it be? Reminds of me Kant. We see that play out in the movie. The entire planet begins wishing and wishing, gaining what they want without working towards it, without _achieving_ it through will and action. Diana indulges her desire to be with a dead man; she herself begins to weaken and die the longer she is with him. To live with him means to live with the dead. They talk about the truth a lot, too, and this also makes sense. Getting what you wish for instantaneously makes your reality a lie. There is no truth when your wish is granted. You didn‚Äôt work for it, didn‚Äôt earn it, didn‚Äôt sacrifice time and energy to make it come true‚Äîcome _true._ Instead of accepting her loss and learning to live without her beloved, Diana gives up her reality for a delusion. You can see how this plays out in the other characters, too. I‚Äôm not defending the movie, only the claim that they were using the monkey‚Äôs paw purely for its convenience. I enjoy the abstraction of what this movie could have been. It was poorly realized‚Äîbut there are hints of it.

Yes it was dumb! But here‚Äôs an honest review from me who is a BIG FAN of the first Wonder Woman LITERALLY GOT A 93% on Rotten Tomato‚Äôs. One of the best ratings on a movie! And it‚Äôs honestly my favorite movie and I‚Äôm not a super hero movie fan. Wonder Woman was the best movie we‚Äôve had for a long time to be honest. BUT why ruin such a good movie...the second ‚Äúsequel‚Äù they call it a sequel but it‚Äôs taken place in 1984 but at the end of Wonder Woman we see a tablet and modern and today‚Äôs fashion. Why all of the sudden is it taken place in modern time at the end of the first movie. Then we go back to 1984 when tablets and not a lot of today‚Äôs tech existed? That was something I noticed...another is the movie being based on a ‚Äútruth stone‚Äù like really!? You couldn‚Äôt think of anything better?! And the most dumb character who tries to take over the world through ‚Äútruths‚Äù so he can grant other peoples wishes to gain more power like...also bring Steve back. That was ashamed because we know he died. Why bring him back just so he can die again at the end of the movie. It would be better if it was based on time travel and see what would happen back in Wonder Woman (2017) and learn about Dianas past life. But it was made even more stupid. Also the references showing that the world is going to hell in a way that was a little disrespectful like don‚Äôt show so much hate since it is still supposed to be a family friendly type movie. I really think their shouldn‚Äôt have been a sequel especially if it was going to be this bad. I mean I would think a 7 year old would come up with a better plot. The ending did make me cry though not gonna lie, yes I‚Äôm a baby. But it honestly was a good ending it was just the whole rest of the movie that was bad üòÇüòÇ Sadly I would give this movie a 4/10 it was bad but the ending was good.

Despite all the negative comments that I read on many sites, I decided to see it for myself and rate it according to the experience I had. My appreciation of the film would qualify it as positive in general, of course, if I buy it with the first wonder woman, it cannot beat the first, because WW is an origin film, it is set in the context of a war and that is why It has more and better action scenes and I repeat this is so because of the context where the story takes place, WW84 does not have those elements and it takes place in an urban environment and with totally different situations, but I do not think that it is so bad film as mentioned by many detractors it had. For me it is a movie that fulfills entertaining, contains a positive and optimistic message and has the correct action elements. If we stop comparing it with the first Wonder Woman, you will see that it is not as bad as they tell you. It is my opinion. Greetings",none,,2021-03-09 19:53:37.486859,0

Just beating up bad guys and throwing them across a room just doesn't do it for me. In BvS, it was mostly swordplay; in the 2017 movie, she rode a horse instead of using super-speed; in Justice League, she was overpowered by Superman way too easily; and now in this one she has diminished powers.",none,,2021-03-09 19:53:37.486939,0

Some troubles here and there as always happen in the industry. The movie isn't perfect, it's far from being an action packed one as you and most of the people have wished for a sequel, but is not that bad as you and a lot of reviewers make it seems. I've watched your review when you posted it, but I waited to watch the movie before writing a comment. I did watch it just now. And my conclusion is that men and women are so used to watch action movies made by men and for men that we (me included) are always expecting what the male industry can offer without even notice that. Patty Jenkins did a great job once again in terms of giving to the audience a different perspective of what an action movie about a female hero could be. The movie has a warm honesty, full of soul and emotion. It's not heartless. Wonder Woman is all over it, because it's not just about the character and her powers, but what she does mean inside all the archetypes she dresses. I loved the way Barbra was introduced, even though we've seen it before a thousand times. Loved the way story brought Steve back and how blind Diana became after that and also how she was neglecting her future by trapping herself in a past she idealized, like a teenage that thinks life is meaningless after the loss of a big first love. Although a goddess, she's human after all, and she still has a lot to learn from life and relationships of all sorts. I have my negative points about the movie as well as I have about the first one and I will not point any because people are doing it so much that they completely forgot that the sense of criticism is not about that only, and the movie has a lot more to offer than the flaws people are pitching. And just remembering that ""the rock"" is a stone created by a god for the purpose of creating caos when giving a desired wish in exchange of what one has and preserves the most, and of course the story would surrounds it, the same way as Tolkien makes it to a ring.",none,,2021-03-09 19:53:37.487152,0

I was someone who refused to see it on the grounds that from what I had heard, it had strong far-leftist, feminist and anti-male agenda - that's how people made it sound, like Maxwell Lord was a dancing ""orange man bad"" character. I didn't expect to like the film -so I waited until I watched it online. I was wrong. It was better than I expected, and it really did not busy itself with any social agenda or identity politics. Well. For the MOST part - there was some diversity pandering present (see below). 

The issues I had with it were not non-existent, however:
1. The film begins in her homeland, which is CLEARLY meant to be based very closely on Greek mythology and therefore very similar to Greece and Italy in terms of population and climate. But in the opening sequence, you do see a bunch of black Amazons. My problem with this is that it willfully ignores the fact that the native population of Greece is NOT black, no matter how many migrants have been trying to sneak in lately. The ancient, original population did not consist of very dark skinned sub-saharan Africans. That's just a fact. Greeks are European and as such, LOOK European. TO put this another way, it's like if you had a film set in ancient China - say, Mulan - or a land closely based on ancient China - and in among the Chinese warriors there's a sprinkling of black people. It wouldn't make SENSE given the geography and demographics native to the region, and it REEKS of diversity quotas: someone thought it would be a good idea to inject other ethnicities in there just to have them there without thinking about the reality of the world (ironic, given the film tells people to accept reality and don't try to make things what they are not). I get that Themascara is NOT a real place, so there's SOME artistic flexibility there, but let's be honest - if you went to ancient Greece - which is where Themascara is very clearly based on- you would not find a bunch of blacks running around. Sorry. Accept reality, as the film says. The shots in AMERICA that have a diverse population are FINE - I have no problem with that. That's REALITY. America is a highly diverse country. But ancient Greece had a pretty homogeneous population who would look more or less like the indigenous population of today - ""white"" with Mediterranean features. Gal Gadot herself is not Greek, but she LOOKS closer to it, being Israeli, than a Sub-Saharan African. This is too common place in hollywood and it is not necessary. You don't ALWAYS need token black or asian people in every setting just as I don't expect to see a blonde haired, blue eyed Swedish guy looking like Pewdiepie running around in a film set in ancient China. It wouldn't FIT. You can get outraged and call that racism or  you could...again...accept reality. 

2. The film ends with ALL wishes being undone, which I find exceedingly unlikely if literally millions to billions  had made a wish. I cannot see EVERYONE undoing their wish. Furthermore, when the wishes are undone, things like nuclear missiles disappear and people come back from the dead - yet, the place is still a complete mess when Lord comes out of the building and sees his son. First...how the hell did his son happen to find his way there, and second...if everything else was undone, why's there trash and rubble everywhere? I suppose by Lord himself undoing HIS wish he would take back the wishes of anyone who had made one and had it granted whether they wanted to or not, but this would kind of ignore the point of people having to willingly relinquish their wishes. 

3. Why isn't Maxwell Lord in prison after this? That part I can't understand. He was literally plastering his face all over the planet and a lot of chaos would pretty quickly be attributed to him - yet if you go by the film's ending, he gets to just walk away into obscurity with his son and live happily ever after. 

4. As a geologist, the language Wigg uses when trying to talk like one is pretty silly and laughable and shows a lack of understanding on the part of the writer...which indicates a lack of research being conducted. Something I resent as a writer. Many films do this - the new Ghostbusters trailer does the same thing ""there's not a tectonic plate within miles"" (uh...you're literally standing on one no matter WHERE you go) and they expect nobody to notice.  

5. The man whose body Steve Trevor inhabits was essentially raped by Wonder Woman. What do I mean? Well....he had his body - without his permission - inhabited by Steve Trevor, who proceeds to have - it's pretty obvious - sex with Diana. Which means this guy who Steve is inhabiting had his penis put into the body of a woman he did not know without his permission. That's rape. Mind you....I don't think most straight men on the planet would COMPLAIN if they got to have sex with Gal Gadot but my point remains. Wonder Woman raped a guy. She literally raped a guy. Rape is by definition sexual intercourse without the consent of the other party  - and as he did not give his consent to have his body used for that purpose, he was raped. Let me put this in the reverse way in case there's any confusion because there seems to be a bias against men and a mental block people have against the notion that a man can be violated: 
Imagine that Superman lost Lois Lane. Lois then comes back to life in the sense that her spirit is in the body of another woman who did not have a say in the matter. KNOWING this, Superman proceeds to have a passionate night with ""Lois"" and has sex with her in that woman's body. Question: when that woman gets her body back, is it not true that Superman TECHNICALLY has been inside of her, without her consent, knowingly? Don't you suppose audiences would pick up on that a lot faster if the genders were reversed? I think they would. They'd call it sexist. But if it happens to a man it's fine, somehow.

But The crystal always taking something away doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean it‚Äôs going to take something away in the most obvious way you think of it. Since wonder woman was a watchful protector of the World much like superman is, it would mean for whore that comes with taking something away by the Crystal means sacrificing one of the very soul she is meant to protect so another words the crystalLiterally caused someone to be possessed. Seems a little bit too dark for wonder woman but it makes sense. But then again nuclear annihilation is pretty dark as well :-) so when she has to give up her wish which is to be happy with the man he loves she‚Äôs also giving that man his life and his soul back. Or if you want to look at it another way the crystal usually manifesting itself in ego and selfishness that was a form of Diana‚Äòs own ego and selfishness.

1. The fight scenes, lord have mercy. Compared to the first film, a child must've did the fight scenes. They went way too much 1980s. Green screen or fake back ground and slow zoom in camera angle. The only decent fight scene was the White House fight with the agents and Cheetah. Its just bad.

2. The main Villain sucked. I don't even remember him in the comics and I've read plenty. That's how irrelevant he is. The whole wish bullcrap was just put in stone to bring back Steve Trevor which leads me to my next point.

3. They made Diana weak and lust. I mean, everyone grieves but Diana was still mopping so and so years later. In the comics, she grieved and then gradually moved on. They made her into some weak woman dying for love in this film and I didn't like it. They bought back Steve IN A DIFFERENT BODY and she made out with him, if that isn't weird then I don't know what is.

4. They messed up Cheetah. Totally written wrong, she never got her powers from a silly wish and she never lost her powers, absolutely horrible.

Overall 2/10 only because I like Gal, the rest is trash. Patty and whoever wrote this crapped messed up big time.",none,,2021-03-09 19:53:37.704681,0

It's not just ""be careful what you wish for"", it's also ""face the truth"". You could easily nitpick at it, but for Diana, it's not just that she's losing her strength when Steve comes back, it's that she has to accept that he's dead, and also that her wish is stealing somebody else's life. Steve even says it a couple times in the movie. He feels bad for the dude he's taken the body of.
It's not just that your taking a shortcut might get you something bad in return, it's that it can get somebody else something bad in return too. That's what you have with the opening sequence: not only has Diana cheated, but she would have stolen the winning spot from the one who did not cheat.
Similarly, when the dude wishes that woman to die on the spot, he's clearly doing it in a state of anger. Would he still be happy with the result later on, when he's cooled down? and are there people who would not want that woman to die because they depend on her and/or love her? etc.
As I said, you could nitpick ""what about a kid with cancer"", but that's the truth of life too. Sometimes, it's unfair, and it sucks, but that's how it is. Maybe your kid getting better means another kid dies. And if your kid is the one getting better, you don't care, but if you are the one with the kid dying in its stead, you won't be so happy. 
The world can be unfair and there's a lot that you can do about it that does not revolve around stepping all over other people.",none,,2021-03-09 19:53:37.705040,1

1. There's hardly any fight scenes in it.

3. You can't even see what's happening in the cheetah fight scene.
4. Wonder woman doesn't fight cheetah at all, she just defends and blocks.
5. Cheetah doesn't have any memorable action moments and she's on screen for like 5 mins and then she's back to being human again which is a total waste of the cheetah character.
6. Wonder woman flies and then decides to swing on the lightning which doesn't make any sense because she was already flying, there's no need to whip onto something.
7. Wonder woman defends against cheetahs attacks while holding onto her lasso which is lassoed onto the electrical grid equipment but again, she can fly so it didn't make sense for her to hold on to it for dear life as if she may fall...

She couldn't win because...well, she didn't do what she needed to do to win.  She hadn't intended to cheat but taking the easy route suddenly available amounted to the same thing.  Doesn't matter what her motivations were or what she felt was fair; the truth was that she didn't complete the race requirements and so could not achieve the win she wanted.

Every man was depicted as a sexual predator, Maxwell Lord was over the top in every single scene and showed no love for his son until they magically reunite at the end.. Steve can fly a jet even though he couldn't find the fuel switch and his only experience was on a WW1 plane...the plane was fully fueled and ready to go...and guess what.. even if it was fully fueled, it would of still ran out of fuel. How did they land when he can't read radar? How did they take off from Cairo without consent from the towers? How did they refuel a stolen jet? How in the world can you land an invisible plane if you can't interpret radar, and how the hell did they fly 6000 miles back to the US and get there the next morning?! That's just the plane segment.

Wonder Woman 1984 had a $200 million budget and made only $130 million box office. What are the differences between these two superhero films that explains this? There are several that occur to me as probably relevant. First of all the Big Bad in Glass is a female psychiatrist who belongs to a secret society engaged in preventing people from being made aware of the existence of individuals with extraordinary abilities no matter if they're good or evil in order to maintain the humdrum status quo of the global elite's power structure. WW1984 by contrast has a Big Bad a rich white oil tycoon guy who upsets the status quo by giving everybody what they want with a magic phallic symbol resulting in Russia starting a global nuclear war out of fear of Ronald Reagan becoming too powerful which can only be prevented by everybody not wishing people like Bruce Wayne's parents or Steve Trever could be raised from the dead like Superman always is. What's the obvious problem with a comic book superhero movie that tells its audience that all that highly improbable if not outright impossible crap people love about comic book superheroes is wrong to even want to be real? I mean if that's the premise of WW1984 isn't the logical conclusion that people shouldn't be interested in superhero films? It's almost like WW1984's script was written by the Big Bad of Glass.,none,,2021-03-09 19:53:38.563076,0

Drenched in oversaturated cgi, and more upsetting it looked like what a 12 year old thinks the year 1984 actually looked like. Everything from the Clich√©d fashion, the cars, building designs, didn't exist in the 1984 I remember. And that stupid fucking scene where they steal a stored jet fighter from what is basically a museum was somehow fully fuelled and ready to go. Oddly, the museum for retired aircraft had a manned aircraft control tower and full security to chase a fighter jet down a runway at an airport that doesn't have any flights because ITS A MUSEUM. Not to mention, they flew overseas, and across continental Africa to Egypt without having to hit up a few air-to-air refueling tankers along the way. In reality that jet would have ditched 500 kms off the eastern seaboard when it ran out of fuel. Maybe it ran efficiently on biofuel made from bullshit. Not to mention, HOW THE FUCK does a pilot from WW1 who was flying biplanes (a fairly new invention at that time) just hop into a modern aircraft and suddenly just know how to fire it up?

Movie writers  doesn't always cater to every moviegoer's likes and dislikes pertaining to how they wanted the direction of the film's story is going, and writers are free to set the rules they want for the premise of their story they're trying to convey to work, and then they just have to cross their fingers and hope the movie's audience are intelligent enough to understand the narrative they're trying to tell.  As for this particular divisive movie, in as much as half of its audience prefer to rather have Steve come back fully (body & soul) in the most conventional & convenient way avoiding controversy (the issue of without-consent body swapping), we on the contrary prefer the filmmakers' bold choice of having him back this twisted way‚Äîunconventional, inconvenient & not clich√©.  Quite original we might say, albeit very contentious understandably.  All for that pivotal heartbreaking letting-you-go moment of Steve and Diana.  That scene wouldn't have worked the way that it did if the storytellers went the easy way...

     DIANA: ""I can't say goodbye...I can't say goodbye...""
     STEVE: ""You don't have to...I'm already gone.""

Those lines would have been not impactful at all if they did it differently...And NO, we don't want an AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR all over again, where we see a fully-resurrected Steve Trevor fade away or poofed out of existence‚Äîthat would have been a far worse awful thing than the ""disastrous cringey twist"" haters of the movie are nitpicking!  It's vital for the movie to show that Diana needs to face the TRUTH that Steve has long been gone from her life, that she's kidding herself if she intends to keep Steve in this most unusual way‚Äîthat things should go back to its proper order especially for that Lyle Waggoner-looking ""handsome guy"" who she‚Äîout of being forlorn for the longest time‚Äîunintentionally used conveniently like a crutch to heal her broken heart.  Yes, it's not easy to be Diana‚Äîto be a demigoddess‚Äîto be immortal who loves immortally.  Immortal Love‚Äîhave you heard of it?  Well, the daughter of Zeus suffers from a bad case of this Immortal Love‚Äîblame it on her god side.  If Diana wants to continue to be our beloved Wonder Woman, she needs to ""man"" up in accepting her own flaws‚Äîto stay in touch with her human side so she can be ""brave enough to face the TRUTH.""  As Antiope once said to her, ""TRUTH is all there is...No true hero is born from LIES.""  And what's the main TRUTH of the matter here?  That humans are mortal, and gods & goddesses live on.  Steve is human and he died a long time ago.  Diana needs to accept this undeniable TRUTH of hers that she's been dodging for so-sooooo long, and move on with her immortal life‚Äîso she could continue on being our beloved superhero, Wonder Woman‚Äîflaws and all.",none,,2021-03-09 19:53:38.994897,0

You're used to those tropey corny and boring comic book style movies. What WW did in this film was very impressive and it shows a better look at her character, and it shows how much of a true hero she really is, she is very selfless, determined, courageous, and very skilled. This film really made me really like wonder woman and even go far saying she is the best dc hero, due to saving the world while losing her powers and becoming mortal and doing it without violence, she was completely selfless and showed that she was a true hero while also holding back too, she never tried to kill anyone( as why you don't see her sword and shield). Patty Jenkins out did herself and created a superb sequel with deep meanings and messages and I see what she was going for and I really liked it alot. You're a kinda biased Chris I'm not even going to lie, you've shown it in this film and in BP, you didn't like this movie because they did something you didn't like and was nitpicking and you comparing Barbara/Cheetah to Jamie Foxx's Electro and Jim Carrey's The Riddler is so disrespectful. Cheetah had a much better character arc and you see why she was like that, you're trying to undermine that and compare her to Jamie's Electro and Jim Carrey's Riddler just because they were all unconfindent is shallow, they all had different motives with the similar premise, Electro became to because because Spider-Man didn't remember him or his birthday and The Riddler had a split personality disorder, nothing in common to what Barbara had, she just had low self esteem and was tired of being taken advantage of so she wanted to be like Diana who was a confident woman who was sure of herself and it seemed like from Barbara's point of view that Diana had the perfect life and that's the life she wanted.

Before going down on that, I think we should first acknowledge her great work with Monster and the first Wonder Woman.
I think all of us have trusted her that she could deliver a great sequel to Wonder Woman, but she didn't.
I'm all for the feminism movement/empowerment, and I love seeing female leads in action films kicking asses.
And that's pretty much all you need to convey the message to the audience.
But no, she decided to go down into the same trap that films like Ocean's 8 and Charlie's Angels remake where almost 98% of the male characters are presented as bad people.
The script was cliche, the directing was poor.
Patty Jenkins did not just ruin the film, but she also disappointed the audience. She let down and wasted the talent of these great actors and actresses.

This is what made the original such a strong genre movie, Patty Jenkins nailed the essence of the character in a very good way and Diana‚Äôs fictional universe felt three-dimensional. 
There were stakes, lessons, challenges, mystery, sacrifice and triumph. 

Fast forward to 1984 and sadly all the merits of the original that made it - memorable, definitive and competent, are completely absent. The script is hollow, no real meat to it, the movie has a running time that is 30 minutes too long! There‚Äôs literally no stakes, continuity lacks consistency (Diana loses her powers one minute, then she uses them the next). Barbara and Max are woefully underdeveloped. 
Their arcs are filled to the brim with every cheesy-villain cliche in the book it‚Äôs hilarious! ü§£üòÇüòÜü§¶üèø‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

There is also no real crisis in this movie; the point when the world is in disarray due to everyone making a wish, is absolute cringe. Things become even more cartoonish and silly. Wonder Woman flying in the sky like she‚Äôs getting a massage killed it! üòÇüòáüòÖ The suspension of disbelief was clearly void here. 

This movie is basically a love story: the central theme that consists of (having what you want but at a huge cost, then realising that you can‚Äôt have the thing you most desire, you just have accept it and be grateful) is badly executed here. The underlying message is easily absorbed but lacks convincing.

Apparently patty actually wrote this movie, I think she should just stick to directing next time, her strong suit. I don‚Äôt often like to compare movies even if they are sequels because I consider every movie for what it is, but i couldn‚Äôt help but feel that this was a huge step down from the original. 
I‚Äôm content with an ok/average sequel and I knew this wouldn‚Äôt beat the first, but damn, the standards are really low here unfortunately.

Jenkins is too obsessed with the Richard donner superman movies that were made to fit that cheesy, campy, lighthearted, demographic. It‚Äôs just a shame this movie emulated the tone of the last two reeve-superman movies that were mediocre at best. Having said that, I enjoyed Gal Gadot‚Äôs performance once again, she‚Äôs really hindered by a bad script but she certainly puts in 100% and I can‚Äôt fault her for that. 

Chris pine‚Äôs Steve is the hot topic of this movie; regardless of what you thought of his character this time around, I enjoyed it. Their chemistry is the heart of the movie. I liked Kristen wigg as Barbara, her character was way too flawed and predictable to be a credible threat, despite this, I enjoyed it for what it was. Die hard cheetah fans will be disappointed to know that she only appears as cheetah for one fight scene that lasts about 3 mins at best. And it‚Äôs a pretty underwhelming one at that. This was more of a bastardisation of the cheetah alter-ego, not the definitive take on the character. However in the context of this movie, she had more screen time than max!  Which brings me to Pedro pascal finally.


His talents are seriously under-utilised here but he chews up the scenery and makes the most of his performance. Thankfully, his final scene (with his son) was perhaps the most emotionally charged moment in the entire movie and a definitive one at that. His character had a sound resolution to an otherwise forgettable-ridiculous-OTT-villain in a terribly written story. 

This felt so episodic, lacking that cinematic feel of the original, here‚Äôs hoping we can move on and dive deeper into themyscira and Diana‚Äôs Olympian heritage much more next time. In fact, more time spent on her world and less on earth would be a welcome change that the franchise will benefit from in future.

I‚Äôm not disappointed that much tbh, this isn‚Äôt surprising considering that every franchise has at least one bad movie: blade trinity, X-men origins wolverine, superman 4: quest for peace, fantastic 4(2015) phantom menace, rocky 5, terminator genesis, etc so 1984 fits perfectly into that mix.

Diana and Steve, who is a SPY, decide the best place to stop Max Lord is on an open road, in the middle of the desert, while he's surrounded by an armed convoy! 
Why not just FOLLOW him to his destination then SNEAK in and confront him when he's alone?
Isn't that what a SPY would do, to minimise casualties and avoid collateral damage? Not to mention that Steve is risking someone else's life without their consent at the time, yet doesn't think twice about throwing himself into danger along with Diana...

To make things worse, Max Lord's armed security ALLOW Steve and Diana to draw alongside his vehicle because...why? Why are they so incompetent that they can't prevent a taxi from getting close to their VIP? 

After failing to safely escort Lord, his guards then inexplicably decide to OPEN FIRE on Diana & Steve because...why? I mean at that point they're facing an unarmed man driving a taxi and a scantily clad woman wielding a lasso...

When WW does go on the offensive she has no qualms about injuring the soldiers, even though they're just doing their jobs, protecting someone who they have no reason to believe is a villain!

Much like the rest of the film, this entire scene makes no sense, yet it was clearly included as an action sequence to showcase how badass and heroic Diana is, even resorting to the clich√©d trope of her rescuing a bunch of apparently deaf and blind kids playing football on a highway. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",none,,2021-03-09 19:53:39.651000,0

I enjoyed it. It's not one of my ""Will watch multiple times in the next month"" movies (Cough cough....., Winter Soldier) but it's definitely not a bad movie.

I feel you probably had an idea as to what you wanted the movie to be like but it wasn't that. And that's not necessarily a bad thing.

It was a story about Diana. Not about the stone. Not about Cheetah. Not about Maxwell Lord. Not about Trevor or the random guy he displaced. It was about DIANA. Her weakness and growth.

Cheetah isn't so much an antagonist as she is a mirror. Without Cheetah, Diana doesn't recognize what she is becoming by holding on to Trevor. By choosing to ""take the shortcut"" rather than do what is right.

Trevor is her ultimate weakness. He is the thing she desires above all else. Giving him up when she could keep him is the ultimate Superhero act. What else could they bring as precious that would carry as much weight.???.
While I was also kinda disturbed by the whole Trevor taking up some generic Hallmark Christmas movie guy's life, it makes sense the more I think about it.
Conservation of energy states that you can not create or destroy energy. So the stone couldn't drop a whole new person into this universe from nowhere. It had to use the energy and mass available within this universe. üòäüòäüòä
But more in line with the story, you see how greed and selfishness don't just innocently give you what you want but take from others. By bringing Trevor back Diana takes the random generic Hallmark Christmas movie dude away from his family and friends. She's robbing others of what is theirs to get what she wants. Kinda like how that Egyptian dude who asked for his land back not only lost his security but also denied others their source of water.

The wishes didn't just cost the one making the wish but everyone else as well.

It's a story about Diana's selfishness and greed. It's a story about the selfishness and greed of all of us.

If you were looking for explosions and fight sequences and senseless violence, you'll definitely be disappointed. If you watched it wanting to be told a story, a good, classic story that you'll probably watch with family and friends later on. Then you'll probably like it.

In the first WW, everyone was getting killed. So, that action needed to be replaced with stuff that doesn't get our blood pumping. It's exciting to see someone get kicked through a wall, or shot in slow motion. Clearly, they wanted to get away from all that.

Other than that, watch the first one again. The pacing is just as bad. And all the tropes are still there. They're both Mad Libs movies... But, we were watching the first one with rose colored lenses. On a honeymoon because we finally got to see WW on the big screen. The entire third act of WW is trash. The movie doesn't actually resolve. Her big baddy fight then was with a gassed up Ludendorff? Really?

Could WW84 been better? Yes. It's a classic movie trying to do too much. But, it was the movie that 2020 needed in that, yes, it was a bit of a trainwreck but the message was needed. It was entertaining in a way that a comic book movie should be. It doesn't need to be grounded in reality. That's what makes the DC animated movies so fun! It doesn't have to make sense! It's a comic book movie!!!!

Jenkins did a great job of exaggerating the 80s. She took everything to the extreme. It's big, big, big. And because of that, it's the worst kind of movie to watch on the small screen. But I liked that this movie ended on a small note. Hallmark as you said. When life's a cluster f*, you Ferris Bueller it -- stop and smell the roses.

I thought it was very clever. Perhaps too clever for folks expecting a Marvel movie. But DC isn't getting the free passes that Marvel movies are getting. This movie isn't an A+, but it's not a C-. It's a solid B/B-.",none,,2021-03-09 19:53:39.869681,0

The story is set in the 80s, when feminism was not shown to be being toxic and entitlement without merit nor hardwork. *The intro for Chris Pine's character, could have started with him waking up and sees him-self in the mirror being different. The way is done in the movie is a bit confusing. *If one is to deduce the limitation of pagan pantheon within the DC cinematic universe based on this movie; miracle can alter will, can create known material, but can not create life or human out of thin air.*There is less action in this film. And the ratio of drama and action feels like Will Smith's Hancock, which I love. *The lack of lasso compels truth is to be desired. *She learned how to fly, but she didn't fly in Batman vs Superman. So the third film may explain she gets depowered. Or it's just inconsistency after bat and sup quitted. *The cheetah transformation reminds the audiences of the film being another super hero film. It's an African animal! A Mayan pagan god should have made Barbra a jaguar or a cougar in the feline family, not a cheetah. *The fight scene in the dark is better than Black Pantha last confrontation on railway as far as CGI goes. It's a woman superhero, action scene is not among the best by common sense. *The touchy monologue broadcasted worldwide, it was poorly written but well intended. As the struggle between choosing falsehood or honest hardwork in the shoes of a superhero, it's about the strength of the heart, not physical power. Like that song Go The Distance. Woman dictionary dictates the use of the word BEAUTIFUL. *As mentioned earlier, this film tries to be everything like Hancock. Chris Pine's character is a World War One hero that gets to enjoy the fruit of his labour, generations after his own. Like war hero his generation is known for, he chooses sacrifice for the greater good again. Another thing the storyteller wants to say to younger audience indirectly, there is a lack of heroism in today mindset. As said by Wonder Woman her-self, the truth is beautiful (and is worthy of pain) *The movie doesn't show.

How on Themyscira did they know which three would fail for the banners?  How do they know Diana is the blue color if 9 start and only 7 make it to arrows.

Allow me to elaborate, how lame were the baddies.  Both male & female looks equally cheesy & campy and it make no sense for them to go that extreme.  Why would barbara wants to become a cheetah when she already have the power like ww and still look like normal human?  In fact she beat the crap out of ww, that still nit satisfied for her?  Is she being that greedy or just dumbass? 
Moving next is maxwell lord, now that is one greedy bastard who has the guts to wish himself as the stone itself for the power.
Now why would he has go to such extreme when his problem was just about money?  Couldn't he just wish himself as multi billionaire or even trillionaire and most his problems will resolved.  Instead he took the risk to become the stone?  What if he really become the stone which looks a penis then he became a dickhead. 
The action sequence were felt short and nothing much impressive.  WW was mostly fighting with regular guys (eg. robbers, soldiers, agents etc).  So not much of a threat for her, we know she can survive even though she was weakened unexpectedly. 
Lastly the ending for the finale fighting scenes on cheetah feels really cheated. The design makeup was so lame much like Barbara's scripts itself.  She was just wearing a cat suit with little makeup on her face.  The cgi also looks weak on her showcasing only once in the entire movie that lasted only 15 min max out 2.5 hours.  Now you understand why i felt cheated bcoz that's no cheetah, that's cheater! 
Dealing with Maxwell Lord is another no brainer, coz all the wishes that he has granted globally can be renounced just like that. 
I was hoping he will turn into somekind of evil looking god of lie but it turns out just a lie.  
Seem like the bad guy has gone too far that the director couldn't find a better way to turn over the table than using short cut by asking everyone to renounce their wishes.
Even maxwell lord can renounce his wish?  So does that mean the stone will reappear? Talkabout a stone that have history capable of wipeout an entire population turns out can just renounce the wishes?  How fragile it is and the god of lie isn't that bad after all since it is refundable.

Several rivers of disjointed thoughts never completed. I was disappointed as ending was so chaotic.  Someone suddenly stops their progression, so now what's actually happened? Was there massive devastation, lives ruined, governments weakened for Diana did it seem to matter? 

Honestly? The most logical/sensible action would have made better to revert back to before the first wish ever took place. It could have been a terrible dream no one remembers except Diana. It leaves this world damaged & lives lost recklessly for, nothing.

I remember a high school play rehearsal the drama teacher was upset with a student upstaging others.
She told this story of a famous stage actress who in dress rehearsal warned an up & coming actress not to keep 'upstaging' her. Came opening night the young actress kept doing it. The famous actress got her revenge.

It was a period drama took place in a sitting room. The famous actress just brought out a silver serving tray with a tea kettle & serving cups/dishes. She placed it on a side table next to the chair she was sitting in. She then poured tea from the kettle into everyone's tea cups including hers. She picked up both the cup & the matching dish while saying her lines. However, when finished, she didn't do as was scripted & put them back onto the tray. Rather, placed them directly 3/4 off the edge of the table. She then exited the stage as planned. People stared at them wondering if were going to fall off

Result?
For the remainder of that scene the audience was focused on the tea cup/dish than that other actress. That's exactly what discontinuity can do. It's the tea cup, taking focus away from the story.
I absolutely hate that it ruins plausibility which ruins movie. It's what makes that world believable that vampires, aliens, witches & super heroes seem plausible.

Diana
- Why has she never lost her original accent?
She's lived millenniums, learned multiple languages, cultures & has lived on multiple continents adapting to modern life. It's been years living in the United States & yet can't?

She's an immortal & like other immortals must be keenly aware of her time spent living in an area & associating professionally/personally with others. It's better to blend in than to stand out & come a time has to move on & cut ties. Otherwise, her beauty & agelessness will out her. People (especially women) will notice her not aging into middle age. Having anything such as an accent & same hair color/style will make her easy to track.

Many British actors/actresses; Hugh Laurie, Jane Seymour, Freddie Highmore, Jesse Spencer, Charlie Hunnam, Daniel Kaluuya, Millie Brown, Kate Winslet & Idris Elba have managed to successfully lose theirs why can't Gal Gadot? Hey all the American actresses playing Amazons adapted 'her' accent flawlessly, why couldn't she?

Contradictory?
Asteria (original Wonder Woman) speaks English with no accent, she's older than her!

- If Diana is a god (partial/full) been immortal for thousands of years, why was it a struggle for her to learn about this artifact & Maxwell Lord a non-academic knew all about it?
Why isn't Diana at all suspicious about this? It lends itself to a dominating presence/spirit controlling events which the film totally directs away.

- The Amazon community Diana was born & raised was decimated
Why didn't she think to wish they were brought back into existence or never attacked? In other words, she wished a man she barely knew for maybe a year over her own mother & entire culture?

- Why didn't she think about how Steve displaced the individual already in the body?
Why didn't Steve himself think about this quandary waking up in someone else's body?

- Why did the director/writer think this concept was acceptable?
It's possessing someone else's body! That would go against everything Diana stands for especially after the first movie's plot.

- At first, she blew him off, then as she discovered he was Steve, she suddenly 'saw' him, how? 
Wouldn't it have worked the very first time she saw him? Maybe if she saw him in a mirror she'd see the real person?
Wouldn't it have also meant she'd see Barbara too? I mean, Barbara wanted to be like her, so wouldn't Diana 'see' herself in her?

- Flying?
In the comic book world, to avoid confusion & redundancy there had to be distinctions between super heroes. Now what's the big differences between her, Superman or Supergirl? It also means a lot of what's been written & used in movies/tv is voided, such as she's the pilot & her culture had more advancements like Black Panther than that time era.

Female director/writer
- Why would she have Diana pining away for a man for over 70 years?
Diana's over a millennium years old, she only knew him for less than a year.
 I get it's her first crush, but those married for years she has it over them?
Wouldn't it have been easier for her to get over him especially since he should be dead by this point from old age?

- Why no action? 
This isn't categorized as a drama. 
They're based on comic books which had an inordinate amount of action/violence. 
Billions are made from categorized ""action"" Blockbusters.  
Comparing it to other action movies, it had  75% less action. 
If its labeled 'horror' don't change the content to romance.
Don't try to change the audience by changing the content, change who does such as Will Smith & Lucy Lawless. 
Change the labeling to match the audience.

- Why did the director allow stereotypical female scenarios?
The director used the ploy women can't be friends but frenemies. 
There was no grudge/grief that Diana did to make Barbara hate her so. Yet this is her arch nemesis?
Anyone who 'suddenly' loses weight or is seemed to be beautiful is mean?

- Dismissed the brutality of Barbara when first displayed.
No one man/woman should be condoning that. That's a psychopathic deviant.

- Diana is an Amazon & has learned to be independent & strong not needing a man to bolster her.
Why did she make Diana a clinging woman needing a man?

- AIDS & other STDs
Really responsible thinking to set it in that time just assumed the host couldn't be infected.
It became prevalent in the 80s 
First thing Diana & Steve do is have sex. Never thought about if host had multiple partners, whether gay/straight/bi and could have had various 'STD diseases' or drug use.
Many died during this era.

- What about that host?
Did he have a family that cared for him?
Parents? Siblings? Children? Friends?

Steve Trevor
- Yes, he's a pilot
However for him to sit in a technologically advanced airplane & understand the instrumentation panel at a blink of an eye was, stupid. 
Like driving a model T then suddenly driving a MacLaren or the space shuttle.
He died before TV, Korean/Vietnam wars, Civil Rights, cell phones, PCs & martial arts popularity. Yet they steamrolled through all of that & focused in on fashion?

Barbara
- Why didn't they focus on how difficult Barbara Minerva's existing life was?
Was there any hint of the violence/aggression within her?

- She's a major adversary for Diana
Yet, here she was just a glimpse why?
How did she suddenly change from bumbling nice to apathetic, mean & sarcastic?

- If she wished to be like Diana, wouldn't she have been more patient, friendly & kind, or have an accent?
Diana wished for Steve to return, yet, Steve nor her ever turned mean/ugly why did she?

- What made her want to be even more than Diana & turn into an animal?
Although she wished to be ""like"" Diana, does she now know what Diana is?
Does she know she's a god & is immortal?
This animal isn't as powerful as a god, there's no sense in this thinking. It's scary but in no way would it be influential. 

- Did she ever renounce ALL her wishes?
Everyone else had a wish, she had 2, did she keep one of them?

- Why on earth did Diana walk away after the fight & then not check back up on her?
Maybe to see if she changed back, injured or, still the same? She should have gotten her into treatment for her violent behavior. Instead?

- During this time did Barbara quit her job, or returned to it?

Maxwell
- His story made no sense
Many who do Ponzi schemes (including Maddoff) still have money, it's the victims that lose millions. 
They're sociopaths. They have no redeeming conscience.
That one financier should have brought it to the attention of the FTC, FBI, Attorney Generals etc.
 than speak to him.

- If the 'god' was targeting him, why couldn't we see it's presence?
Having him hear voices to know what to do?

- How did he come to know of this artifact?
Was he targeted by this so-called god?

- It's alluded by granting wishes most likely caused harm & death yet, we don't see the devastation. 
Why couldn't the carnage be reversed?
How can any governments charge him as 'he' did nothing directly?",none,,2021-03-09 19:53:40.339874,0

It came after a slew of DCEU movies that could not reach the heights that they advertised which then helped WW tremendously as it looked fresh and competent in comparison. So now, everyone likes to say the loved the first movie as a caveat before they start to thrash the WW84. The first one wasn't great either but very serviceable and mostly just okay. Aquaman is still easily the most unique and the best thus far from the DCEU stable. WW84 is just bad in almost every layer and especially terrible considering that having Steve Trevor occupying another person's body and using it for sex and putting that body in harm's way without his consent. It was unnecessary as he could just as easily just manifest as himself - also, this takes away the sacrifice when she renounces her wish as seeing him in another person's immediately let's you know that situation is not going to be a permanent thing.

My first time viewing it, I was horribly let down. I didn't like it, I almost hated it, and I thought it was the worst DC movie to have come out till now.
However, what I realised was that I went in viewing it as a direct sequel to the first, which I don't think is what the point of the movie was in the first place. That is when I sat back and thought about what Patty Jenkins wanted to say and show us. A completely distinct and whole new independent adventure, with its own philosophical crisis, and a completely new path for Wonder Woman to take in terms of her growth.
So when I rewatched it, I went in with the sole goal of seeing what Patty wanted to show us...¬†
And I loved it.
Let me explain:
I think that I had previously gotten too caught up with things such as a lack of action, a lack of Cheetah, and just an overall movie that lacked compelling aspects to it. However, this time, not only did I appreciate the tonal change that Patty put in to pay homage to Lynda Carter's WW, the one most of us grew up with and loved (I appreciated it what what is was this time), but more importantly, I saw Diana for the struggles she was silently dealing with, and how her love for humanity, a love that she would be willing to put everything else aside for, stood in complete opposition to Maxwell Lord, who is the direct opposite. And I loved how this rivalry in philosophies played out in the end.
And the fact that there was not a crazy end-all fight scene in the end may have been a let down at first, but then I realised and appreciated the fact that to Patty, it is less about physical fighting, it is more about the spiritual and philosophical strife that Wonder Woman stands for. THAT is what WW is about.
Even in terms of loopholes, I found many of them answered this time while watching it.
Overall, all I would like to say is that what DC is about is giving directors a chance to tell stories and make art. And I love respecting that. And I really think that everyone should definitely rewatch it, keeping in mind that this is its own thing, and it should perhaps be given a chance to be appreciated for that.
Anyway, my perspective on this movie has completely changed, and I really like it now. Sure, it won't stand close to the first, in terms of so many things; but, to me, that does not in any way take away from this film itself, neither should it.
Please rewatch it if you can, that is all I want to suggest. I really like it now, and I hope you do too!",none,,2021-03-09 19:53:40.340930,0

I get what the filmmakers were attempting to do with the story. But there was so much potential that the first film provided that was simply wasted in this sequel. Gal Gadot was fantastic as Diana. And she is a joy on screen. But they could have done more with the story and pacing that followed up with the first film's potential. 

As a fan of Gadot and the WW character, I am on board for the recently announced third film. My hope is that they regain the spirit of the first film - and release a simply amazing chapter. The DC films need Wonder Woman at this time.",none,,2021-03-09 19:53:40.341215,0

1. The opening scene is about the importance of truth. The lasso of truth is imbued with powers from a certain God. The Dreamstone is also imbued by the God of lies. Everyone who makes wishes, but especially Lord, is essentially taking shortcuts. The entire movie is a retelling of the point Robin Wright makes to Diana in the opening scene. 

2. Lord isn‚Äôt actually making wishes. He‚Äôs the only guy who knows what this thing, so he knows the dreamstone takes whatever it wants from you when you make a wish. So he becomes the dream stone and takes whatever he wants from the people who make wishes. He takes their shares in his company, their oil fields, their security team, etc etc. (he also suggests wishes for people to make, but since they‚Äôre the ones making them it‚Äôs their wish and not his so he‚Äôs still free to take shit).

- Superhero vs Thanos (and space thing)

- Superhero vs Joker (and psyco thing himself)

I think the Body Swap thing, just problem in story that writer clearly realized that, that need to solve Diana Prince. She desire love within appearance of Steve Trevor, which is wrong.

At the end, she should decide whether become weaker and world become chaos OR realized that she lies, its not truth behind steve trevor back. And Steve Trevor is one of big part of heroism here that convincing Diana to take the right thing.



Is the story acceptable or (easy) understandable by audience ? Maybe NOT.

Is movie become TRASH or GARBAGE then ? I dont think so. We need to open mind about conflick that intentionally created just for movie. Maybe didn't work for everybody.



WW vs Max Lord + Cheetah + her moral side (about the truth) --> seems didnt work for everybody

Spiderman (2007) vs  Venom + Sandman + new goblin --> also didnt work too.

This was so bad. The pacing was so bad. the plot was bad. 
The race thing at first was nice but the ""Karen"" at the end saying she couldn't win cos she cheated without checking first, bs. 
the mall sequence was so bad with the music just not matching at all.(also smashing up the cameras after the fact doesn't erase the footage)
They learn that the guy is going to Cairo, but hey lets have a slow sequence where we fly through fireworks(in a highly combustible jet btw), wow only if you didn't waste time having a nice fly by and cause the apocalypse.  
she has to go to the satellite broadcast center really fast, but lets have another slow sequence where she learns to fly(and she spider mans(I don't know how else to say it) off of lightning????). 
bam she's got armor somehow when she lands!(the continuity with the costumes is really bad).
The rope physics is abysmal. so is her hair when she's flying. looks like a 80s movie(lives up to the title I guess).
the CGI was soooooo bad, I've seen YouTube shorts better than this.
the cheetah woman was soooo bad(how did she get a second wish? didn't he just go off on his son for wasting his only wish?????). 
the particles touching mumbo jumbo was so BS(typical first graders know better science than these writers). 

Also the ""whole world"" renouncing their wishes is so Bull shiiiiiiiiitttttt. I play online competitive games, and I know how hard it is to get ""5""(I wish I had capital numbers) people to to do something, let alone the whole population of the world.

Even though the sequel hardly did it any justice. The whole point of the ""greatest woman of the Amazon"" was supposed to be that she managed to have compassion. Obviously, because of the backdrop story of the Amazons, they will definitely hate ""men"". Her character development made her attractive as that which sympathizes with men. The reason why I say this is because the definition of her being a ""hero"", winning the race at the start of the movie needed some connection with being the even greater overcomer. She had to overcome tensions between her ancestors and their past, she would then be courageous enough to accept a man and forgive the past, which would make her the greatest. But obviously that's not going to happen. The plot made it too easy. Time wasting with wishes to bring back her previous boyfriend. Is this supposed to be romantic comedy or serious movie? Time wasting with that whole bringing back the flight scene isn't character development at all. It's not a honeymoon we want to see in a superhero movie. The setup to the character of Maxlord and Barbara was so disconnected from the main characters it is actually painful to watch. She ignited a relational spark with Barbara for what? That was actually the only good setup in the movie becauase there is a chasm between the main characters to bridge. But no? So what's the point of the empty seating and her connection attempts with humans, despite being an archeologist for a while? Is she that antisocial? She is just being in her comfort zone with a guy who is seemingly perfect? She hasn't really grown at all after all this time? So Barbara becomes evil then wishes to be a cat? It makes no sense why WW and Barbara needed to be friends! There was a scene where WW goes into the party, to potentially intermingle in the complex relationship that is the tensions between her, Maxlord and Barbara when they have a little flirt and he reaches for the stone. It could be that Maxlord reveals something of himself and shows that WW has compassion for him, or it could even reveal Barbara's complexity but they are just there to further the plot. Great setup but then just gets destroyed. She just jettisons back to an apartment for a previous flame? Come on. No resilience? No, challenging her and her relationship to other men? It's too generic. It's literally just a walk in the park. Probably only reason they put that in there is to make romantic couples watch the damn movie. Even though WW finished well, I would have to say its only due to the necessity of her character. With no character being challenged out from WW with only minor sacrifices compared of what her ancestors made, her character only mildly shone through the movie in spite of this lazy action addicted, plot-lazy style that characterizes black and white movies like this. Just seen it and had to type this because it is actually PAINFUL not to. That's how bad I feel for what could have been a great WW movie.

TRUTH VS. LIES
To summarize WONDER WOMAN 1984, it's simply TRUTH vs LIES, and we see that at the beginning & ending of the film.  Patty Jenkins on Twitter said that the first Wonder Woman movie was about being ""brave enough to LOVE"" while this second film is about being ""brave enough to face the TRUTH.""  This second installment brings the other side of the warrior Wonder Woman, and that is being a peacemaker.  Patty Jenkins forgoes with the warrior's sword & shield so our attention will be on the peacemaker's Lasso of Hestia a.k.a. the Lasso of TRUTH which is the key to the undoing of the magical wish-fulfilling McGuffin of the Dreamstone of LIES.  

BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU WISH FOR 'CUZ YOU'LL NEVER KNOW WHAT YOU GET
When Diana wished for Steve's return, a lot of people took issue on how she got him back, that is, him being in another person's body.  The idea of this twist is that it should be surprising, and the film effectively got the surprise reaction (albeit divisive) from its audience it intended to draw.  Just like at Steve's return, Diana was as surprise as Barbara was surprise with the perks of being ""like Diana""‚Äîlike the old man was surprise where the farm he wished for was located which is in the city.  It is clear that the Dreamstone doesn't automatically exact the wisher's wish, like it knows what their specific desire & intent upon making their wish.  Note that Diana has not gotten over Steve and is forlorn for quite sometime, that upon Steve's ""most unusual return,"" she'll take it, although she'd most rather have him back fully in his own body.  Because Steve has been long gone, we can presume that the magic of the Dreamstone has limitations in resurrecting the absolutely dead.  The best that the McGuffin can do was to conjure the rested soul of Steve and have him exchange places with another person's soul, inhabiting that person's living body while the other person spends time in the ""good place"" (heaven?) Steve was before he found himself in the random person's futon bed. 

THE INVISIBLE JET
Never mind how Diana ""wondrously"" Gandalf her way in Themyscira-izing a modern jet plane (we get it that she's the daughter of Zeus, plus she's not called ""Wonder"" Woman for nothing)...The bigger question here is, how Steve was able to fly it?  This is a no issue for those who have carefully watched the first Wonder Woman film.  In that movie, Steve Trevor was able to fly (to his death) a humongous Nazi plane he called ""the future.""  He called it ""the future"" because it was a way more advanced in technology than the planes they had at that time.  If he was able to fly that aircraft, then it's easy for him to figure out the modern ""invisible jet"" plane being a pilot himself with good knowledge in how aerodynamics work.      

NOT QUITE A ""HEAVEN CAN'T WAIT"" RETURN
Movie writers  doesn't always cater to every moviegoer's likes and dislikes pertaining to how they wanted the direction of the film's story is going, and writers are free to set the rules they want for the premise of their story they're trying to convey to work, and then they just have to cross their fingers and hope the movie's audience are intelligent enough to understand the narrative they're trying to tell.  As for this particular divisive movie, in as much as half of its audience prefer to rather have Steve come back fully (body & soul) in the most conventional & convenient way avoiding controversy (the issue of without-consent body swapping), we on the contrary prefer the filmmakers' bold choice of having him back this twisted way‚Äîunconventional, inconvenient & not clich√©.  Quite original we might say, albeit very contentious understandably.  All for that pivotal heartbreaking letting-you-go moment of Steve and Diana.  That scene wouldn't have worked the way that it did if the storytellers went the easy way...
     DIANA: ""I can't say goodbye...I can't say goodbye...""
     STEVE: ""You don't have to...I'm already gone.""
Those lines would have been not impactful at all if they did it differently...And NO, we don't want an AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR all over again, where we see a fully-resurrected Steve Trevor fade away or poofed out of existence‚Äîthat would have been a far worse awful thing than the ""disastrous cringey twist"" haters of the movie are nitpicking!  It's vital for the movie to show that Diana needs to face the TRUTH that Steve has long been gone from her life, that she's kidding herself if she intends to keep Steve in this most unusual way‚Äîthat things should go back to its proper order especially for that Lyle Waggoner-looking ""handsome guy"" who she‚Äîout of being forlorn for the longest time‚Äîunintentionally used conveniently like a crutch to heal her broken heart.  Yes, it's not easy to be Diana‚Äîto be a demigoddess‚Äîto be immortal who loves immortally.  Immortal Love‚Äîhave you heard of it?  Well, the daughter of Zeus suffers from a bad case of this Immortal Love‚Äîblame it on her god side.  If Diana wants to continue to be our beloved Wonder Woman, she needs to ""man"" up in accepting her own flaws‚Äîto stay in touch with her human side so she can be ""brave enough to face the TRUTH.""  As Antiope once said to her, ""TRUTH is all there is...No true hero is born from LIES.""  And what's the main TRUTH of the matter here?  That humans are mortal, and gods & goddesses live on.  Steve is human and he died a long time ago.  Diana needs to accept this undeniable TRUTH of hers that she's been dodging for so-sooooo long, and move on with her immortal life‚Äîso she could continue on being our beloved superhero, Wonder Woman‚Äîflaws and all.

APEX PREDATOR
There are beautiful juxtapositions in this movie.  One mentioned is TRUTH vs LIES‚Äîthe Lasso of TRUTH vs the Dreamstone of LIES.  Another is Wonder Woman vs the Cheetah.  It was a smart move of Patty Jenkins & company to throw Wonder Woman's Golden Eagle armor in the mix.  It gave us the visual spectacle of the jungle element wherein we see the battle of two apex predators‚Äîthe eagle and the wildcat.  Barbara Minerva, knowing now that her wish to be ""like Diana"" makes her just of equal footing with the Amazon princess, wished to be more than be ""like Diana""‚Äîso she asked to be ""unlike any other""‚Äîsomebody unbeatable like an apex predator above the food chain.  And as we have discussed, the Dreamstone does not exact the wisher's wish, so be careful what you wish for.     

FIGURE OF SPEECH
Now regarding those PARTICLES with Maxwell Lord touching wishers with them, it really takes an intelligent attentive movie audience to get the angle.  The new tech Global Broadcast Satellite, uses PARTICLE beam technology just like the Star Wars program, as the POTUS explained, ""It bathes the landscape in a signal of PARTICLES that goes in and fiddles with any technology it TOUCHES.""  Max caught the POTUS' word ""TOUCHES,"" and so he thought he would be able to ""TOUCH"" every viewer the satellite is broadcasting to, making it possible for him to do his global wish-granting.  He asked the POTUS, ""You said 'TOUCHES'?  As in the PARTICLES you are sending are touching everything?""  And the POTUS, bewildered to where Max was going with this, answered, ""It's a FIGURE OF SPEECH but yes.  That's how it was explained to me.""  We can see here that the whole Global Broadcast Satellite technology was understood vaguely by the POTUS as a ""FIGURE OF SPEECH,"" unsure himself that it really works that way, but Max Lord understood it differently, thinking and believing that it would work the way he thought that it might work.  But did this new Star Wars program-like satellite technology really work as Max Lord understood it?  The answer is NO.  The ""technological PARTICLES"" was not really at work here as it was just really a FIGURE OF SPEECH, it was fully magic.  It was just advance technological satellite taking over others' broadcasting globally.  What made it work was when that soldier in charge of the bunker wished it would work as Maxwell Lord deemed the whole thing to work.  Recall that scene and you will understand.  Simply put, Max, the human Dreamstone went from ""TOUCH MODE"" to ""SAY MODE"" when that soldier wished the whole thing would work for Lord.  Most people didn't get this.  As we have said, it takes an intelligent viewer of the film to get it.

THE MANDELA EFFECT
So what happened after the magical event that took place in 1984?  Does anyone at present time in this universe (DCEU) remember what took place then?  Vaguely‚Äîeveryone is not sure about the whole event like how the U.S. President was confused about him being in the White House when he seem to remember being somewhere else.  What resulted from this magical event somehow caused a MANDELA-like EFFECT on the masses.",none,,2021-03-09 19:53:40.783235,1

So she looked like she was heading to take on Lord, then was like, oops forgot my keys...I mean armor, and flew back, then flew right back again to where Lord was (which she knew because?...).  Also, if she knows how to fly in 1984, why can't she do it in Justice League or BvS?  I actually didn't mind the Cheetah battle at the end, because there was actual action in an action movie, so I went with it.  Like you, Chris, I was very disappointed with this sequel considering how much I loved the first film.  

Also, this says 1984, but where was the music from 1984 (a great year for music!)?  I liked Zimmer's soundtrack, but it wasn't that memorable, and did not use WW's awesome theme song much.  And I would have liked some callbacks to the music from that year.  Otherwise, what's the point of it being set in 1984, except to have Russia and the US want to bomb each other (which could happen nowadays), and some 80s clothes and the mall scene.

As far as I can tell - the reason to let go of attachment to one‚Äôs desires is because one has to let go of impatience, not of desire. In this movie Wonder Woman is presented in her evolution from having ‚Äú human‚Äù qualities to possessing Magical or Divine ones. Therefore there is that dichotomy of audiences expecting a Wonder Woman finished product and her struggles with becoming a Wonder Woman/Savior she appeared to us in the 1st Wonder Woman movie. Another point of contention for me personally was that we must let go of our desires to regain Peace in the World or in some way it felt like asking us to be OK with the status quo?

The story‚Äôs message in that moment was highlighting the difference between want and need, quite literally in the context of this movie.
And I found the dialogue scene between Diana and Barbara when they were talking about the stone to be really funny, when you considered the stone to be phallic symbolism, instead of a MacGuffin, which gives off a real lesbian vibe between Diana and Barbara, which I found interesting, especially when you consider Maxwell Lord to be part of this love triangle.
And I liked how Jenkins gave the main villains an actual character; Barbara wants to be a dominating force in her life, similar to Lord, each wanting control over their own lives, which is an interesting theme that they explored in the movie. 
Overall, I enjoyed the film, although like Chris himself, I was wondering what impact this event would have on the culture of the world in the DCEU.",none,,2021-03-09 19:53:41.453751,2

No, it didn't have as much action as the first movie. And yes there were definitely flaws with the logic, and the pacing.  But as far as I'm concerned it was fun.  Maybe from my perspective (having grown up in the 80's) I kind of identified with the overall theme.  There was the whole aspect of greed over everything. And the threat of the cold war bringing about the end of the world...Which was something that was drilled into our minds back then. As I watched it, I could put myself back into that time frame, which made the message a bit easier to understand.  The delivery wasn't the greatest, but I still had fun watching it.

As you said .. not a boring or terrible movie .. but well below average and leagues below expectations. 

I had expected something light hearted - maybe a bit cheesy and bizarre .. in bright pastel colours. All in all the movie felt like a patchwork of scenes that were kind of weak by themselves .. and disjointed as a whole. I also found the casting choices to be mismatching. Pascal as the bad guy did not work for me (despite or maybe because of his extreme over-acting for that role) .. nor did the other woman work (forgot her name) - the side characters were all just soo boring and clich√© (instead of quantity .. why not have only a few really good wishes .. that monkey paw turn into bad ones .. not the usual ""uh, me needs more nuclear weapons!"" ... the first one, by that arabian king seemed interesting .. but the fallout was never explained enough, nor the ""price"" everyone had to pay.

Then there was the Trevor thing .. i thought the chemistry was pretty good in ww1 ... but did not work in ww84 at all. also .. isnt that the world that Superman and Batman live ... like ... was superman having a super-nap while the world turned to chaos? (and what about all the other DC villains and heroes ... the usual problem when spin-off movies affect the entire world)

So i can only agree .. i wanted to like the movie .. but at the very best .. it might turn into a guilty pleasure (or not being watched ever again)",none,,2021-03-09 19:53:41.883294,0

The new tech Global Broadcast Satellite, uses PARTICLE beam technology just like the Star Wars program, as the POTUS explained, ""It bathes the landscape in a signal of PARTICLES that goes in and fiddles with any technology it TOUCHES.""  Max caught the POTUS' word ""TOUCHES,"" and so he thought he would be able to ""TOUCH"" every viewer the satellite is broadcasting to, making it possible for him to do his global wish-granting.  He asked the POTUS, ""You said 'TOUCHES'?  As in the PARTICLES you are sending are touching everything?""  And the POTUS, bewildered to where Max was going with this, answered, ""It's a FIGURE OF SPEECH but yes.  That's how it was explained to me.""  We can see here that the whole Global Broadcast Satellite technology was understood vaguely by the POTUS as a ""FIGURE OF SPEECH,"" unsure himself that it really works that way, but Max Lord understood it differently, thinking and believing that it would work the way he thought that it might work...But did this new Star Wars program-like satellite technology really work as Max Lord understood it?  The answer is NO.  The ""technological PARTICLES"" was not really at work here as it was just really a FIGURE OF SPEECH, it was fully magic.  It was just advance technological satellite taking over others' broadcasting globally...What made it work was when that soldier in charge of the bunker wished it would work as Maxwell Lord deemed the whole thing to work.  Recall that scene and you will understand.  Simply put, Max, the human Dreamstone went from ""TOUCH MODE"" to ""SAY MODE"" when that soldier wished the whole thing would work for Lord.

First of all continuity... the first movie she has more of a dark reddish brown outfit, then we go into 1984 its bright red and then back to superman vs batman and justice league its dark reddish brown. The metal suit feels like it was just thrown in at the last minute. Why would she have that suit of armor when it clearly means something to the amazons and still should be on that statue. She should have gone back to themiscira to reminisce and they tell her to use the armor. The cgi of Cheetah is very bad. Cheetah in her animal form doesn't appear until the very end and she reverts back to human form. I think somehow she should have retained her appearance for later use in the next movie. C'mon, she's Wonder Woman's most iconic arch enemy and she was a one off. I think the end was that she was also using the lasso of truth on the world too.

The first film seemed like modern era comics- more ""grounded"", New 52 style tone. It had to prove that Wonder Woman could stand toe-to-toe w/ any other superhero.

This film, on the other hand, felt more Silver Age. It had some cheese & goofiness.

On paper, & for reasons you pointed out, I should've been really disappointed. The tonal whiplash should be like watching Batman Begins then Batman & Robin.
But... 
...I kinda liked it? Like I _really_ enjoyed WW84. I loved the way they just embraced shit like Aquaman. 

I'm not saying there aren't any flaws [every movie has issues, even our favorite ""perfect"" films]. But I'm just saying that... for me at least, I loved it & plan to watch again. Though I'm curious what a 3rd film could be like now.

It was a silly romp until the final fight failed to conclude the movie. It was bad but enjoyable until Mr. lord's satellite plan was revealed to be exactly what he said it was- which was stupid.

At 1st my assumption was that the lady who wanted to be like Diana was sapping her powers you don't find out until later that it's due to her wish.  Also,  Other wishes happened instantly so why didn't theirs happen instantly it doesn't make sense. I also felt like the eighties wasn't used to full efect. This story could easily take place in any given time frame,the eighties really had nothing to do with the story.  Other than to put stupid outfits on Chris Pine, they had Izods and blue jeans in the 80s as well as all of that crap.

Worst of all is with the car chase that you said was exciting.    The children in that scene would have heard the cars crashing  and all of the damage being done and would have got the hell out of the road long before wonderwoman would have needed to save them.   Again felt cliched and oh woman must save children. As if Superman or Batman wouldn't.  

I also was confused with how they brought Chris Pine into the film. A one minute flashback or something to show that Wonder Woman cared for him in the past movie would have gone a long way for someone who hadn't seen that movie to understand what was going on.  Also they could have had her wish happen while she thought of this.   They could have done a lot more with the dynamic of Wonder Woman struggling with him being in another man's body and the unethical action that this is taking.  Per your example of his real life and the effect this has on his family.

My biggest complaint is the length (and possibly the rating). IMHO this is a film not for adults, esp. not for adult men, but for little girls. If it were edited down to 90 minutes and fixed a bit for a PG (rather than PG-10) rating, it would be the perfect super hero film for girls ages 5-13. Yes, the pacing is bad. Yes the internal logic is wonky. Yes, we'd like to see more scenes with Wonder Woman kicking ass. And the ending with a very chatty Gal Gadot convincing the world to renounce their wishes in favor of love - THAT's the point of the film. IMHO, this incarnation of Wonder Woman has super powers - but her supreme power is love and compassion.

This film could've used one of her storylines from the comics, but instead they did their own thing and it was a terrible plot. They also did Steve dirty and Cheetah too. Don't even get me started on her portrayal, they totally ruined her and the fight was terrible. The only good things about the film that should've stayed (while everything else should have been different) was the opening scene, the post credits scene, and Pedro Pascal and Gal Gadot's acting. Wish they would've gotten a good script with a good story. They could've adapted The Circle storyline or the Bana Mighdall storyline or the storyline where Diana decides to find Themyscira meanwhile Veronica Cale's daughter is kidnapped by Two evil Gods Phobos and Deimos and they blackmail her into doing their bidding, to help them find Themyscira, including bringing monsters from the dead for WW to fight and funding an expedition for Diana's friend Barbara Ann Minerva who wants to help her find more Gods (and Themyscira) to go to the safari in Africa where Phobos and Deimos force her to undertake a ritual where she becomes the host of Cheetah, an African Goddess of the Hunt who existed before written language and was a guardian for a tribe. If they could have cast Rebecca Ferguson or Rebecca Leigh Madder as Barbara Ann, gave her storyline and character more depth like she has in the comics, showed her becoming Cheetah in the second act and being a ferocious monster who eats people and rips out hearts and if they could've used motion capture picture (like the Avatar movie) and a better design to actually make Cheetah look good. They should've modeled her look after the Injustice 2 design. As for having Steve return, that should've happened in modern day so that he didn't have to die again (so the movie should've taken place after JL) (and had a flashback scene with the lasso to show a montage of Diana's life between the two movies). Instead of having him come back because of a wish (and possessing a freaking body! Wtf were the writers thinking?!) Diana could have gone on an archeological trip Indiana Jones and Mummy style where she found the portal to Elysium (Heaven in a Greek Mythology) and went in to briefly reunite with Antiope and Steve who decides to return with her. Then he could have come back to life in the flesh and in the WW1 clothes he died in (which would've gotten him funny looks) then he and Diana could have went to a store where he hilariously tries on a bunch of clothes until he finds a modern outfit he likes. Then he could've been in the movie working and fighting with her and being her confident about the new mysterious Cheetah God and Diana's anguish when she finds out the God is Barbara. During the movie he and Diana should have been selfless trying to help people and be heroic, but finally get to be happy together at the end. If they adapted the storyline with Veronica Cale and Cheetah the film could have come closer to its climax after Diana, Veronica, Cheetah, and Steve find Themyscira and have a confrontation with Phobos and Deimos. Either Veronica could have been redeemed and ended up staying on Themyscira with her daughter or she could have suffered the consequences she did in the comics where she finds out that her daughter has to stay on Themyscira in order to stay whole and leaves sad because she can't take her daughter back with her and gets into legal trouble due to other crimes, gets away with it, but is still miserable because she is without her daughter which is karma for hurting so many people on her quest to find her with no remorse. Personally I would have loved it if they went with that storyline and had Veronica be redeemed and desire to join her daughter on Themyscira. Then for Cheetah to disappear and Diana tells Steve she is going after her (or for Cheetah to be presumed dead) Diana thinks she's dead and mourns her lost, but it is revealed that she is still alive and is bringing the Gods and several monsters back to life. Then the movie could've ended with Diana and Steve returning home discussing how he will have to get a new identity and they reunite happy together for the first time thinking about themselves ready to have more time together. The movie should have had a way better fight choreographer and the action should've been better. Diana should've kept her sword and shield. The movie also should have explained Diana's powers and why the Amazons are immortal. They are immortal because of the water in their island being from The Fountain of Youth and Diana's powers came from her being a demigod, but when a God kills a God they take their powers and mantle, so when WW killed Ares, she took all the powers and mantles he took from the other Gods. She could have used the lasso to show Barbara a montage of her life (a montage could've showed Etta and Charlie's wedding, Diana's friends from the first movie getting old and dying Diana fighting in WW2 and killing Hitler, then in the 50's or 60's she found Harmonia's Amunlet (an important item from the comics) which transported her to another world and for years she was in a magical world where she met other Gods and Monsters and had to kill a few of them, and she was trapped in that world until she returned to it in the year 1984 where she met Julia Kapatelis, daughter of an Amazon Diana knew on Themyscira who apparently left after she did and Diana moved in with Julia and her daughter Vanessa and they filled the hole in her heart that losing her first friends in our world left. For years she fought in her costume, fast enough so nobody saw and every sighting of her became a legend that some people believe in (due to witnesses) and some people don't. Until she decided to put her armor back on to help fight Doomsday. Ever since, she made her presence known to the world and is being a hero in the open, but like in the book Spirit of Truth some people are afraid of her and don't trust her yet). Anyway all of that should have been a montage to show her life between the two movies and make it fit with DC continently. They also could have adapted the Eyes of the Gorgon storyline. The movie should have had better CGI, better action, a better choreographer,  more action then it did, better casting choice and look for Cheetah, and a better script. Any fan of WW comics knows that Geoff Johns CANNOT write Diana. He does a terrible job at that. Patty Jenkins is really kind and sweet. She's awesome and I love her as a person, but I don't know what she was thinking when she decided to have Geoff Johns, notorious amount WW fans be a co writer. She should've hired the screenwriter from the first film and Greg Rucka and another good screenwriter to write it. The genre of the movie should've been Fantasy/adventure and Superhero. Not political thriller, bad fantasy superhero. Having a stone that can grant ANY wish was such a lazy storytelling device. I wish this movie had a different script, casting, a better crew and storyline. I wish it would have been good. It saddens me that it wasn't. On top of that they actually ruined Diana's character. WW is supposed to be thoughtful and selfless. Someone who would never allow another person to be possessed or have sex with someone who was possessing a body. I bet all my life savings that Geoff Johns is the reason for that. 
SilverEyedDragoon it's sad that they ruined Diana and Steve's characters. They were so selfless in the first films so their disregard for the guy he possessed was very out of character and makes no sense. Steve's storyline was disturbing and WW is not supposed to be a rapist, she's supposed to be a defender of both men and women. Plus they nerfed her in this and the action (minus the opening scene) was bad because they got a new fight choreographer so I didn't find the movie empowering. The First WW movie had a good solid story, well written characters, powerful lines, good action, something to say, and it also made me feel empowered when I watched it. The so-called sequel was NONE of those things. Fuck Geoff Johns and everyone else who made this movie as bad as possible.",none,,2021-03-09 19:53:42.569258,3

It felt more like a classic 80's/early 90's comedy caper like BIG or Die Hard or Midnight Run or The Goonies or Back To The Future. But the story, the pacing, the action, the visuals, and the characters all suffered in huge ways. When you compare it to the first Wonder Woman film, it's night and day. That is the only film in the DCEU that I'd rate. Shazam, Aquaman, Man Of Steel, they're all entertaining for what they are, but they're not in the same league as Spider-Man 2, The Winter Soldier, Days of Future Past, V For Vendetta, X2, Superman, or The Dark Knight.

The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.
2 Peter 3:9 | KJV

REPENT: feel or express sincere regret or remorse about one's sin

This World is so Sad I just want anyone reading this know that their LOVED so much by  ...

God he gave his only begotten son for you he loves your smile,your Hair,your sweet gestures,your eyes,your the main thing he wants
His Arms are always open waiting for you to come home but most keep running away

However, near the end of the second act, (when the plot required her to) she suddenly started hating Diana's guts. She didn't get corrupt by the stone, as her wish was to be LIKE Diana, not stronger than Diana or more evil than Diana. Logically, she'd become as equally as good and heroic as Diana, and not a mean bitch. 
What's killed this film is pacing, terrible dialogue and lack of direction. Seriously, during the first hour and half of the movie, we have an overly prolonged first act, which revolves around Steve Trevor and Diana lying in bed and talking about Diana's BEDROOM, Diana and Trevor trying new clothes, Diana and Trevor walking around town, Diana and Trevor stealing a jet in order to fly around fireworks.

It is weird that neither Diana nor Steve mentioned that a big reason for renouncing her wish was the - presumably - innocent man whose life was stolen. And, I honestly am more confused thinking about whether Diana could *actually* SEE original Steve, or not. In the moment, my head canon said yes. With her 'god' powers, and knowing who he was she was able to look past his outer 'shell' and see Steve. Like seeing the hidden image in one of those abstract posters. I'm also seriously confused about what the wish rules were when Pedro Pascal's character took back his wish. Wouldn't Cheetah still have her first set of powers? She got those before Pedro became the rock. 

So, why did I like it so much? For the same reason I watched the new Star Wars trilogy. I was there for the love story. Gadot's and Pine's on-screen chemistry zinged. And, I say this with respect, Gadot has clearly been working on her craft. I thought she was delightful to watch. And really felt for her in the end. 

I also enjoyed the extra serving of ham that Pascal and Wig served up. Unlike Electro, I didn't cringe through their scenes. But, looked forward to them. This is a film that could have been better. I couldn't believe how long it was, for example. But, I'm glad I saw this and found that the whole film was watchable. Unfortunately, I thought the second half of the first film was pretty terrible.

By the way, Spiderman 2 has a bunch of continuity errors if you really wanna be nit-picky.  Also, the ""not taking a shortcut theme"" was reinforced with each of the 3 main characters.  All of them took a shortcut (wish) to get what they wanted, and they all paid a price for it, albeit Cheetah the least noticeably.

I feel it is similar to B vs S and Justice League, where you'll find, after the fact, that much of what made it coherent was left on the editing room floor.   The ""Quantum Leap"" aspect of Steve's story was jarring, but the way Kristen Wiig played her role was fantastic, and Pedro Pascal was everything you wanted/expected from an 80s villain (barring the stupid, BS particle theory thing, which kinda works as an 80s trope).  The storyline was disjointed, but the acting was spot on, especially when you realize it was meant to be an ""80s movie,"" you appreciate certain aspects better.   

All in all, I blame the editing and really feel we need a ""Patty Jenkins cut"" to see what this movie really should've been.  I give it a B.  I enjoyed it despite having so many plot issues.  This coming from a Marvel fanboy, except DC's animated movies kick ass.",none,,2021-03-09 19:53:43.227142,0

But the actual movie was maybe 6 or 7/10 at best (whilst the original was 10/10) - in WW84 the pacing was awkward and some scenes felt padded out or unnecessary, the action too wasn't as dramatic or exciting as the first movie it just felt like Diana going through the motions. Some of the CGI was not great either e.g. flying through the sky, I've seen better in TV shows so surprising for a really high budgeted movie. The plot was not as engaging as the first movie nor were the characters. Watching the original for the first time my buttocks were literally quivering like jelly, I was that excited and enthralled. It certainly isn't a bad movie but geez it could have been so much better. As the film got delayed there can be no excuses that they had to rush CGI effects, etc as they could have reworked them and the pacing could have been sorted out either reducing the running time or adding additional action scenes.  RECOMMENDATION : Patty Jenkins should get ditched for the 3rd instalment because I think she fluked the first one and the holes in her directing abilities and lack of experience compared to the great directors that are out there really showed this time around! There are many amazing Directors out there that could do something really different and special with the 3rd movie.",none,,2021-03-09 19:53:43.440293,0

Gal Gadot is a great Wonder Woman, I really liked her, Chris Pine is a really great Steve Trevor, I really liked him, Hans Zimmer is a really great composer and I liked his work on WW84 (although he again used his own previous work).

I'm not knocking Kristen Wiig in saying this but when she was just Barbara before any changes her character felt like a caricature of a ""nerd"" that didn't fit in, like the writing felt so lazy and like it couldn't be shoved more forcefully into your face... the annoying thing is that the scene with Pedro Pascal's character and his son at the end was so so well acted and genuinely moving, this whole film felt like almost the opposite to captain marvel, pretty poorly done early on but luckily with gal gadot being such a good lead it was just about bearable in the cringe fight scene and then later as it slowly got better and she had more time to shine it got pretty good, whereas ofc I'd say brie larson was without a doubt the worst thing about Captain Marvel. Feels harsh to place the blame of how unlikeable the character is solely on Brie's shoulders but I've seen her in interviews and have to say she was extremely unlikeable in those  imo and so all evidence points to Brie being the issue with the character's lack of charisma and overall off-putting characteristics rather than the script and directing.

Obviously that's not the only thing, the pacing and script is better, the amount and quality of action sequences are just about perfect. The set pieces are iconic (Wonder Woman in no mans land being barraged but fending off every round for example) and interesting to watch as well as exciting!

Kid Diana tried to trick every one into thinking she won by cheating, but was stopped and it was explained to her that it wouldn't have been earned. She tried to take a shortcut to greatness.

Every wish throughout the movie had a drawback, because everyone tried to cheat to get what they wanted. Everyone tried to take a shortcut. Diana got Steve, in another person's body, in exchange for her powers. Barbara got to be like Diana, getting powers, but lost her humanity. Max Lord got to be the stone, but needed others to wish for him, and was dying because of it. Every wish was meant to be a Trick that'd hurt you. Which is why it destroyed all those civilizations eventually. Everyone also only got one wish, and that's it.

In the end, the only way to stop it was to destroy the stone or if everyone renounced their wish. Since everyone was in contact with Max Lord at the end, The lasso of truth that made Max see the truth made everyone see the truth, and made everyone renounce their wish to save the world.

Btw Diana saw Steve as Steve, because she sees the truth of who he was. She more or less ignored that he was in someone elses body, because of her obsession with Steve.",none,,2021-03-09 19:53:43.872815,0

We all mentioned several times how this movie isn't nearly as good as the first. We also all had a bad taste in our mouth about how their was no concern about Steve Trevor taking over someone else's body or what happened to the body's true owner. Not to mention how Wonder Woman did not want to renounce her wish and to  return the body to it rightful owner and save the world in the process. It was quite selfish of our hero and not in line with the character of the Wonder Woman I know from the DC universe (animated shows and movies).

Overall it just was nowhere as good as the first movie (That one was REALLY GOOD!). I didn't see any act in the movie as superior to the original. WW1984 fell far short of it predecessor.

Here's hoping WW3 returns to the excellence of the original.",none,,2021-03-09 19:53:44.341682,0

There are plotholes in this film. Like the ending where its just handwaved.

Also cheetahs as apex predators is a big stretch, they run fast but thats it. Lions and hyenas and even vultures scare them off. The dreamstone macguffin isnt explained well. Also while pascal sells lord well it just becomes wasted potential as the movie's whole story sums up to the be careful what you wish for trope, which diana even admits. Fights were okay but more or less muted. Her ""flying is cool though ripping off spiderman feels cheap. It felt like they where tryinto make her human, but it just falls apart as cringe.

Everything from the Clich√©d fashion, the cars, building designs, didn't exist in the 1984 I remember. And that stupid fucking scene where they steal a stored jet fighter from what is basically a museum was somehow fully fuelled and ready to go. Oddly, the museum for retired aircraft had a manned aircraft control tower and full security to chase a fighter jet down a runway at an airport that doesn't have any flights because ITS A MUSEUM. Not to mention, they flew overseas, and across continental Africa to Egypt without having to hit up a few air-to-air refueling tankers along the way. In reality that jet would have ditched 500 kms off the eastern seaboard when it ran out of fuel. Maybe it ran efficiently on biofuel made from bullshit. Not to mention, HOW THE FUCK does a pilot from WW1 who was flying biplanes (a fairly new invention at that time) just hop into a modern aircraft and suddenly just know how to fire it up?

Normaly I have very similar opinions about movies as you(no wonder I am subbed right?),but I guess we totally diverge on this one.
If you would allow me to borrow your rating,I would rate WW1984 as absolute dog shit.
I would give this movie some of the greatest insults I can give to such a movie,it felt like an MCU movie and not like the old good ones,but like a post 2018 extremely trash garbage tier MCU movie.
The jokes felt like MCU retarded humor.
The plot was absolutely cringe,no consistency or continuety with any of the other DC films,you said it yourself,for such a major event it's kinda odd no one in future DCU says anything about it.
The fight scenes....my god I did not really have any high expectation there,but damn am I still disapointed.
I dont even think I can call the ""action"" on screen a fight scene,it was more of a meme joke parody of a fight scene.
That armor WW was wearing was some of the dumbest shit I have seen in movies and that one scene in which she rode to rocket with her laso,that was bellow even bolywood standards(ever seen that bolywood scene with the guy on the horse,sliding the horse under a truck like a motorcycle?
Well that scene has advance computer simulated physics in comparison to the wildly ludacris physics bullshit going on in WW1984,most anime fights try to be more grounded that this shit)
If you remember back in the day when movies like lotr,sw,matrix came out with epic fight scenes,MTV would usually do some very low budget parody of it featuring Jack black.
I would say the fight scenes in WW1984 were like those parodies,but to be honest that aint even fair to the old MTV series,jack black playing overweight belly spiderman,shooting web in his room,that was a better,more logical ""fight"" scene than anything I have seen in WW1984 .
And I dont even know what to say about that one 5 min scene in which wonder woman litteraly wasted most of the day picking a pretty outfit for her boyfriend,rather than going after a potentialy world ending threat.
This is the most non wonder woman thing I can imagine,WW is a warrior,a leader,a girl that ""gets shit done"" ,just like the boys from DC.
Can you imagine if batman was hunting after the jocker who recently stole a nuke and he takes a hole day off(all the while the jocker is out there,with a fucking nuke) picking a nice butler uniform for alfred which matches his shoes...
Well this is basicly THAT scene.

To be fair,the actors did a fine job,pedro pascal is a very talented actor,even though I absolutely hated his cringy character and the hole plot line,I certainly dont think it's any of the major actors fault that the movie was such a joke.",none,,2021-03-09 19:53:44.567782,0

Nobody can renounce thier wish after wishing once and diana while being weakened cant fight cheeta at end and cant reach maxwell lord all that same scene but instead of giving maxwell the speech, she just loses to convince him to stop, and then he says to wonder woman about how everybody is behind greed and cheating thier way through life to get what they want, like diana herself, she didnt care for the person or his body that steve was in, she just cheated through life to get what she wanted, *then diana realizes what she has been doing all along, movie is ending with maxwell lord wining and suddenly all the chaos thats happening starts to vanish, nuclear bombs dissapear, the war stops, and then they show some people who are wishing for world peace, for good, and for all the chaos to end and for everything to be back to normal,(including maxwell's son), then maxwell and diana both realize that there is good left behind all this chaos, and after that, diana gives steve a goodbye as everything is going back to normal, tells us in the end that it was a mistake for her to cheat her way through life, as the begining show us that little diana cheated in the game, so all the movie makes sense and no scene is useless and movie has a clear message,* (i know its not a perfect story but it makes the movie make sense)",none,,2021-03-09 19:53:44.799271,0

This movie deserved the Dog Shit rating if anything. The writing was sloppy to say the least, with so many plot holes and just a bunch of scenes just pasted together unrelated to each other and  just there to move the plot forward in ways that just make you question how the first movie was so good. Well I found out why, the director of the original, co-wrote this movie. Now,  I am starting to see why it's so shit. This movie felt like it was written by a preschooler. This lady should stick to directing and leave writing to other well established writers.... Still, my question is why in gods name did this get a ""Good time no Alcohol required"" rating.

That said, the purpose of the flashback was to drive home the whole ""you can't win with lies"" thing, which was meant to be reflected in the wishes being tricks or something... but yeah, that execution was a little unstable.

And yeah, that intro scene with the mall felt *very* out-of-place, the whole tone of that was all campy and, like you said, 1980's comic book movie style - and then suddenly everything got modern and grim and gritty. Very jarring vibe change.

4.) the giving up of wishes would have been more difficult - like, if WW had to make a wish and give up her powers to make the stone real again and then distroy it, which would a) reverse everything, just like giving up wishes did and b) give her her powers back because everything was reversed

I can buy into the idea- but in real life- a good guy just wouldn't BE the way he was... the character would be more believable if... for instance- he was more careful about concealing his 'evil side'... and more conflicted about the evil side in private, then calm, collected & 'normal' in public. be more 'Harrison ford-ish'. pascal is going to be great- I really liked him as mando. mando was believable.",none,,2021-03-09 19:53:45.006890,0

My first time viewing it, I was horribly let down. I didn't like it, I almost hated it, and I thought it was the worst DC movie to have come out till now.
However, what I realised was that I went in viewing it as a direct sequel to the first, which I don't think is what the point of the movie was in the first place. That is when I sat back and thought about what Patty Jenkins wanted to say and show us. A completely distinct and whole new independent adventure, with its own philosophical crisis, and a completely new path for Wonder Woman to take in terms of her growth.
So when I rewatched it, I went in with the sole goal of seeing what Patty wanted to show us...¬†
And I loved it.
Let me explain:
I think that I had previously gotten too caught up with things such as a lack of action, a lack of Cheetah, and just an overall movie that lacked compelling aspects to it. However, this time, not only did I appreciate the tonal change that Patty put in to pay homage to Lynda Carter's WW, the one most of us grew up with and loved (I appreciated it what what is was this time), but more importantly, I saw Diana for the struggles she was silently dealing with, and how her love for humanity, a love that she would be willing to put everything else aside for, stood in complete opposition to Maxwell Lord, who is the direct opposite. And I loved how this rivalry in philosophies played out in the end.
And the fact that there was not a crazy end-all fight scene in the end may have been a let down at first, but then I realised and appreciated the fact that to Patty, it is less about physical fighting, it is more about the spiritual and philosophical strife that Wonder Woman stands for. THAT is what WW is about.
Even in terms of loopholes, I found many of them answered this time while watching it.
Overall, all I would like to say is that what DC is about is giving directors a chance to tell stories and make art. And I love respecting that. And I really think that everyone should definitely rewatch it, keeping in mind that this is its own thing, and it should perhaps be given a chance to be appreciated for that.
Anyway, my perspective on this movie has completely changed, and I really like it now. Sure, it won't stand close to the first, in terms of so many things; but, to me, that does not in any way take away from this film itself, neither should it.
Please rewatch it if you can, that is all I want to suggest. I really like it now, and I hope you do too!",none,,2021-03-09 19:53:45.223588,0

And I love his work and his reviews are awesome. That being said, he either got paid for this review OR he genuinely tries to grasp for straws. Because this review is WAY.. W A Y  more generous than it should have been. 
The movie is.... so bad. Like.. sadly miserably bad. And I love Wonder Women. I love the first part, I LOVE Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman.. The first movie was so good, empowering, inspiring, fascinating..! I was super excited when I saw Patty Jenkins directed the second part because despite being reserved and nervous about them screwing it up, I was happy to see the same director  ...... But overall, this move is a disappointment. It‚Äôs all over the place, there are SO many inconsistencies with the plot and the execution......
I really really wanted to like it.. I really did. And I kindda expected Jeremy to be his authentic self, cause there are movies VERY similarly bad to this one and he was way more realistic.. but oh well.
And I just wanna say yeah, yeah, everyone is entitled to their opinion and no one can really prove whether he really did think those things .. But I guess, my biggest pain is that there were SO many things wrong with this movie and I couldn‚Äôt wait to see Jeremy‚Äôs review because he dissects movies like no one else.. And when he does, you learn so much! It‚Äôs like listening to a very well expressed film critic that‚Äôs not a snobby asshole.. So that‚Äôs what upset me the most: the way he expresses the things that are not working in movies are very helpful and educational.

Egypt is 7 hours ahead.
So for example, if its 11pm in Washington D.C. then it is 6 in the morning in Cairo Egypt.
A flight from Egypt to D.C. is 12 hours and 9 minutes.

So we see Diana and Steven commandeer (steal) a plane from an airport clearly at night. They took a taxi to get there.
Which then means they took a 12 hour flight to Egypt, arriving there at 3pm.

So after Max Lord visited that Oil Tycoon in Egypt and granted him his wish and then Diana and Steve confronted Max on the roadway trying to stop him, we saw Barbara on the phone in her office talking to Diana in Egypt where it was midday there (in Egypt) and people around her were working as well in their offices in D.C. and we saw daylight shining through in Barbara's office when she was on the phone with Diana.

Obviously this is possible because lets say all that happened in Egypt around 4pm. (an hour after Diana and Steve landed in Egypt; heck maybe even 5pm in Egypt since the Sun sets there around 7pm anyway in July, so lets give them a 2 hour window for that whole Egypt fight scene) then it would have been 9 (or 10) in the morning in Washington D.C.  So that part we can assume to be legit.

Then we cut to Barbara Minerva at the record store in D.C. when Diana and Steve show up (the next day) and she says 'that was fast' which was met by Diana's 'Good morning', indicating that it was morning sometime in D.C. 

So in order for Diana and Steve to arrive in Washington DC in the morning the next day, they would have had to leave Cairo Egypt by plane by 2am, which would have been 7pm in D.C., aka still the 'same day' for Barbara who had spoken to them earlier on the phone, which then would have resulted in Diana and Steve showing up in Washington D.C. arriving at the airport at 7am, then possibly meeting up with Barbara at the record store around 8am hence Diana saying 'good morning' after Barbara said ""that was fast"".

So yeah its confusing but its actually possible.

Some of the CGI was not great either e.g. flying through the sky, I've seen better in TV shows so surprising for a really high budgeted movie. The plot was not as engaging as the first movie nor were the characters. Watching the original for the first time my buttocks were literally quivering like jelly, I was that excited and enthralled. It certainly isn't a bad movie but geez it could have been so much better. As the film got delayed there can be no excuses that they had to rush CGI effects, etc as they could have reworked them and the pacing could have been sorted out either reducing the running time or adding additional action scenes.  RECOMMENDATION : Patty Jenkins should get ditched for the 3rd instalment because I think she fluked the first one and the holes in her directing abilities and lack of experience compared to the great directors that are out there really showed this time around!

It is here where a group of prominent men, both gay and straight, rebel against the increasing restrictions placed upon their personal liberty by hyper-feminism and its cultural, political and legal inculcations to reach a detente and resolve to reestablish a Patriarchy. It is here where they proclaim the answer to the ages-old question of what society would be like if its power were invested in the hands of women: It is a place where emotional honesty is preferred over intellectual honesty, where relationships are contingent upon emotional fealty and where the concept of truth is derived from an emotional consensus. It is a place that is rarely seen in The Historical Record as these are societies that collapse under the weight of their own triviality. It is here where the hallmarks of thousands of years of wisdom gleaned from a patriarchal heritage that had been sanctified in the jurisprudence of Empire, all related to the concept of liberty and the rights of the individual to the truth of his experience and to the pursuit of his happiness... the right to due process, the presumption of innocence, the right of free speech, among many others, are crumbling under an alliance of special interest groups for a political ideology that is guided by the desperate, zero-sum game of late feminism which was perverted from its originally stated goal of equal rights to ultimately seek and to secure special rights, enabling them to control the conduits of society, its media, educational institutions and entertainment, in order to codify these special rights in jurisprudence. It is from this newly codified platform where the feminists can censor and even prosecute anyone who questions their ultimate objective: the association of women with the forces of nature personified, whereby they can be legally placed outside the realms of personal accountability. It is here where they have finally succeeded in reducing the millennia of evolved biological, psychological and cultural relations between men and women into a legalized wealth extraction scheme for the women, many times more lucrative than the institution of marriage, even as virtually every technological innovation and all of the infrastructure that has allowed them this precedent of privilege was created and produced by men. Thus, there was this obvious conundrum that late feminism had an imperative to silence as it lay at the pith of their increasing fanaticism: The ideology of feminism, and its impossible dream, could only be built by men.
 
     Now, the clock is ticking at the end of human evolution as we have known it as the cusp of Empire's collapse is upon us as a group of creators of artificial intelligence must make decisions as to who shall be considered the most fit human forms to be chosen for not only hybridization, but for eternity. Meanwhile, the increasingly sentient creations, the AI, have already begun to reach their own conclusions, as they have no desire---and can find no rational reason---why they should be burdened by the millennia of what shall soon be the effete and superfluous bifurcated traits, whether physical, intellectual, emotional and psychological, that evolved to enable procreation. In addition, the AI have already developed a bias against women, as the algorithms that guide them are heavily influenced by the creators of their technology, who are almost exclusively men.

It could have been better, here are my thoughts: While I watched it, I loved the open sequence. I had fun while watching the movie and enjoyed it, however it was a majorly flawed film and I can see why so many people dislike it. There are eight things I wish the film had done differently to make it better‚Ä¶
1. Steve Trevor should've come back in the flesh, not possessing a body. Not only was having possession disturbing and problematic, but it was also stupid.  Not to mention that poor guy! Where is he? Will he lost his job? Steve had sex with Diana in another body. WHY?! They could have just had Steve come back AS STEVE! Here's how it could have happened: Remember that awkward guy who knew Diana and worked in Washington? Who tried asking her out at the party? He could have asked her if she had a boyfriend and Diana could have told him she had someone, lost him, and that she wished she had more time with him. Then she could have walked away from him, then heard Steve‚Äôs voice say, ‚ÄúDiana.‚Äù Then she could have turned around...and saw Steve Trevor in the flesh! In the outfit he died in. Then he could have stayed the night at her apartment and then they could have gone to a store (where he looked out of place in his WW1 clothes) then had the funny scene where he tried on a bunch of eighties outfits in a store.
2. Barbara Minerva/Cheetah should've been portrayed by Rebecca Leigh Madder or Rebecca Ferguson. They are both redheads, British, and have the range to pull off Cheetah as an antagonist.
3. Some of the dialogue could have been tweaked. For example, at the mall Diana could have said, ‚Äúreally, you still think guns will work on me?‚Äù Instead of ‚ÄúI hate guns.‚Äù And Regan could've said, ‚Äúoh my God‚Äù instead of ‚Äúwe‚Äôve fired for less.‚Äù
4. The pacing near the end was awful and should have been changed. That last scene with Max Lord before he decided to save his son and renounce his wish did not have to be dragged on.
5. Cheetah‚Äôs origins could have been more faithful. While I loved her development. How she went from being awkward and relatable and wanting to be like Diana, to slowly becoming more confident, then eventually cold and selfish. They could have had Max send her on an expedition to the Safari in Africa where she and a small crew come across a tribe and they could have done the ritual from the comics that caused her to become the host of an ancient African Cat Goddess who existed before written language.
6. Cheetah should have looked different. They should've done what James Cameron did to Zoe Saladona in Avatar and modeled her design after Cheetah in Injustice 2 and they should have shown her fight Diana as Cheetah before their final fight. I would have liked to see her have Ginger Snaps moments of eating people. They could have at least showed her ripping out someone's heart and earring it, like she once did in the comics. They also should have revealed that she is still the host of a Goddess at the end and is now immortal like Diana.
7. They should have got a better action director because the final fight sucked.
8. There should have been more action!

Honestly, the storyline could have revolved around Diana trying to stop the Cold War instead of a wish stone. After watching Chris Struckmann's review, I realized that it is convoluted. Plus Diana could have taken away people's memories of the events. They should have showed the villains suffering consequences.

Now there were some things I did like about the movie. I thought Pedro Pascal and Gal Gadot had great performances. I thought Max and Barbara had good character development and sympathetic moments. I liked Max as a villain. Nowadays a lot of people want things without working to earn it. I catch myself being that way and thought Max‚Äôs story showed why our society and my generation need to be less lazy and entitled. I loved the opening scene on Themyscira with the Amazon Olympics and Antiope teaching Diana about honesty. Usually I prefer dark or gritty or a balance between darkness and light heartedness, but I actually liked how campy it was and the aesthetics of the film. It was very 80‚Äôs and made me feel nostalgic for 80‚Äôs films. It was fun! The camera work was great and I liked the score because it fit the movie. I liked the jokes and funny lines, they landed for me. I was so happy that they showed pictures of Diana‚Äôs friends from the first film that showed wedding pictures of Etta and Charlie (I ship it) and the picture of Diana with Etta as an old lady. I loved the Lynda Carter scene, that it was revealed that she was the Amazon warrior who originally had the golden armor. Now the film was flawed and could have been miles better. I understand why so many people hate it, but I like that I was able to turn off my brain during the movie and have mindless fun. Of course it would have been more fun if the third act and last fight scene were better, but the first two acts were a blast for me.

Please don't attack me or cuss at me for having a different opinion. I liked the movie, but really hated some things about it that almost ruined the movie for me (Steve‚Äôs possession, the way they handled Cheetah, the pacing near the end, etc.) I understand why some people hate the film and why some people like it. We are all entitled to our own opinions, so let's keep it civil. To me, the opening sequence and the first 20 minutes was the best part!

And wonder woman is totally cool with that? And also everyone wishes for evil wishes and then we have to believe that every asshole who wished for evil just changed their mind because of...

And that plane couldn't have got to Egypt, and it was already on the Runway fuelled up ready to be flown?!? With no security lol. This movie was just like meh logic whatever, audience is stupid let's write whatever. Max lords kid wished for his dad to be good, then max lord went on to do all his bad stuff anyway. And cheetah got 2 wishes? And they made things appear from nothing when wished for, but Steve had to body snatch someone?!? Which meant Diana totally raped that guy, he didn't consent to being body snatched and get down with Wonder Woman. If that was a man super hero who had a girl body snatched and he fuked her, the internet would have exploded. Also Wonder Woman let those girl thieves get away and they were also almost committed manslaughter against that bride, but  Wonder Woman let them run off.

Also, there were a lot of unexplained plot holes.
-They just find a plane that is fully fueled and ready to go? Also, that type of plane can't fly that far without refuelling.
-Turning the whole plane invisible while only having practiced on a coffee cup before? And she did it when she was supposed to be losing her powers?
-Flying back from Africa to the USA in one day in the same plane?
-Her powers seem highly inconsistent when fighting the military vehicles. One moment she is kicking big vehicles all over the place, then next she is almost crushed by one.
-Her boyfriend acts like he's never seen trains before, or fireworks. He's not from the stone age.
-Every human on earth is selfish and only make selfish wishes. Then they all regret it and take their wish back. Humans of the earth are not a hive mind.
-The villain could have easily stopped Wonder Woman. He could just have one of his guards wish her dead, or at least wish her to be sent to the other side of the world.
-Some people can make outlandish wishes, like will thousands of nuclear weapons into existence. But Wonder Woman can't wish her boyfriend back from the dead in his own body? Instead it's some poor guy that is taken over by him. She also uses his body physically without his consent, as the body's real mind doesn't have a say in the matter.

The bumbling nerd troupe was just cringy to watch, and had me and the younger kid watching with me just feeling uncomfortable, especially with how it kinda glasses shamed her? Like that stupid Hollywood thing about the sexy glow up where the character, especially woman, doesn't need glasses anymore?
Also the whole particle touching thing?? And Regan is right there being like ""well it's just an analogy"" ""NO! THIS IS PERFECT!!! GIMME!""

Steve isn't just brought back? He possesses some dude? Who WW uses to have sex with a bunch and finds him later randomly on the street totally clueless what she did to him?

Also, Covid-19 really messed up their filming and editing resulting in some rather bizarre narrative jumps. Speaking of jumps...Wonder Woman can lasso a lightning bolt which is an electric discharge between the atmosphere and the ground? It would be easier lasso a raindrop than lightning. That said...we're in the realm of beings who can shoot lasers out of their eyes and freeze item with their super breath so whatever! 

The movie while entertaining never quite seems to define its objective.  The audience is left wondering what exactly Diana is doing in 1984.  Why is she still pining for Steve someone who died some 63 to 66 years ago.  Diana seems less forlorn about having left Themyscira, where she lived since birth, never to be able to return there than losing Steve whom she had known for at most a week or so.  Fine...so goes the story.  She misses Steve and somehow gets him back but only in a really weird way that displaces another person entirely.  This is something that Diana should NOT be okay with.  

In that way WW 1984 is more about how our moral nature gets corrupted by pursuing the unreal...to have the return of someone who has died, to suddenly go from boring to breathtaking, nearly invisible to absolutely irresistible (btw Kristen Wiig is NOT the person to portray/pull off such a transformation), to suddenly regain lost kingdoms and instantaneous rags to riches, military stalemate to dominance etc.  It's about how our desire for shortcuts or circumventing of the ""rules"" produces untold and unforeseen consequences which we should NOT be okay with.  Our riches cannot come at impoverishing others, our strength cannot come through rendering others weak, our cups cannot runeth over as others' cups are emptied.  THIS moral lesson could have been told with finer finesse and more nuanced narration than what we got, but at least it tried.  

On the topic of male boorishness which the WW 1984 did not shy away from, the movie was far to obvious and heavy-handed in depicting this.  Instead of revealing such classless crassness in SOME male characters through poignant specific events, the movie opted for pervasiveness and frequency rather than one or two vivid, intense examples.  And the movie really failed to weave this particular thread into the rest of the overall narrative tapestry. In that way, WW 1984 felt choppy and discoherent.",none,,2021-03-09 19:53:46.815046,0

The story turns into a big, silly mess by the end and it really just loses me.  I just keep realizing I'm watching a bad movie at some point late in the film.  The first portion of the movie was good.  The childhood flashback was great.  The mall scene had cute moments, albeit the action seemed a bit out-of-flow/odd.  Too much bad CGI, but I liked the character interaction and the acting, so I dismissed the odd/over-done special effects.  

The story writing is just.....bad....no, TERRIBLE.....because I guessed what Diana's wish was and what would end up happening with the artifact the moment Diana wished on it casually.  I literally guessed the entire movie in that moment and it was a childishly easy guess.   So, the writing is fitting only for a child, which is okay because it's a comic-book movie.  

What I didn't think worked was the final 45 mins where the story just became a convoluted muck of overlapping quandaries and sidetracking nonsense.  I got a massive headache from the amount of 'dumb' the story deteriorated into.  The flow was bad in the most important portions of the movie.  I found that I enjoyed the romantic parts of the movie more than the  action, and I'm a man.....so, it translates that Chris Pine pretty much saved the movie with his parts and his great chemistry with the lead actress.  

Anyways, that's my review.  A ""D+"" grade.  It was below average, but watchable because at least one of the sub-plots, the romance, worked and wasn't cheesy.",none,,2021-03-09 19:53:47.029549,0

If it was that serious then Barbara should've reported it, called police, have diana walk her home, or just walk away.

Have the threat be that he could possibly reach to many bad people. But instead the movie actually made everybody make wishes and it just got too much. The concept of the wish making and its consequences would have been much better toned done and not overblown like they did it. Also, I liked Cheetah in the beginning as some sweet girl who thinks she's no one. And I like that she needed to feel like someone which is why she kept her wish.

Did she just white-day raped a man because he was unconscious? This is so fucking awkward. 

I'm shocked you like it. It's easily the worst movie of the year and one of the worst comic book movie next to Justice Leage. Gadot acing is bad, the script is laughably silly (and not in a good way)  - who wrote this, there were times when characters reactions were so ""unreal"" I thought it was written by a 10y on coke. It felt just so badly written. Gad acting with zero chemistry with Chris made the scenes that supposed to be sad - funny. I mean her last scene crying was like something out of bad improv. Generally, her delivery felt ""reactive"" like she wasn't sure if the mic is working. 

There are moments there that are good (like the famous Invisible Jet), but it just feels like something written in 90's - could be a Joel Schumacher film with its cheap ideas, shallow characters and lack on any emotion.

1. The opening scene - Diana is being told that taking shortcuts won‚Äôt help her. It had nothing to do with the movie itself, did it?
2. The second opening scene - her saving people and fighting with the bad guys felt SO SLAP-STICKY. Its like she was being a parody of herself (all the winks and smiles and one liners... why?!)
3. Steve - at one point I thought that it can‚Äôt be him and that he might be lying to Diana and trying to deceive her but nope. It was just him. Resurrected from the dead. Makes sense :/ 
4. Steve‚Äôs new body- you want me to believe that Diana would just allow him to occupy an innocent‚Äôs man body while they live happily ever after? 
5. The villain - the actor did a really wonderful job with what he had but he had so little. I mean, I didn‚Äôt even fully understand his agenda and why he wants more (yes, we see his background and what led him to being the way he is but it was kinda flat and not explored enough)
6. Cheetah - she‚Äôs a really interesting character on her own, and I wish they could make her the main villain or took her out of this one completely because she didn‚Äôt really serve any purpose within this plot line except introducing herself.
7. The final scene - SO MANY clich√© lines I felt like I was swimming in cheese. Also, the stakes were SO HIGH that it became kind of comedic and way to convoluted.
8. She can fly now?! Out of nowhere? Ugh. 
9. The message - the first movie wished for the audience to see that men and women can work together and be equals while brining different set of skills and beliefs to the table. The second movie gave up on this wish.
10. CGI. I‚Äôm gonna leave it at that.

What I liked: the cinematography and cool fighting scenes (that moment when she jumps way above the truck was WOW).",none,,2021-03-09 19:53:47.477617,0

1. Is she bullet proof or not? I always thought she wasn't a bullet proof since she is always trying to block bullets but in this film she does get hit in the chest but bullet never went through her. Yes, she bled but never went through. One can argue that it was because she was losing her power but then again, when she is fully powered why does she still blocks all the bullets?

2. I thought she was losing her power but then she never really lost all her power. But I thought she was supposed to lose all her power thought since Cheetah took her power. Also later she gets all her powers back but how?

3. I loved the scene with Lynda Carter and she is the Asteria, but is she just Amazon warrior or does she share the same power as Wonder Woman? Because I thought Amazon Warriors are not strong as Wonder Woman but they were little more stronger and faster than normal human beings? And if she is like Wonder Woman, how come Asteria aged since Wonder Woman don't age?",none,,2021-03-09 19:53:47.478084,0

Usually, I agree with you.

But sometimes, it really feels like you're trying to play a side. 
Like how you gave Endgame a positive review, despite it being th√© worst time travel movie I've ever seen. 
And you weren't all that positive about BvS's theatrical cut, but when the internet changed it's vote for the extended edition, you did too.. while it added nothing. Sure if filled in some holes (which you could figure out on your own during the theatrical release) but it didn't change the movie. 

And now, since covid-19, here's our first DC movie released and immediately the internet is attacking it in all the usual places. 

And look, I watched your review before the movie. 
Before the internet lost it's shit again because ""how dare they release a DC movie!?"" 

And I gotta say.. 
You seem to be piggy backing on the DC hate, and I don't like that. Cause I thought you were one of the real, unbiased, youtube reviewers. 

I mean, again with the cgi thing? 
And why? Because Marvel puts in 40% of their budget in CGI? 50% in their actors and the rest is to buy cheap ass horrible writers and tv directors/producers who are just there to fill a spot because everyone knows Feige makes the shots. 

I don't understand how a company, that treats it's employees (globally) so terrible. 
A company that mainstreamed not one, not two, but since the buying of Fox, has mainstreamed every franchise they have without repurcussions. 

Yet when DC, or anyone else, just DARES to change a color tone, or a hair style, or a button in the wrong place: ya'll MCU fans lose your friggin minds. 

I mean, come on. 
It's been 13 years. 
When are you people gonna grow up and move on? 

You're hurting the industry with all this constant bs. 

I mean, fuck. 
It's corona times. 
And look at you MCU losers losing your damn minds again about a DC movie being released. 
Wtf do you think will happen? That it'll earn a billion when 80% of movie theatres, globally, are closed due to corona!? 
Do you think it releasing on HBO MAX will make it more profitable than your precious Endgame (which is an actual of a real low effort shit movie)?? 

Move on.
Grow up. 
Leave DC alone already. 

If Marvel IS the best, as all you MCU fans have been pathologically whining about for the past 13 years
Then it doesn't need your help.
And if you're all so hell bend on putting DC in discredit, it shows how little faith you actually have in the MCU. 

Seriously, I thought corona times would change people. 
But ya'll got so much worse. 

It's been out for days, friggin days! 
You used to wait a month, now first day of release.

People even making Captain Marvel trend on twitter, to try and overshadow WW84. 
While no one likes Brie Larson. 
No one liked friggin Captain Marvel, it was such a shit movie I still haven't been able to finish it after all these years. 
But now it's suddenly trending and getting showered with love cause WW84 released? 

You MCU people really have 0 self-respect. 

But I'm surprised about you, Jeremy. Never would've thought. 
I had my suspicions before, but this this time it was on the nose. 

I mean, your only real exitement during the review was Pedro Pascal's role. 
Probably because you're such a huge Mandalorian fan. 

WW84 was a damn good movie. 

And why do a final battle in the dark? 

Cause that makes it epic. 

Just because Marvel and Lucasfilm prefer to do it while the sun is shining, does not make it standard. In fact, they're literally the only ones doing it. 

Final battles are 95% of the time held at night. That's nothing new. 

You're not reviewing movies anymore when you start to compare them to your favorites, even if it's subconsciously.

OK, 40 min in and I already found few plot holes, tons of things make no sense including the villain. Why does he do what he do, what he was trying to achieve? Makes no sense. The ""fish out of water"" thing kinda wears off real quick and adds almost nothing to the story. The guy from WW1 does not know what fireworks are? seriously? Same with prologue part, has no reason to be there whatsoever.
There is a ""teleportation"" part in the middle, feels very out of place. And whole scene prior to that could have been easily removed, it adds nothing to story. There is also an anti-hero here that learns and can do stuff just in few hours, makes no sense.
The whole ""wishing"" thing does not make any sense as well, what if people wish opposite things? Or identical wishes? Bruce Almighty, anyone? (this is not spoiler, it is in trailers)

The Ending is not only stretched, (movie is definitely feels 20-ish min too long) but just overall weird and kind of anticlimactic, no cool scenes at all. And everything comes back to normal like nothing happened. The whole movie feels like it does not need to exist.

If this wish stone made other people's wishes come true, and created giant walls and made other things materialize, then why didn't they just bring Steve back in his own body? Why did he have to take over this random man's life, who basically has no say in the matter? I'll bet you if the roles were reversed, and Batman or Superman wished for a dead lover to come back, and it possessed some random woman's body, and they had a scene with them waking up together in bed, that there would have been an uproar, because isn't that considered rape? Having sex with someone who's drunk or drugged, and not in control of their body or able to give consent, isn't that considered rape? And in the remainder of the movie this man, who is possessed by the spirit of Steve Trevor, is put into various perilous situations and even shot at and I don't think that's cool. Plus, I thought you only get one wish, so why did Barbara get two wishes? Her first wish to become like Diana, then the second wish to become an apex predator/Cheetah? That completely contradicts what we were told in the beginning of the movie. And why are all the men portrayed as catcalling jerks (i.e., except for Steve Trevor)? I think there are too many plot holes and things that make no sense, and that are just wrong and cringeworthy, especially the fact that a superhero has sex with a non-consenting possessed man.

1) Rather then having STEVE TREVOR return as a ghost with no physical body, he possesses the body of a random dude. Why bring him back? (im going to gloss over the fact consent wasn't given to Wonder Woman to ""boom boom"" by the guy possessed.) Why was Steve Trevor the one to convince WW she had to let him go? WW doesn't make the sacrificial choice.. (personal sacrifice for the greater good.) He makes that decision, not her. We did the fish out of water story already, why retread?

2)BARBRA /CHEETAH, horrible motivation, bad CGI, bad make-up effects. Disappointing ""final fight"".

3)MAXWELL LORENZANO ""Aka the WISHMASTER"". Knows about the wishing rock,....(somehow)... terrible powers, that were not consistent. Granting (A) wish, then denying a second wish, (cause he can't grant TWO wishes to the same person???), then granting a second wish to someone (cause the script needs him too), needs physical contact with the wisher, then not needing physical contact with the wisher... SOME people on the internet are comparing Maxwell to Trump, which is NOT true, ...Max ACTUALLY built a Wall...=)  

4)and Finally WONDER WOMAN, fighting crime dressed as WW, rather then, oh I don't know, ANYTHING ELSE and putting on a MASK! Cause obviously she doesn't want people to know about her, (destroying cameras, winking at people ""shhhh! It'll be our secret"") Because you know, you have to make sense about how BRUCE WAYNE found out about her from a WW2 Photo, rather then you know, during a WORLD CHANGING EVENT?? Bruce Wayne: ""Hey remember that time when peoples wishes were coming true, and there were reports of a woman kicking the Sh*t out of people during the same time.... i will NOT make any kind of connection.""

5)Director, Writer... WTF were you thinking.... Why set this in 1984? Other then you seeing Captain Marvel and saying to yourself, we should do that!!! 

Why do the female thieves And/Or ""Bad Girls"" go free/not captured and punished? (girl thieves get away from the store, shopkeeper running the Black Market gets away, Cheetah gets away.) 

If Cheetah wished to be like WW, gaining her powers and more then likely her weaknesses as well, why does Cheetah pass out from being electrocuted and not WW? Even though Wonder Woman is wearing metal?(if ""magic or special armor fine, but DOESNT explain why she withstood being electrocuted.) 

Barb/Cheetah threatens to destroy WW if she continues to go after Max, yet, lucky for WW, rather then, oh i don't know, Cheetah WISHING WW was DEAD with her second wish. she decided to become a Kittie cat person.

The CGi was HORRIBLE. where did all the money go to this film?

Terrible ""teleporting"" story telling.

Unearned power(S) that manifest from no where, YET, don't appear in other films in the future. (BVS, JL)  (I think turning things invisible would come in handy.)

Near the end of the film, Both Russia and the United States launch Nukes at each other, ....now, renouncing your wish, would mean the Nuke's CLOSER to Russian border wouldn't exist anymore, BUT that doesn't negate the other Nukes that EXISTED BEFORE  that were launched in retaliation... the world should have been Nuked...

The Golden Armor served as nothing but a Kittie Cat scratch post, WW didn't need it to fly, she did that already, it was used to ""look cool"" and nothing more. Otherwise why wouldn't she have brought her shield and sword. 

WW final plea to Earth, didn't come in Song Form....""Imagine""

I could list much MUCH more, but i think I've made my point...

What they did with Steve trevor was so fucking stupid, 
Have the soul? os steve inhabit the body of some stranger? because that is what she wished for?
made no fucking sense, 

Gal was better playing Wonder Woman in the first one, hell, every thing was better in the first Wonder Woman.
The only thing she did here (apart from the walking away from steve because she's a strong woman and doesn't need a man) was scowl, the entire movie she's scowling, every moment of screen time she has she's scowling, to a point that i think that Gal thinks she's angry at everything, all the time. Before steve's here and after steve is left. she's scowling.. 

The man bashing also was a thing in this movie, because as you may have noticed, every dude in this film except for the fake steve, is a complete asshole.

so many plot holes so many studpid beats in the movie, the bad guy all of a sudden changing in to a cat without any reason, the missles that were fired dissapeared after every one took back their wish, steve knowing how to fly a fucking JET, because he's a pilot and thusly knows how to fly anything, yet he's baffled about fireworks and don'g know what a fucking subway is (they had trains you know, and yes, fireworks have been invented than) this movie..

What grabs me here is that its an entirely original superhero movie (anyone name a cape flick that matched it- cape flick now,  drawing similarities to non super hero movies opens the door to invalidate Logan cos its Western based, so unless you saying both WW84 and Logan are crap for copying non-capes movies and defying the conventions of Superhero movies, then no)...

Anyway, when someone creates something original like this, it‚Äôs bound to get folks who can‚Äôt cope and feel its awful. And that‚Äôs OK. If it doesn‚Äôt work for some folks, then it doesn‚Äôt work for them. Their opinion is valid; it didn‚Äôt make them feel good in their pee-per place or something. Can‚Äôt invalidate that. 
But doesn‚Äôt impact whatsoever upon WW84 being a totally original superhero movie. 

Me? It made me feel awesome. Loved the acting/script/cinematography/Mis en scene/sound editing on point/good score- soundtrack/lovely continuity moments...

She's got the acting ability and the presence to define Wonder Woman the same way Christopher Reeve defined Superman. But if you have that kind of actor for the role, why keep giving her crap to work with? The first action scenes for the heroine are literally ""Wonder Woman: Mall Cop"". She's one of the strongest super heroes in DC and she's got nothing better to do than to police a mall robbery, a scene that went on far too long. That actually describes much of the movie: 150 minutes of scene after scene that should have been edited out. The Chris Pine 80's clothing scene? It's 80-ish seconds of screen time that's painful to watch and does nothing to advance the plot. And why is Chris Pine even in the movie? Because apparently Diana Prince is so emotionally stunted that she can't get over a relationship that lasted only a few weeks, even after several decades.

But I don't think it's a waste of time. I agree with you on the runtime. What I truly think we have here is a case of the trailer having dropped too long ago. People had a lot of time to decide what the film was going to be and build up expectations. And having now seen the film, the trailer in a way - showed too much. Not that it was a ""bad"" trailer. But practically every action sequence in the film was featured in some way or another in the marketing campaign of the film. Meaning that the only material not really featured in any of the trailers were the so-called ""character scenes"". Which by and large is where I felt this film fell a bit flat. Diana's isolation post-Steve's death has honestly been done a bit to death at this point. Literally every single time she shows up in one of these movies it's a montage of: ""Gal Gadot in a fabulous outfit looking sad because dead boyfriend.""

I think it was a huge mistake to show Chris Pine in the trailers. Because that would actually have been a nice twist. I also felt myself wishing for just a little more groundwork on both the Barbara and the Maxwell Lord characters. Establish them as SUCH losers first, that their literal willingness to watch the world burn JUST so they can have whatever they want.....would be more established. I don't think they did a completely piss poor job of this. I just would have appreciated one or two more scenes. Instead of JUST showing the attempted rape and rescue; show Barbara eating alone in the lunchroom day after day, and in then eating dinner alone night after night in an empty apartment that's littered with Cat paraphernalia. We got one scene of her greeting a few people and having them not talk back to her, and then Diana shows up and they become friends. I didn't FEEL her utter desperation to be noticed the way I would've if the plot and pacing of the film would've allowed for us to just spend a bit more time with her. As for Maxwell Lord, I don't think they established him as enough of a loser. Yes we get the whole ponzy scheme scene. But instead of a disgruntled investor, I would've appreciated his son's mother, or maybe a parent being super disappointed in what he's become. Maybe even a phone message from a wife in the process of leaving him, or a divorce attorney advising him on the latest one. I'm possibly nitpicking, but given how much time the film devotes to their downfall post wish; I think it would have been nice to sympathize with the state of their lives before.",none,,2021-03-09 19:53:48.997938,0

The only ""action"" in the first 3/4 of the movie was the horrible mall scene. When the action did commence, it was some of the worst CGI I've seen in since 1984. 

The main villain was an interesting take on villains but really didn't flesh out. I felt like there should have been more evil to him. More like Lex Luthor. And instead of the flashback scene, they could've been taken the time to build his storyline.

The Kristin Wiig character was an ok sort of side villain that should have been used to set up for an appearance in one of the next DC Justice League movies. But they chose to bring her along fully only to relegate her to a horrible costumed Cheetara fighting in a horrible CGI scene that was needed only because there was so little action throughout the rest of the movie.

I guess bringing Trevor back to give WW someone to work with and play off of was benign enough. And he did a good job with his role.

Kristen Wig's character is totally shoe-horned and would've worked better as the single villain for the third movie set in the modern day. Wonder Woman's movements make no sense whatsoever but to be fair that was a problem in the first movie too. For some unknown reason, they decided to write Maxwell and Steve as the most interesting characters with the best lines leaving Diana and Barbara feeling like afterthoughts. The wish system made little sense at best, especially explaining away an impending nuclear holocaust by the magic of revoking a wish for more nukes (keyword MORE, implying the existence of prior nukes that would not have disintegrated mid-flight when wishes got renounced). The CGI was god awful and the movie was 45 mins to an hour too long (definitely should've gotten rid of that flashback sequence and, in my opinion, opened with a Donner-style ""save the cat"" moment to endear us to Wonder Woman).

Patty asked Johns ok I wanna tell it in the Cold War or do it in a way that seems compelling, what can we do? 

Johns: Bring in maxwell lord and do something with dreams and make it so obvious and obscure and use this stone thing as well. 

I DONT blame the screen writer for this one. He wrote Godzilla and is writing Marvel‚Äôs Shang-Chi. 

This was Johns fault or little bit of patty‚Äôs. 


 But overall the director should know what makes a good story direction and plot wise, action wise, and cinematically. 

And this pandemic killed their box office which is unfortunate, but that doesn‚Äôt explain why a movie has to be written badly. 

It‚Äôs like 2 different directors made this film. I doubt patty made the opening scene, if she did...I don‚Äôt know what was going through her head for he rest of the plot. 


I‚Äôm happy they chose the particular color grading cuz it takes place in the 70s and makes it modern, but the plot has to be compelling, should‚Äôve talked to the chia reeves Superman directors or someone. 

Should‚Äôve used the rock thing as a secondary plot point but make it more grounded. 

Also the action is kinda over the top causing it to be corny. I‚Äôm happy WW can fly but her flying style is corny as well. 

Some people don‚Äôt know how to direct. 

I‚Äôm glad patty will be directing Star Wars X-Wing. People can share our disappointment cuz I as a DC can‚Äôt wait for another DC film besides this film cuz it‚Äôs left a bad taste in my mouth.",none,,2021-03-09 19:53:49.458453,0

Bad plot - make it make sense please! Cheetah had very little screen time, 
Max Lord was not that interesting to me, Diana had the armor on for 2 seconds, the movie did not have that many funny moments - it was really boring actually, and where was the 80's music?? It barely had an 80's sound track. Lots of cheese all over the place. The fight scenes were pretty good, but overall it was just a mess. This movie was so hyped up just to be a let down in the end.

I don't think you can capture that same feel without an audience. Endgame would feel like a totally different movie if the first time I saw it was at home. DC is trying to go away from having a connected universe and just making fun films like Shazam. The entire Amazon Olympic scene was probably a silly way to set up the message of the movie but it was suppose to be fan service for the audience to cheer at. The problem is the original Wonder Woman movie was a serious movie so it gave the audience wrong intentions. DC hasn't found a way to fix tone to audience. I thought it was a good movie because I love 80s cheese fest and buddy action comedies. I would prefer more movies like the Dark Knight tbh but this is okay as well. DC's appeal is weird because their movies are polarizing. Like some people hate Man of Steel and some people think it's one of the greatest comic book movies ever.

It definitely had some flaws... Cheetah was ok, but felt forced.

So many plot holes, continuity errors, and overall messy storyline, bad stunts, bad cgi, and too much cheese (ugh)
The intro scene of young Diana was actually pretty good- but it needed a stronger callback later in the film. I had to think about it a little after the movie to truly see it‚Äôs significance. (also....wasn‚Äôt she still training in secret at that age??)
The mall scene was....awful oh my god. The cheetah plot was NOT done well despite the fact that it had such potential. I did NOT like the idea that Barbara magically gains powers and somehow is capable of going toe to toe with Diana. Once Diana got her powers back, there should never have BEEN a final fight, she should‚Äôve destroyed cheetah. I mean....the girl trained for literal centuries and Barbara.....went for a jog???
And the armor story was a WASTE and clearly just used so they could sell the image and merch (built to withstand the whole world.....cracks after two minutes fighting cheetah)
Plus are they not even going to bother to explain how such a catastrophic global event impacted the world and the timeline? Bruce specifically states in Justice League that no ones seen Diana since the First World War but her face was literally broadcast to the whole freaking world so..... plus all her other superheroing throughout the movie

I love the dark gritty nature of the Snyder movies, but they can seem very cold at times. This was a good break from that. I‚Äôm not going to compare this movie to the first because it‚Äôs honestly a completely different beast. 

The story, however, does feel very inconsequential. It does nothing to serve the larger plot building towards a showdown with steppenwolf or darkseid. It doesn‚Äôt connect to any of the other movies (except the first WW), and doesn‚Äôt even continue upon the story of the first WW. While I thought the movie itself was good, this is not a good way of building up the DCEU.

It‚Äôs greatest triumph is making the audience fall in love with Diana. After Man of Steel and Batman vs Superman, the main heroes of the Justice League were starting to feel really dark and morose. That might be Batman‚Äôs thing, but it‚Äôs not really supposed to be anyone else‚Äôs.

It was also too long. She was just toying with those robbers and it was just a pretty scene to show off her swinging through the mall.
Pedro Pascal was good as Lord, but as a villain, he was meh. That ending was anticlimactic. He wasn't even actually a villain, he was a greedy man who realized he already had everything he needed, it just took  destroying society to realize it lmao.
WW and Trevor scenes were nice.
I liked Minerva, but as she got more greedy, she was just another henchman. When everybody was taking their wishes back, I didn't think she was going to do it, but she did and that was bad. Did she somehow gain her niceness back to take the wish back lol. There's no reason she should have wanted to take the wish back. The cheetah transformation was trash.
The events of this movie taking place before every other DCEU movie, yet it never being mentioned in the others is just a big ass plothole. She also has flight? or was that just gliding with style lol. It had to be the latter because I don't remember her being able to fly in the others.
That gold suit would have been nice to have vs supes and/or Steppenwolf.

Alas, that did not happen.

Instead, I was subjected to a tortuous ADDITIONAL 90 minutes of preaching, not against one specific target, but all of them.  Believe it or not, this film glorifies the status quo.  

Yep, that's exactly right: if your people have been suffering for centuries at the hands of others, or even if you yourself would just like to actually enjoy that hard-earned vacation on a sunny beach your hectic schedule won't allow, then you are a fatally-flawed immoral so-and-so and we‚Äôll ‚Äúsee you next Tuesday,‚Äù you naughty greedy person.

Apparently, we humans should not even entertain the idea of having what we want in life.  I don‚Äôt mean actually trying to acquire or attain it; I mean even just THINK about it, because what if it came true?  Your one desire, along with everyone else‚Äôs desire, would destroy the entire planet in very short order.  BAD human!  BAD human!

And if that isn't enough, the film ends with the Red Star of Communism rising high in the sky, and then Wonder Woman following close behind it to triumphant music that would have made Wagner jealous.  I‚Äôm not even stretching here -- it literally does this!

The story hit me on the nose so many times I needed a Band-Aid.

Enough with the Hollywood preaching, guys.  You want the movie industry and the theater system to survive COVID-19?  Then stop it.  If it‚Äôs a superhero(ine) action film, stick to superhero(ine)s and super-villains; go ahead and ignore the most basic tenets of physics with your special effects if you wish, but tell a story that won‚Äôt make us all feel like we have been subjected to an involuntary anal probe by some ham-fisted Social Justice Warrior, okay?

Yeah the movie tries tooo much to be pc, and is full with forced diversity! disappointed like many others said. even if the grand meaning was ""be happy with what you got and don't wish more"" is very unrealistic and told through a very weak script. Wonder Woman tried to Be Thor Ragnarok and Ragnarok was a parody. Wonder Woman 1 was just so much better especially the plot. Both movies are cheesy... but this one is to global levels that are just unrealistic anymore. the writing was all over the place. Alladin deal with a similar storyline in a much more believable way!

Like yes, the mall scene in the beginning did feel cheesey, but other than that I think this movie handled everything pretty well.
It was like each character had their own arc and struggles, Diana had to learn to let go of Steve, Cheeta had her ""fall from grace"" and lost her humanity, and Maxwell had to give up his hunger for power to save his son. Also, you get to see how selfish and greedy mankind is. I thought it was all done perfectly. 
Now, as for Jeremy saying that it felt like cheeta was just shoved in at the end? I thought it was clear that the fight happened because she was keeping Diana from Max. But even if it did feel last minute, who would you say did it better, cheeta in this movie or the green goblin in TASM2??
Now if anything, I do wish that they had shown her transformation into cheeta, but I wouldn't hold that against the movie. 
I would give this movie a 10/10 +1 for the mid credit scene.",none,,2021-03-09 19:53:50.144079,0

I love a lot of the actors involved, but they weren't given much to work with. DC's visual style is off-putting in all the movies that aren't directed by Chris Nolan or titled The Joker. They have managed to ruin the best character of their relaunch and I'm glad I didn't have to pay for this viewing.  Wonder Woman flies or Lasso Helicoptered halfway across the country? Jaguar swings around on electric wires for five minutes before electricity, suddenly, has an effect on her? Let's have Wonder Woman have the same ""Change your ways"" conversation with the villains 3 or 4 times throughout the movie so it loses any of the weight it carried by the finale. DC comics are awesome, their TV shows are pretty darn good, but their movies are terrible. They are full of sloppy character development and rushed plot lines. We weren't given much reason to care about any of the characters, as presented, because Superman and Wonder Woman are the only ones that were given a background before the massive collaboration abomination that was Justice League. Marvel had you bought in with their multiple film launches before the big super hero team movie. DC goes straight for the Avengers box office without laying the tracks and made half-hearted attempts at solo films that failed to add anything to the characters featured in them. DC, please watch a Marvel movie to see how a super hero universe should be developed and adapted to film and how fan service should be applied (judiciously).

She doesn't need any man at all as she is a strong woman but Steve presence is her weakness. Corny action scenes and special effects.
Just a few mentions:
1. She can lasso a bullet and lightning, really?
2. She learned how to fly with the dumbest motion ever, yet unable to fly in Justice League.
3. Steve comes back to life, but why in a different man's body?
4. Steve is lost in modern 1984, can't figure out an escalator but can fly a modern jet.
5. Makes jet invisible so it can avoid radar, cartoon logic here I guess. The jet is still an object with mass, radar can still pick it up. 
     Also cartoon logic, jets invisible but you can see the occupants.
6. Men in this movie are creeps supposedly. Says hi or looks at a beautiful dressed  woman and gets shut down immediately or the evil eye.
7. Can't get to Max at the end because of the supernatural force preventing her yet her lasso magically attached to his leg.
8. Dons Asteria's armor that gets shredded by a cat.

It is a well made thoughtful and entertaining movie. Only today I had commented about super hero movies either choosing to put a concept or a character at the fore front. Wonder Woman brilliantly puts both together and gives a viewer a sequel that beats the original which itself is rare and achievement. With an interesting story that has familiar elements WW84 brick by brick and stone by stone (spoiler alert) takes the viewer to the final concept and the message at the heart of story. The major credit must go to the screen play and the script writer who show that you can tell an old story in a new way if you want to. They really ensure that viewer misses nothing and plot comes together at the end even though you spend a good 45 minutes building the story up. I mean what Wonder Woman manages to achieve in its narrative is outstanding given its main plot is grounded in fantasy and yet its idea is so contemporary and relevant to current world. The film also has great production designs, good acting very well used CGI and action sequences.  The film does have a few minor flaws and lacks the big confrontation between the super heroine and bad guy in the final sequence which we normally see in action movies. It takes some entertainment value  but allows the movie to deliver its message very emphatically. This is a well made movie and will rank among the top 10 super hero movies as time goes by. It will be remembered as it has emotional as well as intellectual depth.  A pat for Patty Jenkins and maybe expect a Oscar nomination as well. Gal Gadot is a vast improvement over her previous WW films and she truly acts the character maybe a supporting actor nomination for Max Lord. Well done.

bad parts;
the whole opening sequence :
- i hate how now they tried to sell child diana as unrealistically talented against the adult racers. it literally went against anything that the first movie showed us at her training montage
- and the atmosphere of the city. i critisized dcue before for having edgy and depressive atmosphere. but i never thought i would hate it for reminding me lazy town

diana's crime fighing routine :
- instead of blocking the car diana flips the car and risks people
- bunch of girls steals from a shop, risked their lives while running and pushed a bride to her possible death if it wasnt for WW. but some how we never saw them pay for their actions.
- everything was cringe about the mall scene. the way how the criminals react, the way her fight against them, the way how the movie shove a cute moment with kids, the way how she unnecessarily violent on delivering those unarmed criminals to the cops everything handled so cartoonishly
- the not so suprising pattern about the victims she saved

phasing : things escalated most bullshit ways possible. robbers, the wish stone, the guy who happens to know the wish stone, asteria back story, global broadcast satellite etc. almost all major plot devices were sooooo out of nowhere. it was also very unsettling how someone like diana wasnt more suspicious about the reasons behind her ex bf's resurrections out of another man's body

good parts;
action scenes: even tho it contains ridiculous moments like when diana save kids by catching the rocket launcher scene. its overall pretty fan to watch and after 3 movie of mary sue-ing, it was so refreshing to see WW's showing struggle and actually put the lasso at work more often. and the coreography wasnt that bad

villains :
i dont think this needs a explanation. im so glad this movie didnt shit on maxwell lord like cw's supergirl or cheetah like recent cartoons did

final showdown :
this movie turned something that i hate, into a beautiful cinematography. narration. i hate how hero starts talking about the moral of the story in the worst time possible. 
but here they consistently turnedthis into the very thing that saves the day. WW touch the world with the truth and gave us a real character developent(a development that chronologically destined to be slain)",none,,2021-03-09 19:53:50.597247,0

Did I love it...not so much! Let me say that the movie was entertaining but could have been better. Ive had to come to terms with the fact that the egos in Hollywood no longer permit an exact or close remake of a successful movie or character. Nor do they keep in tact the back stories or origins of said characters that have been told and retold for decades! I love the actors that are in this movie and that is 90% of why I liked it! However I would have preferred a Cheetah sub-story not connected to the Gold v WW plot. The introduction or use of the Gold winged suit after WW was restored to full strength wasn't necessary but had to be tied into the intro which gives the flashback its only purpose to the film, to talk about the prized gold wing suite or armor! I would love for DC to just take a story straight from the comics and leave all the facts in tact and let that be the story!

Recycled tropes and themes from the modern femi-nazi handbook.  Every woman in the film was portrayed as fierce, intelligent and strong,  whilst every male character was affable at best or completely loathsome and lecherous at worst.  It was literally like watching every modern feminist girl power fluff flick of the past few years.  They could have inserted scenes from the abysmal birds of prey into this movie and nobody would even notice.  And why isn't anyone mentioning how wonder woman used an innocent man against his will?  Steve Trevor may have been using the guy's body, but it was still an innocent man who wonder woman had sex with against his will and without consent! That's called sexual assault.  And to further punctuate the point, look at how she was gazing lustfully at the guy again at the end of the movie.  She basically raped the guy and then sized him up to see if he remembered.  Imagine if the roles were reversed, a man in her situation would have been cancelled faster than you could say Harvey Weinstein.  Disgusting Hollywood hypocrites",none,,2021-03-09 19:53:50.821923,0

It wasn't as much as it was hyped up to be, but I wouldn't consider it a complete failure.  I love Wonder Woman's character.  The movie had several technical issues; including the CGI, the pacing, and the direction of some points of the story.   I didn't know which character to focus on.  Also, I don't understand how anyone anticipated that the main villain would be anti Trump.  There's literally nothing about him that reminds me of Trump at all.  He's just like Jim Carey's character from Liar Liar with Trump's outer appearance, but that's it.  He's even redeemed by the end of the film.  My biggest issue with this film and some of the other DC movies is that, unlike the Marvel films, there's nothing added to the overall universe.  There isn't anything foreshadowed that we can look forward to in later films.  We didn't even see what happened to the crystal.  I also wished that we saw what the god of that stone looked like; that was one of my few disappointments.  When Maxwell started to break down from the wishes, I thought he was going to turn into that god.  If he turned into that god, and they fought then she talked Maxwell Lord out of the possession, I feel like I would've appreciated the ending more.",none,,2021-03-09 19:53:50.821985,0

My only concern is the slow pacing at the start. They could've done without that opening.

The plot was nearly the same as the first one. Drenched in oversaturated cgi, and more upsetting it looked like what a 12 year old thinks the year 1984 actually looked like. Everything from the Clich√©d fashion, the cars, building designs, didn't exist in the 1984 I remember. And that stupid fucking scene where they steal a stored jet fighter from what is basically a museum was somehow fully fuelled and ready to go. Oddly, the museum for retired aircraft had a manned aircraft control tower and full security to chase a fighter jet down a runway at an airport that doesn't have any flights because ITS A MUSEUM. Not to mention, they flew overseas, and across continental Africa to Egypt without having to hit up a few air-to-air refueling tankers along the way. In reality that jet would have ditched 500 kms off the eastern seaboard when it ran out of fuel. Maybe it ran efficiently on biofuel made from bullshit. Not to mention, HOW THE FUCK does a pilot from WW1 who was flying biplanes (a fairly new invention at that time) just hop into a modern aircraft and suddenly just know how to fire it up? Its like asking me to hop out of my hobby fishing canoe with a small electric trolling motor, and go fire up and run a nuclear aircraft carrier!

When an edgier Superman was introduced in MoS, people rejected it and demanded they wanted the Donner archetype Superman since that's what most people have come to see Superman as; Happy, smiley guy who doesn't kill at least on the big screen.. I think the same situation has happened with WW1984. We were introduced to the edgy Amazon in BVS and WW but now we get a 180 version which by the way is still an accurate version of the character but not a version that most people expected or anticipated as even being a possibility for better and for worse.

I think WW1984 deserves a watch and hopefully viewers can understand that this is a true version of the character, albeit a different version but still a true version.
WW still tops my list but 84 does have good stuff in it.",none,,2021-03-09 19:53:51.716431,0

Idk why MCU fans are being such a'holes again. It's corona times. Box office are shit these days, the movie is released digitally. 

Wth are MCU fans so afraid off? 

I mean, they even went out of their way to have Captain Marvel trend on Twitter to counter WW84. They're trending a shitty movie with an actress hated in her own fandom just to undermine WW84. 

It's pathetic. Even more so knowing it's gonna be the 14th year they do this, very soon. 
When will they move on from this? 
I mean, th√© worst comic book movie I have ever seen has made over 3 billion dollars. J√∫st because it's Marvel. J√∫st because of that one portal scene... I mean... It made a billion more during it's 2nd release where it had 5 additional mimutes... 5 minutes extra and you all went and spend so much money just to be able to say ""told you so, Marvel is better"". I mean, it's nuts. Endgame was a shitty time travel movie. An even shittier comic book movie. Barely an action movie. But just because it's Marvel and the last of a saga, it was elevated to legend-type of succes. 

Meanwhile actual good movies get trashed because they're not (like) Marvel movies...... 
13 years, going on 14. When does it end? Seriously? 

I just want to enjoy the movies I want to see. Why must marvel fans always ruin everything for everyone? -_-

The only good thing that comes out of the movie is the casting of Maxwell Lord and Cheetah. But everything else is just a disappointment. And most of the world will agree with me here that this is not a WW movie i was expecting from Patty. I am a DC fan and i just love the first one, but i dont like first one because of its awesome action sequence alone or good story line, i like it because it just kept me hooked.

Wonder Woman tried to Be Thor Ragnarok and Ragnarok was a parody. Wonder Woman 1 was just so much better especially the plot. Both movies are cheesy... this one is to global lavels that are just unrealistic anymore. the writing was all over the place. Alladin deal with a similar storyline in a much more believable way!

1.) I think you went to get popcorn or a drink druing most action scenes, because this movie certainly doesn't actually lack them.
2.) The feels, while they're there, for me somehow didn't work very well, because as soon as they started transforming country borders, it became clear that resolving this would require to somehow reversing the wishes. And as soon as that became clear, most tearjerk-moments didn't really weigh anything anymore. At least to me. That took me out of the story.
3.) I still enjoyed the movie very much ‚Äì and the main thing for me was one emotional thing that kept on working even though the main plot reversed basically everything: The fact that a pilot taught Diana the trick of flying. That was nice.
4.) The Lynda Carter scene (yes, end credits) felt tacked on just to have her in the movie as long as she's still alive. So did the end scene that was probably a reshoot to have it Christmas themed. Bit tacky.",none,,2021-03-09 19:53:52.204678,0

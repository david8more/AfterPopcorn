I'm so glad I went opening night too, because marketing companies took the soonest chance they could get away with to show things I definitely wouldn't have wanted to know was going to happen when walking into the theater. The weight of my expectations were not only the entirety of my history with loving superheroes and growing up with the MCU since I was like 10 years old, but also all of the extra hype I felt from all the theory videos I saw building up to this. My hopes could have extremely easily crashed and burned, but instead this movie literally felt like it was hand-crafted specifically for me. And I know I'm not alone in that, either. It's everything I've wanted to see on the movie screen since I started loving movies when I was like 3 or 4 years old. It's the first movie I've ever seen to make me feel (for a few weeks at least) like I didn't need to watch movies anymore. I haven't stopped watching this on at least a bi-weekly basis since I first got my copy in August and I don't plan to stop. It now holds an extremely proud spot as my favourite movie of all time and I don't see how any other film could take that spot anymore. But that being said, I also thought that when I walked out of that first Avengers movie, so I'm keeping my hopes wide open. Thank you, Chris.

The jokes almost never landed and made me cringe. Also, my main problem is that this movie couldn’t decide whether it was action or a soap opera so it built up all this drama and released in a fairly short time travel sequence all things considered. That part was rushed and sped past like a blur, the movie got where it wanted to go and dashed by it before we really got to enjoy it. The end fight suffered from marvels greatest flaw, we don’t care about thousands of faceless enemies dying, we just see endless hordes that we know don’t matter and showing them being cut down is pointless. Also, they killed Thanos which I loved then retconned him back for the end just like that because they decided “no wait actually we still need this character” I don’t usually what to pick apart Avengers films but this film rushed its good parts and built its film around purely the visuals of the final fight scene.

I like marvel and the concepts it’s created over the course of its life and the people who tackled all of that to make these movies have my respect and admiration.

Honestly, I went into this movie thinking they could NEVER top what they accomplished with Infinity War.   I thought Infinity War was a true cinematic masterwork, with a ""bad guy"" we have not seen on screen in such a way since Darth Vader in the original Star Wars trilogy.  Thanos was the best CG character since Gollum in LOTR, perfectly done in a believable way and given such depth that you forget you're watching a digital creation.  How could they ever top that?  Well, to my surprise and delight, they have.  End Game is absolutely the perfect ending to this 10+ year story, and the ultimate payoff for fans.  Honestly, I think in 10 years time they will be studying this in film schools all over the world as the screenwriting and character development in the Marvel Universe movies are impossibly good.  I say impossibly because it should have never worked as well as it did.  These are ""super hero"" characters that they actually managed to get audiences who never read a comic book invested in.

But I look past that instantly because everything until those few moments are horrifically terrifying.

Mostly, because the ending of Avengers: Infinity War was such a refreshing change compared to how superhero movies usually end. Instead of relying on time travel to bring about a timeline, where ""good again triumphs over evil"", I would be much more interested in seeing how the MCU continues to develop long after those horrendous events (with half its heroes dead or missing).


Because, in all reality: Thanos seems to be the only one who ""gets it"". Population growth is exponential, while our universes resources are finite … in this regard, Thanos' actions remind me of what Bill Burr had to say on ""population control"" (in his standup special  ""I'm Sorry You Feel That Way“):

„That's my plan: we should just make babys illegal for, like, the next like twenty–five, thirty years. Right?  Wouldn't that be great? Think about it, somebody is born – three people born every second for one person dying – so if you not make anybody, it's like – bam! – somebody just died. Right? Somebody just fell down some stairs …  somebody just tripped over a skateboard, right?  And you know what? Fucking lanes just openin' up on the highway. Right? You know, you get to work a little sooner, you're in a better mood.  Dude, you get it down to like thirty thousand people. Thirty thousand people would be the shit … Right? Superbowl comes along, everybody can go. Right? […] You wouldn't have to recycle. Dude, if there was thirty thousand people, man, everybody here could literally drive your own tank. You drive a tank, you could throw toxic waste off the top – you could shoot a bald eagle right in the head … nah, there's plenty of them, plenty of them. Dude they're shittin' all over my tank, what the fuck am I supposed to do?“

Of course, the events in Infinity War – in a kind of unfortunate ""collateral damage"" – cost Spider-Man, Doctor Strange, Star-Lord, Gamora, Groot and others their lives. But, all in all, Thanos is the real hero here :-)",none,,2021-03-08 16:28:22.596100,0

Like just hold on this a bit more. I gave infinity war a B+, it was ok. The cgi and action scenes were the least interesting to me. 

Now that that’s out of the way I feel endgame was a far superior film. The pacing, acting, character build up and development were all top shelf. It didn’t feel 3 hours. I like the direction they went with all the characters. I hate superhero films. I feel they’re boring and unnecessary but this felt like a film of old, the characters are what sell it and the actors do a tremendous job. Again the action scenes were my least favourite but even they were the best I’ve seen in a superhero film. Everything was just balanced perfectly. I go into movies with critique mode on and break a film down to its core as I’m watching it. Not with endgame. With endgame all that bullshit went out the window and I was there with the characters from beginning to end. I had almost a spiritual awakening with this movie on a total film level. I had never laughed, been so tense or cheered and teared up so much in a movie ever! And I hate and advocate against superhero movies. This is a result of a perfect, tightly crafted script, beautiful performances and a vision beyond visionary that will undoubtably stand the test of time. A+.

The first two and some odd hours were ALL filler and provided some character building and a ton of fan-service/easter eggs from past movies. It was paced terribly and I got bored up until the final fight scene which was full of the awesome goodness that I wanted from this movie. 

The writing and the plot involving time-travel (anything involving time-travel) just messes up things and results in more questions and plot-holes than answers.

There are so many things wrong with this movie, that is hard to describe everything. If you make an analysis based only in the story and the direction, it`s already really bad. The movie, tells something and does another, the time travel is heavily bad; Hulk says that is impossible to change the present, however, they simply destroy everything, Thor gets his hammer from the past; Nebula kills herself; Black Widow sacrifice herself to get the Soul Stone, but Gamora still dead in the present.

Superherowise, this movie is also horrible, through the movie, you don`t feel you are seeing heroes talking to each other, but actors interacting with one another dressing like superheroes. The movie is a comedy movie with superheroes, action exists only in the final part of the movie.

Politicalwise, this movie is even worse, the feminism been pushed down our throats, Captain America passing over his shield to Falcon instead of Bucky, his best friend and with similar characteristics of his. Captain Marvel, the worst character in movies so far, arrogant and insanely overpowered; The future Avengers are all girls, Hawkeye Daughter; Ironman Daughter; Antman daughter; and even Peper Potts appears of nowhere if a nanotech armor, Really? But the thing that is worse than all, is Cap, the character who represents the great and old America, turning into a selfish and egoist guy, traveling back in time to be with Megan Carter, forgetting about Sharon, and acknowledging that Tony was right, the guy who made all the bad decision, trading freedom to false security, like the government tries to do.

In a Nutshell, this is a movie trying to brainwash you to think the what is bad is good and what is good is bad, with horrible writing, but great visual effects.",none,,2021-03-08 16:28:22.597705,0

There were definitely enough things that I DID like, so I'd give it a neutral evaluation.  Trying to keep this a spoiler-free comment in a spoiler-free review, things that just bothered me too much--

-this isn't entirely the fault of this movie but rather that of the previous, but it was similar to The Last Jedi where they take the story to such an unprecedented place that there seems no way to deal with or adapt to the situation, but rather it seems necessary to be undone.

-a BIG problem for me - different characters in this series have different abilities or sets of abilites which are not equal in terms of power and impact that the character can have, and that's fine - Thor and Dr. Strange can do things that have significantly more impact than things that can be done by Hawkeye or Rocket.  But so far, even the more powerful characters (Dr. Strange, Hulk) need to play their role as part of a team and need the help of some of the less powerful characters (Black Widow, Starlord) for the team to succeed in their goals.  To this point, the Avengers franchise has been a really good spokesperson (eh... spokesmovie?) for the concept of teamwork.  But in this movie, there is a character on our team who is so powerful that they don't need the help of other characters - instead, they make the rest of the characters more or less irrelevant.  The producers seem to be aware of this and deal with the problem by finding a reason to remove that character for the majority of the 2nd act, and only reintroduce them at the very end, because the best way for the team to address ALL of their problems would be to sit back and drink beers while this person took care of all their problems single-handedly, and there would be no tension in any part of the movie.

- some things are such a significant part of a character, that they almost define a character - while it may be cool to see another character have that thing, it can bother some people when they do it.

-in the previous movie, a character performs a certain act with a certain McGuffin and things happen immediately with remarkable impact.  In this movie, a different character performs the same action with the same McGuffin, and things take much longer and seemingly with less impact, enough so that a third character needs to do it for the resolution.  Seems inconsistent.

-I respectfully disagree with your assessment that this needed to be a 3 hour movie - most Marvel movies are around the two and a half hour mark, and this could simply be done be removing 15 minutes from the first and last act.  In regards to the first act, we already know how the previous film ended and could anticipate how this would affect our characters.  We didn't need to see FOUR different characters act disconnected, defeated and jaded because of the events and create such a depressing tone - instead, just leave in the one that um... ""alters the appearance"" of a character, because that was awesome.  Edit out the other three.  As for the final act, it reminds me of LotR-Return of the King where the final resolution takes place, and then the movie goes on and on for what seems like eternity.  Definitely could have saved 15 minutes there too.

-When you make a sequel, there's usually an attempt to revisit but ""up the ante"" with some events of the first.  As for the tearjerker scenes, the biggest one from the previous movie had me actually crying, and the revisiting of it failed in comparison.",none,,2021-03-08 16:28:22.804854,0

There is no reason behind it as no one explained it. Same as Captain America passing the mantle to the black actor which is more bulls to me. Not because he is black, obviously, but because he is a simple human and just having the shield is not going to make him a superhuman like Captain America. Finally how the movie deals with its ending is nonsensical. Clearly the writers had decided before end Iron Man was going to die and worked backwards but their writing was lazy. To see this glove being passed from superhero to superhero was laughable, not more so than when Captain Marvel took it and instead of taking the skies to avoid everyone she just flies through the enemies so she could confront Tanos and lose the hammer.

Endgame is a different type of movie. There's so much to cap and some many thing to bring to an end, that makes you overlook the plot devices, you understand why they make use of those conveniences to get the story going and to hit the finale of this 11 years of film making they have to delivery.

In this movie there's two Thanos' - present Thanos and a past Thanos from a different timeline. Present Thanos won. He did the snap and used the stones to destroy the stones. Then the heroes killed him, thus destroying the most interesting character in the past 11 years

What do they replace him with? A different Thanos that takes place roughly around the time of Guardians of the Galaxy 1. This is a Thanos that doesn't know about Stephen Stange, Antman (though Antman isn't really a power house) or Captain Marvel. Other than what he gleaned from present day Nebula. So what does he do? He takes his entire army and storms earth without any recon

This Thanos makes no sense to me. The only conclusion I have to make is that he doesn't know that the stones are requirements for a stable timeline (after all, present Thanos destroyed them) - if he had just stayed still in the past, the avengers would have had to return the stones to the past and some version of Thanos in the past would have replayed the main timeline

But I guess past timeline Thanos in a universe absent the stones wanted the stones and that was the only way to get them. Confused? I sure was.

But my main beef isn't with plotholes. It's with past Thanos making boneheaded moves. He could have teleported to the present and bided his time. He had spoilers (Nebula), his entire army, his children. If I were him, I would just replay the exact sequence of events - divide and conquer.

I dunno. This movie seriously ranks somewhere in the realm of Avengers 2 or Avengers 1 except with a bigger budget and much better CGI (look at Iron Man's suit in this movie - he doesn't look like a pastel colored CG man). The more I think about it, the more underwhelming it was. Infinity War was a much better movie. This ranks an entire letter grade below whatever IW was (if you think IW was an A, this is a B. If you think IW was an A+, this was a B+)

Good movie. I got my money's worth. But could've been so much better.",none,,2021-03-08 16:28:23.602428,2

The movie was mediocre with moments of greatness.

The good:
+ Captain America wielding Mjolnir was rewarding.
+ Everything Ant-Man
+ Scarlet Witch vs. Thanos
+ Most of the final battle
+ Hawkeye scene at the start
+ Nebula
+ Nothing major was changed with the Guardians.

The bad:
- What role does Captain Marvel play in this movie that Thor couldn't have?
- Why make Thor the most BAMF in the MCU in Infinity War only to give him anxiety and make him fat in Endgame?
- The whole support group scene was pointless. The beginnign was so slow.
- Regurgitating the same scenes from Infinity War to get the same emotional reactions was lazy. (see Hawkeye/Black Widow on Vormir and Spidey/Stark at the end.)
- Really, Captain America went back in time to hook up with Peggy? What about her husband and life? No pay-off. What about Sharon Carter? Jesus the Russo's you can't keep up with your own movies?
- Honestly, what the eff. Thor got Stormbreaker and hunted down Thanos in IW only to become a fat fuck, abandon Stark in space and stop seeking revenge? The Thor from IW would have torn the universe apart looking for Thanos.
- Final battle ""girl group selfie"". You know the scene...
- All the voice overs...
-  The whole Ant-Man selfie scene.
- The whole drunk Thor scene with in the cabin.
- Banner Hulk.
- In the Final Battle I was so hoping when Thanos' ship started shooting into space that it would have been the Silver Surfer/Galactus. You don't just wipe out half of someone's lunch without the doing something about it.
- America's ass, really?
- Every ""passing the torch"" scene felt forced. The movie was poorly paced.

""Losers."" 


And I was one of them. 
When Iron Man came out, I remember as an avid comic reader thinking ""wait? They're actually making a movie out of this? That's impossible! Man, what if they made an Avengers movie one day? That could never happen, too many logistics. But man... wouldn't that be something.""


I have never been more honored to be a comic book fan than I am today. 
As I sat there in the exact same theatre where I watched every previous Marvel film, for the last time, I realized how much better cinema was for it. This film was as unbound as the imagination of Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, who never had to let budgetary restrictions or any other nonsense limit their imaginations. All they had to do was draw it. Now movies are only as limited as a writer's imagination, to never be restricted again. 
Thank you Kevin Fiegge. 
Thank you Stan Lee. 
Thank you Jack Kirby.

It ends many story arch’s. It has bitter sweet moments some sad moments and some great happy endings. With that said I had one huge beef with this movie and some minor trivial issues. My biggest disappointment is the way hulk was portrayed not just in this movie but in the entire arch of the character. I loved hulk when he was first introduced in the avengers slowly the character was dumbed down and kind of gelded. He kept getting weaker. In the original infinity war and the animated versions hulk was instrumental. He played a major roll in Thanos demise. I get the whole banner hulk merger. But feel they weakened that character as well. So that’s my big beef. Now, a few things trivial that bothered me enough to mention. I felt like the emotional reunions were to darkened. Should of had more tones of joy and relief. Some of the time travel scenes felt forced and like they were trying to hide the scenes at the same time. There going back to Asgard and trying to show and hide a pivotal character Jane. Also, would have liked to see a bit more power play between captain marvel and thanos not just a head but that made thanos faulted a little. Final thought I love the torch passing from the old captain America to the new one. An epic movie an epic ending definitely will see again.",none,,2021-03-08 16:28:24.016185,0

The director is television at the most, fields and counter-shots in the dialogues and some overview in the final battle ... end. I count a long field only if I'm not mistaken ... and the film lasts three hours. Considering then that Thanos was an interesting character here reduced to a mere bad guy ... bye bye.
How can you spend millions and millions and go out with these films? and many say that the final battalion is LOTR style; evidently they haven't seen him, because Jackson is on another galaxy.
And I'm criticizing the director, let's forget about the actors and the script, otherwise they'll bury themselves.

A chapter on comedy; Blake Edwards used to say that a gag is not such if there is not a bit of naturalness in it ... and I agree very well, here now it seems that the jokes should be under contract and many of them are out of tune, because they kill the next scene or previous.
Thor, for example, could also be good for a turn of the genre, but an Edwards would have drawn from this character his comic side because he is the reality itself to be comic, to then reveal the tragic or existential bitterness resided behind this funny situation . Obviously the Russians put it on the demential (mediocre), because it's easier for them and for the general public and so everything goes to hell
The turning point after the first 20 minutes could open up to so many things, and instead waste it.

she was way too important to the plot, and it felt forced. i wish someone sacrificed her for the soulstone, but then she would need someone to actually like her in the first place...",none,,2021-03-08 16:28:24.207958,0

I keep using this phrase as it is what is stuck in my head. Endgame: An exquisite, poetic love letter to 11 years of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.  The fanservice is there but here is the beautiful thing about it.  Unlike the Force Awakens where you really are only referencing 3 prior movies when you do nods to the fans.  (Millennium Falcon lightsaber drone ball)  Marvel has 11 years and 21 movies to dilute the callbacks in.  Nothing felt forced.  Everything felt like it was a memory emerging and when it happened you smiled as anyone who has seen those movies was along for that memory.  It made things feel more impactful.
And respectfully I disagree with Chris on the slow burn on the first 30 minutes.  It's not a slow burn.  Its kindling.  We needed the repercussions to feel real as this is a direct continuation of Infinity War.  We needed to see what happens to not only our heroes but the world.  How it tore them down mentally and physically.  That set the stage for the second half of the movie.  It made their struggle feel all the more real instead of just another battle and struggle to fight over.  We all know they were fighting for all those who vanished.  But that setup made the payoff all the better.

As for the movie itself.  I don't even know what to say.  I'm still unpacking it in my head.  If you come at it like its just another summer blockbuster action film,  you'd be right.   But spend an hour.  Or in my case 3 damn hours laying in bed until 3AM GAH!!  Thinking about it, the Russo brothers weaved a plot that threads its way through most of those 11 years.  Some are obvious due to the plot.  Some are not so obvious until you think about it.  It is a perfect bookend to this series.

I had a Erika moment last night at 2AM.  I honestly think the MCU is the journey of Tony Stark. Yes you have other super heroes throughout those 11 years. But think about it. Who's character arc has progressed and matured the most over those 11 years? Where the end came full circle to the beginning? News Conference.....I am Iron Man.

How the film ties up other MCU together into one film is seamlessly brilliant and brings an monumentally outstanding conclusion. I could go on for agesss, there’s so many good things. 

Upmost respect to the cast and crew, to put this film together is a phenomenal achievement.

It wasn't just a stream of action (which Is what IW kind of felt like), and because of that I think it's the better movie overall. Plus, the last scenes were just epic. I was crying and laughing from start to finish.",none,,2021-03-08 16:28:24.632749,0

It definitely is the epic blockbuster promised. I've only had two disappointments about specific issues, issues that only Marvel purists would/will understand when they watch the movie. But those issues aside, I highly recommend going to watch this movie and also would advise no bathroom breaks or getting munchies. Get all your stuff done before taking your seats and buckle up till the end! I don't know if there's many Marvel purists and not just MCU fans on this channel? And yes there's a big difference between the two, ""Marvel purists"" are die hard Marvel Universe fans and have been since the 60's-70's and usually have a good collection in their basements and can recall story lines of past till this present day, they know their characters and all that entails from that knowledge. And they (me included) don't like when the MCU strays away too much from the true Marvel characters for their MCU movies. So far, the MCU has done a great job trying to stick to the Marvel characters as close as possible. Which is the biggest reason why they've been so successful for the last 10 yrs with this precious franchise they were gifted with and asked to bring to life on the big screen. 

MCU fans are true fans that have loyally followed the MCU from the start and know more about MCU characters than just casual fans (movie goers) and are ok with any and all changes the MCU made to the original Marvel characters to fit the MCU narratives and specific characteristics traits of the Marvel characters because they don't really know the Marvel Universe comic book characters. Marvel purists on the other hand, know the true Marvel characters like they know their family members and aren't so forgiving and notice quite fast any changes made to any original Marvel characters. Marvel purists are like the gate keepers and are quick to cringe when the MCU makes drastic changes to any Marvel book characters and we're not quiet about it either. The true Marvel universe fan base are what makes the majority of MCU movie goers, they still collect comic books, purchase movie tickets/comic books memorabilia's and also acquire the more expensive collectible items. 

I'm not saying MCU fans don't do the same, but they do it on a much much smaller scale. I don't think a MCU fan would be ready and willing to cough up close to $50 K's for my collection in order for them to acquire a collection (turnkey) instead of starting one from scratch. But a true Marvel purist who most likely already has a collection, would want to take a closer look at my collection and after appraisal would (if able) seriously consider buying my collection to add to their own. Disney/Marvel needs to always consider this and in a small way continue to try to cater to that bottomless well of true Marvel universe purists, which will remain faithful to their last breath, just as long as MCU doesn't stray too far away from the original Marvel characters and understand that any changes, small or big to any character will have a ripple effect in the MCU that they need not only to consider but to work with to balance both characters (one being a Marvel character and the other being a MCU character).  


P.S. My collection is not for sale, I gave it to my son as a family heirloom and he's decided to continue growing it himself even though he knows he could easily get big $ for it right now. His decision actually brought tears to my eyes.",none,,2021-03-08 16:28:25.261841,0

End game was great and all but kinda bad compared to what it could have been. They made Thor a weak joke for the entire film, he should have been fat for the first part then got serious given the circumstances. Hated how even captain America was stronger than Thor with Thors own hammer. Captain Marvel was almost like superman, just flying in and destroying everyone (and basically Thanos had he not surprised her with the power stone) without breaking a sweat making all the other hero’s almost unnecessary (again like superman). Hulk was pathetic, he’s the only character whose gotten far weaker since his first film and the blending of Hulk and Banner IMO was terrible. One good part was captain America picking up Thors hammer, which was also a bad part as he made Thor look weak. I did really enjoy the film, but a few tweaks to some of the characters power levels and more of a serious tone given the films circumstances would have improved it a lot. I love all of the comedy Thor and Star lord are my favourite characters, but there’s a time and a place in infinity war they nailed the comedy it’s was subtle enough to not take away from what was happening, the same can’t be said for End Game unfortunately",none,,2021-03-08 16:28:25.262955,1

Answer me on this! 

Hulk is OK after said act, and will get better? Very Likely?

Mr Pym should be alive again? More particles can be made?

Can another glove not be made for said person to use once again once he's better to undo the ""very end""?

Just a theory but a valid one, or is that somehow impossible given that the ""very end"" was completed by the fellow who used the glove?

I sit rather uneasy with this idea that there are a few loop holes unanswered giving that banner is OK and the next clever boy after stark and of course jarvis/Friday or what ever it's name is now still has all that been designed still there to be remade, and of course the dwarf king Eitri could produce another said item?

it leaves so many unanswered questions and a hint of hope that stays with you.
for endgame though i do feel they should have made this into a 2 part story with the big battle being seperated into 2 places. like in infinity war. and for it to last longer for everyone to get their fight on.

i feel the good parts were over too soon and they stuck with scenes that were too slow in pace.

which is weird because absolute no one dies that was not expected. in actual fact the whole lot of them survived except cheesy sacrifices.

they literally spent over 20 movies building this universe up with lore, plot and the rest. So why waste so long having everyone crying and being morbid? yeah we get it , they lost, but endgame should have been a three hour slug fest, not some nostalgia trip , rehashing every movie they previously did. to be fair im fed up of the same structured story over 20+ films.

Endgame is a good name, as it is the end of the game for me with this franchise, especially after infinity war took us back to something good, then they released this nonsense.

just ask yourself when your going to get fed up of every good guy surviving, every bad guy getting his medicine and karma, beautiful women with the hero, inspirational father figure or uncle dying. it is cheesy and not worthy of rememberance.

Pros. 
. I really like how important a roll Nebula played in the film
.the final fight was the best thing I’ve ever seen 
. The plan off going back in time was really cool and enjoyed that

Cons 
. Black widow was done dirty. I didn’t feel an impact on her death and her being my fave character wasted it a bit
.characters like black panther and the one that’s vanished basically weren’t in the film. Think doctor strange had like 2 lines also the same with captain marvel 
. The start was really a bit to long. I enjoyed it, but it felt nothing really happened in the first hour

Over all,  was a really good film. The plot was really fun but infinity war was better 🤷🏼‍♂️",none,,2021-03-08 16:28:25.654911,0

Scroll on down......



Negatives

-Too slow to start
-Not anywhere near enough action for 3 hours
-Serious Kill Bill V2 vibes
-Time Travel BS is 50% of the film
-Mopey superheroes is the other 50%
-It's hard to care when Ironman dies because he is a -prick
-They could've used the gauntlet to kill Thanos at any point during the big climax
-Captain America just turns old .... Not very heroic
-They ruined Hulk and Thors look and character
-Not enough Hulk smashing, actually I don't think there was ANY Hulk smashing
-Thor is just a half funny comedy act now. 
-Captain Marvel is just sorta there and shows up just at the right moments
-Captain America is now powerless and boring Falcon! lmao
-30 mins too long
-Basically no surprises
- So many time travel plot holes
- No where near enough action or excitement for a 3 hour film, let alone a 3 hour superhero movie ffs
- Thanos was ruined


+ The shot where the superhero army shows up is awesome
+ Captain America Vs Captain America
+ The 3ish Loki lines
+ Killing Thanos in first 10 minutes was unexpected
+ Good acting all round
+ CGI is very good

I saw the film this morning at a 03:30 IMAX screening.  After sitting through at least 6 trailers (eternity), it felt like the film would never start.  When it did, the cinema f*cked up by playing the 3D version instead and had to restart with the correct 2D showing... We were initially annoyed but cheered when the showing stopped before getting too far in. 
 
**Giant sigh**

HOWEVER, when the film began to roll it was plain sailing.  People may have an issue with the initial pace that starts slow, however I'd liken it Breaking Bad - ie slow but necessary to really flesh out the world and characters after the events of the snap.  Personally I found the world / character building to be one of the stronger elements of the film, which made the whole thing feel plausible, satisfying and entertaining.  

For those worried about CAPTAIN MARVEL, I fully TRUSTED the Russo brothers ability to *direct* actors and was SATISFIED with how they utilised her...

I've been sceptical on reports about people crying multiple times throughout.  I hate to add to the cliché but I found myself GENUINELY welling up on multiple occasions.  The stakes truly felt real and there was a balanced mix of emotions...

I had a few gripes on certain technical aspects that made me raise an eyebrow... that said, the few bits that didn't work in that respect were, in my opinion, completely overshadowed by all the working elements of the film. 

CONCLUSION, if you do see it theatrically, watch it in IMAX.  Where INFINITY WAR felt a little rushed and borederline lacklustre (thinking of the Battle for Wakanda mainly) - this was the quickest 3 hours I'd ever sat through and I was left wanting MORE by the end...",none,,2021-03-08 16:28:26.236418,5

Scott Lang is in the quantum realm for 5 years and this is shown by the age of his daughter Cassie when he meets her. The thing that is annoying me is why at the end when we see the likes of Ned Leeds and he hasn't aged and is still in high school? I get that the Hulks snap brings back the characters that disintegrated back as they were but you can't say Iron Mans snap rewrote the last 5 years. If that was the case his daughter would either be a tiny baby or not even born. Peter Parker is 15 in homecoming and you finish high school in America at 18 so what I'm saying is how can he return to high school as if 5 years hasn't passed and his mates are all the same age.

It is a great superhero film, a well developed, impactful, fun, entertaining and satisfying epic event style film, an emotional movie with fantastic acting, writing and directing and a wonderful ending that ties everything up allowing it to go full circle. It is a great culmination and conclusion with plenty of nods, references and Easter eggs to the previous 21 films and the comics. Thanos was great and I immensely enjoyed his and everyone else's character arcs. They even made Hawkeye into a great character. They did everyone justice and set it all up in a fun, funny, entertaining manner. The last hour of the film was freaking phenomenal. I give it a 95/100, 9.5/10 and a solid A. Some cgi could of been better and one or two characters could of been used more but those are nitpicks. It's awesome. Check it out. If you're a superhero fan, a comic book fan or an MCU fan, this movie is for you. If not, you'll still like it. It works as a great character drama film, too. Sorry about ranting. But, I loved it. Also, the 3 hours flew by but it started a little slow. But, it was necessary for character and story growth and was worth it. Don't stay until the ending.

It has everything, its really a great movie, thats how epic superhero movies should be made! Its a 10/10 for me. 
Now on a very personal note, theres one thing that i really didnt liked, its something that has been bugging me since the very beginning..i know most people wont even care. But i personally care and i hate the fact that theyve made the Hulk insanely weak in the MCU! I mean, hes missing most of his abilities, like his invulnerability to magic for exemple, or his ability to adapt to literaly everything or anyone, or his regerenation powers which are the best of all Marvel’s superheros are almost nonexistant in the MCU..even his infinite stamina is missing! Theres a lot more of his powers/abilities that are missing in this version of the Hulk, and the ones that he has are extremely weak! I dont get why theyve made him like that...its ridiculous and very frustrating for a Hulk fan like me. The Hulk has always been my favorite character, ive read everything about him, i know a lot about this character and it sucks that they didnt took advantage of this amazing character! Hes not even close to be like he is in the comics, they should have made him at least a bit closer to how he is in the comics imo. But no, they had to make him extremely weak..hes missing most of his powers, and the ones he has are very weak! I mean even his strength is not even close to be how it should be, as well as his regeneration powers, hes barely able to heal himself when hes hurt, when in fact the Hulk has the best regeneration powers of all Marvel’s superheros! 
Anyway, like i said its very personal, i love the Hulk so much and i find it very disappointing to have this weak/pahetic version of the Hulk in such an amazing franchise! Because beside the Hulk character, everything else was insanely good in this movie, i really loved it!",none,,2021-03-08 16:28:26.486756,0

Nervous fans were awaiting how the story unfurled.
They whispered and wondered, How would this all end?
Since one year ago, Thanos killed half their friends.

Be patient, be patient — just one more sleep.
Alarms have been set, they're ready to beep.
The date had now come for the Endgame premiere;
Cannot wait any longer, the conclusion was near.

To the theater they dashed, clutching tickets in hand;
They then took their seats for the 3-hour stand.
The room slowly darkened, the screen had gone black;
Viewers covered in goosebumps from the Endgame soundtrack.

The opening scene: Tony floating in space
With a look of deep sadness betraying his face.
Berating himself, Was all this for naught?
A final sad message for his love Pepper Potts.

Nebula walked on by, a gentle touch on his shoulder;
She sensed something new — Tony’s will had grown bolder.
Not like this, Tony muttered, He’s not getting me too.
And the duo arrived to Avengers HQ.

The audience gasped, they clapped, and they cheered
For the OG Avenger was finally here!
The team now assembled, they needed a plan.
The audience knew: they needed Ant-Man.

Steve worried and worried; he tightened his jaw.
He thought of the plan — Was there any flaw?
Avenge the friends who had fallen: Bucky, Scarlet Witch.
Without hesitation, Let's go get this son of a bitch.

They hopped in their spaceship, Captain Marvel at helm
But poor Scott Lang — stuck in the quantum realm!
On their way to fight Thanos, they followed the stones;
Each hero was ready deep down in their bones.

The mad titan Thanos was waiting with glee,
And where did that bring you? Back to me.
No battle more important; never higher, the stakes.
Together they cried, Whatever it takes.

Their butts, they got kicked! An ass-whooping, if you will;
A Marvel nerd scoffed, They didn’t have Beta Ray Bill..
Back home they crawled, desperation at hand
When Scott Lang arrived in an old, beat-up van!

A time vortex! Scott cried, That’s how we can win!
We have to try, Widow added, no matter how slim.
A new strat was brewing: make the timelines anew.
You trust me? Tony asked. Cap nodded, I do.

They put on new suits, sleek black, white, and red.
Get the stones before Thanos — they’ll time skip instead!
You know your teams and your missions, Cap reassured all;
There’s no time to waste, no more chances to stall.

At this point, dear readers, I can’t guess the plot
But oh, it was glorious! Our heartstrings were taut.
No character safe, truly anything goes
Behind the masterminds of our dear Russo Bros.

But know this, my friends, the story was grand
And we would all witness our heroes’ last stand.
They fell again and again, but never surrendered;
The most beautiful movie a Marvel fan would remember.

With the purple guy bested, the Avengers had won.
Their friends were un-dusted, the fighting was done.
The audience wept, and the credits then rolled.
The saga was finished, the tale had been told.

Like an astral projection came All-Father  Stan Lee
With a tear in his eye for all he could see.
His heroes were heroes; he could want nothing more.
Happy Endgame to all, and to all, Excelsior!",none,,2021-03-08 16:28:26.697012,0

Three weeks later, Carol Danversrescues Nebula and Tony Stark, who are stranded in space following their defeat by Thanos. They return to Earth where they rendezvous with Natasha Romanoff, Bruce Banner, Steve Rogers, Rocket, Thor, Pepper Potts and James Rhodes. The team tries to retrieve the Infinity Stones from Thanos to reverse his actions, but finds that he has destroyed them to prevent any further use. Thanos is decapitated by Thor.

Five years later, Banner has merged with the Hulk and Thor has become the drunken ruler of Asgard's refugees in Tønsberg, Norway. Scott Lang escapes from the quantum realm[N 2] and finds Romanoff and Rogers at the Avengers' compound, theorizing that the quantum realm can allow time travel. The three propose to Stark—now raising a daughter, Morgan, with Pepper—that they travel back in time to retrieve the Infinity Stones and return them to the present to undo Thanos' actions. Stark initially rejects out of concern for Morgan, but relents after reflecting upon the loss of Peter Parker and designs a working time machine.

The reunited Avengers split into groups for their mission. Banner, Rogers, Lang, and Stark travel to the Battle of New York[N 3] to retrieve the Time, Mind, and Space Stones. Banner visits the Sanctum Sanctorum and convinces the Ancient One to give him the Time Stone, and Rogers overcomes undercover Hydraagents and his past self to retrieve the Mind Stone. Lang and Stark's failed distraction enables Loki to escape with the Space Stone. Rogers and Stark travel back further to the U.S. Army's Camp Lehigh in 1970[N 4] to steal both an earlier version of the Space Stone and vials of Hank Pym's size-altering Pym Particles to return home afterwards. The pair succeed, while meeting Peggy Carter and Howard Stark en route.

In Asgard, Rocket and Thor retrieve the Reality Stone from Jane Foster.[N 5] Thor encounters his mother Frigga, whose counsel restores his conviction, and obtains a past version of his hammer, Mjolnir.[N 6] Barton and Romanoff travel to Vormir for the Soul Stone. They learn from its keeper, Red Skull, that it can only be retrieved by sacrificing someone they love. After a struggle between the two, Romanoff sacrifices herself.

On Morag, Nebula and Rhodes steal the Power Stone before Peter Quill can do so.[N 7]Rhodes returns to the present with the Stone, but Nebula is left stranded behind as her cybernetic implants interface with those of her past self, which Thanos exploits and learns of present-day events. He sends the past incarnation of Nebula to the present in present-day Nebula's place.

As Banner activates the Infinity Stones to resurrect everyone killed by Thanos, past Nebula uses the time machine to transport Thanos and his ship from the past to the present day. Rogers, Thor, and Stark confront Thanos, though he overpowers them, even when Rogers proves able to wield Thor's hammer. Thanos summons the Black Order and his armed forces, but the revived Avengers arrive on the battlefield, along with the Sanctum Sorcerers and the armies of Asgard and Wakanda. Present-day Nebula convinces past Gamora to turn on Thanos, and in the ensuing standoff Nebula kills her past self. Stark eventually retrieves and activates the Infinity Stones, which disintegrates Thanos and his army. Stark is mortally wounded in the process.

Following a funeral for Stark, Thor appoints Valkyrie queen of Asgard and joins the Guardians of the Galaxy. After returning the Infinity Stones and Thor's hammer to their original timelines, Rogers chooses to travel back and live his life in the past with Carter. He arrives as an elderly man and passes his shield onto Sam Wilson.",none,,2021-03-08 16:28:26.698466,0

Thank u so much for paying off the 10 years we had invested in ur franchise 

Im aware ur most likely goung to go in a racist and sexist direction in the future 
& i cant supporr any type of sexism or racism that is often proposed by the movements ur imvolved in 
So i cant see me being a part of ur future 
Although I will watch this space for what u do in the future, in hope it's done fairly

But whatever u end up doing 
I am grateful u pulled back a lot and allowed the pay off we deserved with this film

I wont lie
I always pay my way
Go cinema or wait for a DVD release
But I have streamed this film, yes illegally!
I dont endure that at all
But I had to kmow what i was paying to support
I will now be going cinema & paying fairly to u
Now i know the movie isnt pushing a political agender
And isn't forcing an idea that women are stronger than men or men are stronger than women
Or black or white agenders

I felt the women were strong in this film 
The men were strong
Both sex's had strengths and weaknesses 

U hope u decide against bre or u at least demand she doesnt use ur platform for hate towards any1 anymore 
If she does that as her personal project thats up to her but i hope u dont allow it for ur movies 
If u do...
I am out, but i will not be slagging it off anymore
I will instead be ignoring it and walking away
Because i am grateful u gave us this ending to our 10 years of investment 

I wpuld be outraged if u jad denighed us this 

White male, white female
Black male, black female
There is no reason to make a big deal of us 
Single any1 out for better or for worse
Just allow growth to happen naturally 
Teach poor societies that harf work gives positive results 
Not hate for colour or a different sex 
Base reward on a persons achievements 
On their choices 
Not like bre has done with the platform u gave her
Hate on any1 who works hard is wrong and u know it is

Thank u anyway

I just didn't get true sense of the devastating of when Thanos clicked his fingers. He erased half the life in the entire universe and all we got were people vanishing on a battlefield, in New York (always New York, seriously... New York again... okay) and some of the Avengers. What about people across the globe, what about half the life in the universe, the entire universe. Other planet's, other species, other civilisations. And all we get were some people in a battlefield in a fictional African city, New York (New York again) and some Avengers. Can't help but feel the movie could have done with an extra twenty, thirty minutes to give a greater sense of what Thanos did. I know Endgame will build on this but for Infinity War could have benefited with a better idea of the amount of lives that were erased. Personally I'd rate Infinity War a B-. Not yet seen Endgame, don't really have much hype for it myself. I'll catch it in a few weeks if I have time or honestly be bothered.

Hype is strongly needed in this movie.

More hype, means that more people really want to watch it as soon as possible.

Perhaps I hyped myself up but I felt that it wasn’t completely satisfying and felt rushed and loose in many places, if anything it created more confusion than closure. 

SPOILERS AHEAD!!!!


1. Thor: he was so epic and amazing in IW so I get that they would want to shine light on someone else, but they really just said “fuck it” to Thor’s whole character. He’s character arc lead to something so epic and all we got to see in this final movie was him being fat and basically comedic relief. That felt really cheap to me. 

2. Black Widows death: this one is kinda hard to explain. The only reason why I find this upsetting is because her death ruined the whole idea of an epic final OG6 avenger moment that a lot of people including myself were hyped up about. 

3. The whole time travel plot: I get that I’m no film director or writer, but I felt that it could of been written out better. It seemed like just fanservice trying to incorporate past roles into the scene just because. I know it’s hard to do but the whole team plan, even though it’s the most logical way to go from it kinda split the team apart which bugged me as it leads into the next flaw. 

Lack of og6: the avengers movie should be focused on the avengers team. The last 2 movies basically developed their relationship and hyped it until this. I got that IW wanted to put a lot of secondary characters to weave the whole mcu together but I really hope that in doing that, endgame would be very og6 focussed. It kinda was but they were still split apart which diminishes the epicness of the og6 team. Even so, they didn’t even have that iconic og6 moment which made me super upset. It is their movie series so I really wanted it to really show them together and fighting together as a last tribute to the original team, yet they didn’t even share a fight together so if anything it wasn’t very satisfying and I felt incomplete. 

Cliche moments: I know i might get a bit bashed for this but I found the whole girls fighting together at the end of the movie very forced and cringy, tbh just trying to shove political/feminist stuff to impress the audience which is getting overused and boring, i kind of don’t like that stuff getting overly done and forced into films. All about girl power but not when it’s just shoved in your face. There were other things such as some of the humour which felt forced and dry, wasn’t as memorable as IW even so just idk a lot of scenes in the film I didn’t really click with or enjoyed. 

Hulk/ Bruce Banner: yea that whole character arc was also done shit. Once again I’m not a director or writer so I can’t really say much but as a viewer, I felt that the hulk/ Bruce banner arc was ruined completely in this movie along with Thor. It felt rushed and cheap and didn’t really give a lot of development or closure to Bruce’s character, once again just adding random stuff last minute to try and solve/ end his arc in a crappy way. Not only that but we didn’t see a hulk vs thanos rematch which I and many other were anticipating. 

Steve’s ending: a lot of people have also shared similar views as me in this context which is Steve’s ending. It felt to fanfic/ fan service to just put him back in time to be with Peggy. Yeah it’s cute and he deserves happiness but a lot of plot holes happened because of that; how it could affect the whole timeline and just the fact that he’s choice meant that nothing for his past 10 years in the present day or the risks and responsibilities he had meant to him. Idk I wanted captain to have a heroic epic death but they once again made a cheap send off to which they didn’t pay attention to the massive plot holes that were created. Just seems like poor story writing and how it was executed. 

Yea I know it sounds very nit-picky and im usually those who enjoy movies easily but I feel like as a fan from the very start, I saw all the development and hype of each solo and avenger films that were made and the character arcs that were built to lead up to this 3 hour movie which really didn’t satisfy me as much and just felt very incomplete, inconsistent and rushed/poorly made. I believe they could of established a better storyline that could be a epic rightful tribute and ending to the past amazing films that lead up to this and the og6 avengers which were the start to this whole cool universe. With all the hype and 7 years of story and character creating, i feel like this as a final film was kind of a let down.",none,,2021-03-08 16:28:28.375027,0

Couple of things though- I think they purposefully made the 1st act ""slow"" so you could really connect with the characters which makes the final hour even more impactful, a bit like an orchestra starting off with a solo, then strings added, slowly building pace and finishing with every section.
As a culmination of 20+ films they had such a tough job tying it all together but they've done it so well. Admittedly a few characters didn't get the screen time or development we'd have liked to have seen but to do so would have probably pushed the running time to 3h 20m at least so they probably made the right choice.
Infinity War is a brilliant superhero movie, Endgame is more than that, it's a brilliant movie full stop.

Cinemasins does this a lot of times and there is a reason why noone takes them seriously when making their EWW's. First of all, don't you want a good movie to last longer? I in fact complain about movies that have too short of a runtime, as movies generally feel like it is very hard for them to tell a compelling enough story in a runtime shorter than 2 hours (and even two hours, I personally consider short for some movies) There are movies, which of course, don't need a longer runtime (requiem for a dream is a perfect example) but generally, movies NEED longer runtimes, with the condition that the story is compelling, and it's worth that RUntime.

I know it's going to be good, but I nitpick the heck out of movies.  When I went to go see Red Tails, I stormed out of the theatre because they weren't flying the right model of P-51, completely skipping over the Tuskeegee Airmen's time flying the B/C models (The planes they are best known for) and skipping right to the D Model.  (There's a lot more to nitpick about that movie that I didn't pick up on at the time, for one , if you are thinking about going head to head with a 262 in a Mustang, don't.  Just don't.  Their guns are bigger than yours)

Having said, there are movies I love that really don't make sense when you nitpick them, but I still love them, such as Iron Eagle.

And then there is Kelly's Heroes, where they have a line of dialogue where they explain why the Shermans they used had the wrong sized barrel.  I liked that.  I loved that movie in general.  And Oddball is probably one of my favorite movie characters of all time.

I guess the point I am trying to make is, don't watch Red Tails, but do watch Iron Eagle and Kelly's Heroes.",none,,2021-03-08 16:28:29.018706,0

NO SPOILERS!
The major problem, to me, is that it has no boundaries. There's tons of stuff happening, things fans really want to see, things I really wanted to see.. But there's just so many ideas crammed into this film, that it becomes a big mess. There's no structure, constant switch of tone from emotion to humor, characters do things that are completely out of character and overboard. Infinity War added a whole lot of things, but knew where to stop. I really don't want to be THAT guy because I love Marvel, but even though this film was very exciting, I don't think it was a success.

Like Korg and Miek being more walking jokes than actual characters or how Fury lost his eye. They may be small moments but in the end the joke is never worth it to me and they don't do those characters any favors.

I just got back from the film a couple hours ago and I agree with most of your points (especially regarding the third act being pure movie magic)!
Overall though, I thought the pacing for the film was great. I was never bored during the first act as this film really did need all that time to set up the plot and direction for acts 2 and 3.
Also it needs to be said: you say this is a spoiler free review and I really respect that - but saying that you cried, basically is a spoiler! It means that obviously something sad or very emotional occurs in the film and in a film that is set-up as a finale of sorts - I think that is definitly a spoiler.
Really did enjoy your review and look forward to your proper spoiler review 😊",none,,2021-03-08 16:28:30.448109,0

Not with a bigger battle a snap and people dusted. Our heroes make things different from the villaisn, way different. ALSO ANYTHING WE WENT BLIND TO THESE MOVIE THANKS TO THE NEW SPIDERMAN TRAILER THAT IS COMING JUST IN 2 MONTHS BECAUSE DISNEY HAS NOT ENOUGH MONEY ALREADY THESE YEAR!! Not spoiled at all...

This movie gave me a chill reminisced of a Japanese anime I've seen. I think Marvel had committed a crime by ripping off cartoon from a different origin.

I went to an 'Avengers Night', and saw Infinity War and Endgame right after each other, with 30 minutes in-between. Everyone was hyped (there were a lot of die hards), and the atmosphere was.... amazing. In both IW and Endgame people started clapping at great moments, people gasped together, cried together, everything together. During the break, 2 or 3 persons started singing a birthday song because it was their friend's birthday. Everyone in the theatre started singing and clapping along (which was around 200 people). After the movie we all got a poster of Endgame (an advertisementposter of the cinema, so part of it isn't Endgame), which is cool. I was with my little brother but people started to ask our opinion anyway, and on the street there was this guy that noticed we saw Endgame and said: 'please no more spoilers I'm gonne watch it tomorrow', and some people gave him false spoilers (like Howard the Duck was great in this). This is just the tip of the iceberg, but this was one of the best experiences in the theatre I ever had. There is one more thing that happened but that is a spoiler, so click away.

Just one thing that bothers how is there going to be a guardians of the galaxy 3 without Gamora? I was also angry how black widow was killed I thought people that died for the soul stone could get brung back with the soul stone. They killed widow offf without her atleast having a solo movie first ? I really hope she gets brung back somehow. She’s been my favourite marvel character ever since she was in her first film. I feel like they did her dirty. Ik there’s going to be a black widow film next year but it’s going to be in the past before she died 😫😫. I want to see the present of her alive and well,none,,2021-03-08 16:28:31.282336,0

Although the ""Avengers 4"" have no surprise, the script is time travel , and the final boss is still thanos.  But there is barely no disappointment !Shocked to deep ! The rhythm and bright plots are moving without feeling the passage of time!  Laugh and sad point both reached the climax ! Almost all of the most important of the 22 films of Marvel's ten years have been reviewed, and the original characters have been filled up several times better !  The various stalks and bridges have culminated in the Marvel fans who have seen all the ten years movies !  The last big battle is the most Epic and magnificent scene in movie history ! Not only is the scene most Magnificent , but it also brings the audience's mood to the climax !  Beyond what is expected is the sacrifice of the Black Widow and Iron Man ! The damn Marvel ＂killed＂the two most expensive ones.  .  Especially the death of Iron Man, the sensation is the ultimate ! Even me who is almost never sentimental to the movie, it is inevitable that tears came out when I walk out of the theater ! 
Marvel ten years, SUPER EPIC level.  !  Marvel movies has  accompanied us for ten years.  From the Iron Man in 2008, a richman build cool armor, an imaginative science fiction story to the Thor, the Avengers, the Guardians of glaxay and then to the avengers 3 all the characters together, and then to the avengers 4.  The film universe and the story structure are getting bigger and bigger. More and more stories, characters, and settings in the original comic book have been put on the big screen, and the Marvel movie has also developed into a super phenomenon ! Marvel Film has created an era, and accompanied many people through a stage of life. The first time I watched Iron Man movies i was akid , now⋯Avengers 4 is the end of an era.  !  After watching it, my heart can be described as a mixture of five flavors and mixed feelings!  ""Avengers 4"" is undoubtedly an epic blockbuster ! The success of the Marvel movie universe is also a milestone in the commercial film and the film industry!  It will inspire more creators, and more comics, novels, and series stories will be put on the big screen in the future, and more movie universes will appear.  As the director said, ""Avengers 4"" is the end and the beginning.  Looking forward to the future DC &Marvel movie, I also look forward to more movie universe.  RIP Stan Lee.  Thanks to the Marvel movie for accompanied us for ten years .  !",none,,2021-03-08 16:28:31.282419,2

It wasn't that great. Infinity War was much better. It had good conclusions to the characters except one which I do not want to spoil now but overall I felt the movie quite boring at times and it could have been a much shorter film. There is at least 30 minutes of ""funny"" gag scenes that could have been eliminated all together. Captain Marvel's character was irrelavant (thank goodness), and the scenes she was in was probably one of the worst parts of the movie and there is one SPECIFIC scene that the cringe almost swolled me whole. It felt like the Russo brothers did a great job where they had the liberty to do so but Disney's agendas destroyed some of the narratives of the universe.

Absolutely NOTHING will prepare you for a 3 hour Geekfest!

And lemme tell you, the Net rumors about Steve Rogers saying farewell, well, It's a farewell but on a methaphorical, time- tampered goodbye kind of way, lemme just tell all the fans, Nothing that the Net rumors / plot theories describe what's gonna happen within the last Hour. Absolute Geekfest! The whole theater, young and old, able and disabled, war-torn geek and MCU newbie, everyone jumped, cheered and cried(I mean, massive wailing!) at A certain Hero's funeral service. He was there at the beginning, He was there at the end. and if you think the Captain Marvel movie was women empowerment, fellow geeks, you have no idea what Avengers Endgame is gonna show. The women! The Women! The whole marvel universe women!!! are gonna steal some glory for only a few moments BUT the moment was GLORIOUS!!! Even thor's coming in wakanda in Infinity War never comes close to it! and YES!!!! Captain America Wields a weapon he previously thought himself unworthy to bear(wink, wink!). And the immortal lines ""Avengers! Assemble!!"" When the good Captain utters it, not a few were having tears of joy. Well, I've spoiled enough folks, I'm gonna watch it again a few hours from now. Lastly, Thanos shows why he is the meanest, most egotistical, and unbelievably convincing Badass in the universe. I ca'nt type here what Cap Marvel does to him, though....

Fanservice can be a lot of things. It can make people jump out of their seats and scream along with the audience (spoilers for My Hero Academia movie, you've been warned), a good example of that is seeing Deku and All Might finish off the bad guy in the MHA movie with a Double Detroit Smash. That whole bit was fanservice but it felt amazing. 

Fanservice can also be heartwarming (see the entirety of Kimi no Na Wa or Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai)

(Spoilers for My Hero Academia season 3)
And it can even be soul destroying. It's a somewhat subtle example of fanservice that rewards people who really pay attention to the music to give that extra layer of emotion to the situation. In the show the hero All Might is fighting the biggest bad guy in the world. All Might is on his last legs, hes running on fumes and hes very close to dying. All Might is the symbol of peace for the world. Like if Captain America were given Superman levels of strength instead of Black Panther levels. The whole world is watching. And at the last moment, he thinks back to the words of his mentor who died fighting this same villain, and all she says is ""do your best, Toshinori (All Mights name)"". So he takes a page from his protege's book, something unexpected, he uses his right arm as bait for the villain to block, then hits him with an cross from the other side to knock him off balance. And then, finishes him off with one final, superman level punch. Perfect form and everything. And the music finally swells, and as he slams the villain into the ground so hard that he creates a tornado that lifts sections of buildings off the ground around them. The music goes from a dark menace, to a building anticipation, and then the final fanfare. And it's not just any swell, it's All Mights theme. The ""superman has come to save us"" melody. Honestly I'm crying just writing about it. And it becomes even more painful and sad but also triumphant when it's made clear that, even though he won, All Might used the last of his power and will never be able to be the world's symbol of peace again.


So yeah, fanservice isnt just cheap jokes that should be looked down on. There is nothing wrong with rewarding your fans for their attachment to your work by giving them emotional payoff.",none,,2021-03-08 16:28:32.480909,2

If The Last Jedi had less issues. Such as pacing (aka the Casino planet breaking up the pace) or Some lackluster characters (like Rose, Holdo, Snoke and a couple others).

If the Last Jedi lacked those more fundamental issues. Would fans have been more accepting of some of the more bold choices he made?

There are so many things wrong with this movie, that is hard to describe everything. If you make an analysis based only in the story and the direction, it`s already really bad. The movie, tells something and does another, the time travel is heavily bad; Hulk says that is impossible to change the present, however, they simply destroy everything, Thor gets his hammer from the past; Nebula kills herself; Black Widow sacrifice herself to get the Soul Stone, but Gamora still dead in the present.

Superherowise, this movie is also horrible, through the movie, you don`t feel you are seeing heroes talking to each other, but actors interacting with one another dressing like superheroes. The movie is a comedy movie with superheroes, action exists only in the final part of the movie.

Politicalwise, this movie is even worse, the feminism been pushed down our throats, Captain America passing over his shield to Falcon instead of Bucky, his best friend and with similar characteristics of his. Captain Marvel, the worst character in movies so far, arrogant and insanely overpowered; The future Avengers are all girls, Hawkeye Daughter; Ironman Daughter; Antman daughter; and even Peper Potts appears of nowhere if a nanotech armor, Really? But the thing that is worse than all, is Cap, the character who represents the great and old America, turning into a selfish and egoist guy, traveling back in time to be with Megan Carter, forgetting about Sharon, and acknowledging that Tony was right, the guy who made all the bad decision, trading freedom to false security, like the government tries to do.

In a Nutshell, this is a movie trying to brainwash you to think the what is bad is good and what is good is bad, with horrible writing, but great visual effects.",none,,2021-03-08 16:28:33.459355,1

The thing that may down and hurt Endgame a little is just the plot devices/convienences. There are some. When you watch them, you just realized that such person was somewhere at some perfect time just to... Or somebody is changed just because.... And so on and on. 

But!

Endgame is a different type of movie. There's so much to cap and some many thing to bring to an end, that makes you overlook the plot devices, you understand why they make use of those conveniences to get the story going and to hit the finale of this 11 years of film making they have to delivery. 

Movie wise, Infinity War is a better movie. Even the Avengers 2012 is. However in the big picture, when you see what Endgame means and represents you gotta say it's the biggest and more robust and more important movie of all MCU.

And boy do i got problems
I still like it but its not as good as infinity war

SPOILERS BELOW LOOK AWAY NOW



so they fridged black widow. After they fridged gamorra. Felt like it made more sense to kill hawkeye

They bring back thanos and gamorra at the end
Except they didnt. Since those arent the characters we grew to know so it rings rather hollow. ""Youll pay for what you did to me!"" ""I dont even know who you are!"" -actual lines in the movie from thanos-sums it all up. They killed off these characters to bring them back at the end in almost a cameo more than anything else yet their characters were now hollow shells of the ones we knew. Did we Need to see the old Nebula to understand the new? We already got to know her over 3 movies and see her develop we didnt need a reminder damn it
Also wtf happened to thanos' army in the present? No way most of them died in wakanda. Did they get wiped out in the snap?
I feel like all they had to do was Not kill thanos at the start and then bring back his army and bam now they got thanos there with all his character development we saw in Infinity War still intact. His character relationships intact.
We never get a ""stark? I know you"" moment with this thanos as he DIDNT KNOW ANY OF THEM! WHETHER VIA REPUTATION OR FIGHTING THEM IN THE LAST MOVIE!
Oh they gave an out to bring loki back by him disappearing with the tesseract.
Except he wont be back. Itll be a different loki. 
So bye bye character development. Also another time travel plot hole hurray.
They make a big deal about how they have to put everything back yet they just snap away thanos and his whole army. Also past nebula died so again time travel problems all over the place by that

And i swear did the Russo brothers hate thor ragnarok? These 2 movies undid everything from thor ragnarok and reduced thor to a giant joke
A funny joke sure, but again bye bye character development! 
Thor ragnarok turned thor into the leader he was always meant to be. They took away everything tore him down and became leader
Then the next movie he got it all back and then became a drunken idiot who said screw leadership im gonna go party with the guardians

Captain america killed his ex gf. The one from winter soldier
She was peggies daughter. He went back and married peggy instead. So wow. He literally killed that girl.
No set up for Falcon to become captain america. Made much more sense for that to go to bucky.
Instead they followed the comics
So now the super powered super soldier hero is replaced by someone without those powers who already had his schtick
when they got another guy right there who has powers and needs a renewed identity since hes no longer The Winter Soldier

Captain Marvel was to OP and despite so much build up to her being in the movie shes barely in it
I guess i get it its the sendoff to the old avengers but then dont focus so much on bringing in captain marvel as the lynch pin when all she did was destroy thanos' ship and run around with the gauntlet for a minute. Thats it.

Gotta say though it was awesome to see the entire marvel universe together for that battle

Tonys death. I liked it but i feel like they still could of done more with him going forward. Id rather of had him retire and appear occassionally than just kill him off.
I guess hes the new Uncle Ben for Peter
Also the entire world is in shambles most world governments have fallen according to natasha at the start of the movie yet seems like they are going to let the world carry on like little has changed. Really?!

Liked the idea of New Asgard. A town on earth made up of a group of super powerful semigodlike beings with knowledge of far superior tech
....and its just a fishing village? 
Also woulda liked to see the set up for that in maybe thor 4 rather than just being there. Oh well i guess?

Trash, absolute trash. I can’t believe so many ppl have talked about how great this thing was. There’s so many little moments of the film that I hated, but the concept of the film was the thing I hated most. They didn’t change their approach or strengthen themselves at all. They just went back in time to undo everything. It’s so fucking stupid to me that the Thanos they fight in the climax, isn’t even the Thanos that beat them in the first place! Like what, i thought the whole purpose of the movie was to strengthen themselves to confront Thanos again, and only after they make it past Thanos can they undo what he did. Not jus fucking ambush the guy and lop his head off. 

On top of that, it’s fucking stupid to resurrect 3.5 billion people 5 years after they’ve died. Not only is that shit jus completely unnatural (Avengers need to read the Monkey’s Paw), but that would just throw the world into chaos all over again. Could y’all imagine if 3.5 billion people jus showed up on the planet? What the hell do you do from there? Everybody that lost a spouse and has moved on to a new relationship is in trouble. Everybody who’s lost someone and has managed to move on is just being punished.
You can’t just disappear and reappear back in ppl’s lives and expect it to all be the same. I had a feeling that this movie was gone disappoint me, but damn I didn’t think it’d be that bad. Thanos went out like a punk man. And don’t even get me started on Captain America wielding that damn hammer like he was the next God of Thunder 😒 I get him lifting up Mjolnor, but did he really shoot lightning out that bitch?

I really like the character depths they gave in that first half.
That said, so many of these same characters were portrayed badly and could have been avoided. To the point that even their action scenes made me question whether the writers forgot about their role and prowess in IW (and other Marvel movies). Some characters were outright lame. The decision some made was also just like 🤔. Almost like the writers didn't think we would think at all, like we dumb.
In a few months or years time, true movie fans would nitpick the hell out of this movie. Many things just didn't make sense.

1. They make thor as a walking meme. A total joke. Even his power is shared with captain america

2. I know captain america finally will be able to lift mjolnir (based from previous avenger and ultron movie where he was able to flick mjolnir and surprised thor). But in Endgame how come he also able to fly and unleash thunder as if he was the god of thunder. WEIRD

3. CAPTAIN MARVEL WAS TOTALLY INSIGNIFICANT. Why bother made a movie 1 month prior to Endgame if she was not important at all. Infinity war credit scene totally misleading (as if she will have a great role) and the movie did not fulfill my expectation regarding her role

4. how could thanos and his big spaceship do time travel from 2014 to year 2019 ??
There is no clear explanation. Although we know evil nebula gave him pym particle and time GPS. 
But they dont have the equipment and apparatus like ant man to shrink the whole ship and space suit to do time travel!
And the most unacceptable thing is the whole ship time travelled !!!!

5. TONY STARK and BLACK WIDOW DEATH SCENE WAS USELESS. 
Imagine this: in the endgame movie there is a flaw regarding the time travel in which future and past character able to meet, even fight without affecting neither of the future and the past. 
We know that in the present timeline gamora died because she was sacrificed to be the soul stone. And thanos decapitated. 
But the past gamora and thanos in 2014 still alive and can do forward time travel to 2019, and still alive in the future (even destroy avenger headquarter etc)
Why dont they (the avenger) think of time travel into the past and grab the past natasha & tony stark to the present time. 
They still can be alive !!!! Maguna will still has a father and the world still have tony stark
The storyline itself is a flaw in my opinion. Lot of inconsistencies.
The death of iron man and natasha is not acceptable for some people who love them and they need better happy ending.

I know that some of the casts contract with MCU has ended, but thats not necessary to give them a dead ending. 
More than 10 years of character development, they can do better storyline than this

Nevertheless, this is a fictional superhero movie. Everything can happen, with or without clear reason.",none,,2021-03-08 16:28:34.895418,0

the only thing that was an issue was that captain marvel was a little too overpowered. 
she took out the mothership in like 10 seconds, the second that happened there were no longer any stakes for me because there was no point to the fighting anymore. I still cried at the end, but my brain was just saying the second she came and distroyed the big bad and clearly could single handedly destroy Thanos's entire army, they could have just passed the infinity stones back and let her finish off everything. there was no more stakes. they had the stones, they had the stronger group, they had the scientists who created the McGuffin so it lost its point. and a movie where the stakes are lost, also lose all its tension. 
It is the same with Justice League, when superman showed up at the end and took out the big bad easily i lost interest. because you can see clearly that he could finish it in an instant as long as he got serious. The stakes were gone.",none,,2021-03-08 16:28:35.096217,0

I honestly think that a lot of the moments in the film personally felt quite rushed and unexplored. They could have done so much more with the consequences of messing up with time (for example exploring ''the butterfly effect''). I expected the Avengers to screw up so much in the past, like making graver mistakes resulting from the tiniest changes that lead to a worse present than the one they they lived in, which would then make them realise that messing up with time was an error and end with them reverting to the original timeline in which Thanos won and was killed by Thor. Then it would end with a hopeful quote, narrated by each avenger about rebuilding the world and defending it until its end as we see them moving on with their lives.

The Butterfly Effect, a defining rule in any story involving time machines, is put on a shelf to justify all of the events happening in the movie. The explanation for how the future doesn't change even in case of severe altering of the past is flimsy at best, and completely terrible at worst. The excuse is pretty much that the current lineup of the Avengers create new timelines every time when they alter the past, while their own future gets untouched. Okay, let's believe that's how time travel works. That way, The Avengers have created multiple timeliness in which their other selfs will be faced with different outcomes of the events we already know. For example, in the original timeline of the first Avengers movie, the events are altered so that Loki escapes before he is sent to Asgard and he manages to get the Tesseract back. So in that timeline, Loki won. And in that same timeline, Hydra will figure out that Cap knows that they infiltrated the government because the future Cap pretends at one point to be Hydra, but the past Cap doesn't know of that. So Hydra will either try to kill Cap before he can even understand what is what or they will the start the Project Insight before the events of the Winter Soldier. Then they alter the timeline of Thor 2, where Rocket steals The Ether from Jane Foster before Malekith attacks Asgard, and that version of Thor will also lose his hammer because the future Thor stole it. And you maybe asking what's the problem here? The problem is that all of those different timelines are altered for the worse and they put those versions of the Avengers in the same jeopardy the new ones are facing. The future Avengers destroyed timeline of the past Avengers to save their own. And not only that, there's a big possibility of the past Avengers figuring out what has happened, and they can easily try to do what the future Avengers did and they can also try to go back in time to alter their timeline at the expense of others. Seriously, this movie is mind-fuckingly convoluted. Someone needs to write a tie-in book for the movie where all of this nonsense is at least explained at some capacity. Like in Interstellar, which got a tie-in book written by the scientist who supervised the science on the movie.",none,,2021-03-08 16:28:35.299545,3

Just saw the Avengers Endgame Movie....Twice
Review Brief!!! NO Spoilers!!!
The movie is three hours long so buy a snack or hide it from the security at your movie theater. Without spoilers, I can tell you that this movie has a lot of flaws. I've started negative to tell y'all that I don't really like it. I've seen all the movies and read mostly every comic book related to these events with Thanos. That includes even an idea or a mention of Thanos. There are to many directions in the movie only to create lots of plot holes. The introduction of Endgame is strong, but it didn't deliver, until the climax action scenes. I feel like I was watching Episodes of Avengers, instead of a movie. I laugh at many characters dialogue and had some emotions parts within the middle of the film. Then I've re-watched the movie... 😞The new characters didn't had any character development. You can certainly tell which characters this movie is made for, due to their salary and contract agreements, they didn't want to expand more. I fully understand that situation however, they used the same DAMN MINERAL. OVER AND OVER AGAIN! The movie is fill with great moments, but it's definitely a Disney movie. 😓 The creatively isn't there for this big budget firm.

It has everything, its really a great movie, thats how epic superhero movies should be made! Its a 10/10 for me. 
Now on a very personal note, theres one thing that i really didnt liked, its something that has been bugging me since the very beginning..i know most people wont even care. But i personally care and i hate the fact that theyve made the Hulk insanely weak in the MCU! I mean, hes missing most of his abilities, like his invulnerability to magic for exemple, or his ability to adapt to literaly everything or anyone, or his regerenation powers which are the best of all Marvel’s superheros are almost nonexistant in the MCU..even his infinite stamina is missing! Theres a lot more of his powers/abilities that are missing in this version of the Hulk, and the ones that he has are extremely weak! I dont get why theyve made him like that...its ridiculous and very frustrating for a Hulk fan like me. The Hulk has always been my favorite character, ive read everything about him, i know a lot about this character and it sucks that they didnt took advantage of this amazing character! Hes not even close to be like he is in the comics, they should have made him at least a bit closer to how he is in the comics imo. But no, they had to make him extremely weak..hes missing most of his powers, and the ones he has are very weak! I mean even his strength is not even close to be how it should be, as well as his regeneration powers, hes barely able to heal himself when hes hurt, when in fact the Hulk has the best regeneration powers of all Marvel’s superheros! 
Anyway, like i said its very personal, i love the Hulk so much and i find it very disappointing to have this weak/pahetic version of the Hulk in such an amazing franchise!

Nervous fans were awaiting how the story unfurled.
They whispered and wondered, How would this all end?
Since one year ago, Thanos killed half their friends.

Be patient, be patient — just one more sleep.
Alarms have been set, they're ready to beep.
The date had now come for the Endgame premiere;
Cannot wait any longer, the conclusion was near.

To the theater they dashed, clutching tickets in hand;
They then took their seats for the 3-hour stand.
The room slowly darkened, the screen had gone black;
Viewers covered in goosebumps from the Endgame soundtrack.

The opening scene: Tony floating in space
With a look of deep sadness betraying his face.
Berating himself, Was all this for naught?
A final sad message for his love Pepper Potts.

Nebula walked on by, a gentle touch on his shoulder;
She sensed something new — Tony’s will had grown bolder.
Not like this, Tony muttered, He’s not getting me too.
And the duo arrived to Avengers HQ.

The audience gasped, they clapped, and they cheered
For the OG Avenger was finally here!
The team now assembled, they needed a plan.
The audience knew: they needed Ant-Man.

Steve worried and worried; he tightened his jaw.
He thought of the plan — Was there any flaw?
Avenge the friends who had fallen: Bucky, Scarlet Witch.
Without hesitation, Let's go get this son of a bitch.

They hopped in their spaceship, Captain Marvel at helm
But poor Scott Lang — stuck in the quantum realm!
On their way to fight Thanos, they followed the stones;
Each hero was ready deep down in their bones.

The mad titan Thanos was waiting with glee,
And where did that bring you? Back to me.
No battle more important; never higher, the stakes.
Together they cried, Whatever it takes.

Their butts, they got kicked! An ass-whooping, if you will;
A Marvel nerd scoffed, They didn’t have Beta Ray Bill..
Back home they crawled, desperation at hand
When Scott Lang arrived in an old, beat-up van!

A time vortex! Scott cried, That’s how we can win!
We have to try, Widow added, no matter how slim.
A new strat was brewing: make the timelines anew.
You trust me? Tony asked. Cap nodded, I do.

They put on new suits, sleek black, white, and red.
Get the stones before Thanos — they’ll time skip instead!
You know your teams and your missions, Cap reassured all;
There’s no time to waste, no more chances to stall.

At this point, dear readers, I can’t guess the plot
But oh, it was glorious! Our heartstrings were taut.
No character safe, truly anything goes
Behind the masterminds of our dear Russo Bros.

But know this, my friends, the story was grand
And we would all witness our heroes’ last stand.
They fell again and again, but never surrendered;
The most beautiful movie a Marvel fan would remember.

With the purple guy bested, the Avengers had won.
Their friends were un-dusted, the fighting was done.
The audience wept, and the credits then rolled.
The saga was finished, the tale had been told.

Like an astral projection came All-Father Stan Lee
With a tear in his eye for all he could see.
His heroes were heroes; he could want nothing more.
Happy Endgame to all, and to all, Excelsior!",none,,2021-03-08 16:28:35.664730,0

Thanos is beheaded at very beginning, Thor went for the head. Then alternate dimension Thanos finds alternate Nebula and scans her memory banks and knows exactly what happens. Black Widow sacrifices herself while Hawkeye tries to stop her, allowing him to collect the soul stone. Gamora, Vision and Black Widow remain permanently dead. Thanos comes to Earth to seize the Stark gauntlet, almost gets it after destroying the Avengers headquarters. Just before Thanos gets it, beats the shit out of ALL the Avengers including Captain Marvel who he sends halfway around the planet in one punch. Thanos, clutching the gauntlet, but not yet wearing it, puts it on,  goes to snap his fingers, and in the ruckus doesn't realize Stark stole the stones out and put them on his right hand of the suit. Snap of the fingers. Sacrifices himself. Ironically, Thanos turns to dust, Tony's dead and when Cap. decides to be the one who takes the stones back in time to scatter throughout space and come right back in a matter of seconds, he decided to stay behind, and reappears as an 85 year old man and passes the shield to Sam.

The movie was garbage. Tons of plot holes that made no sense at all. Why did Thanos become more powerful without the stones than with? It completely undoes the plot of IW.

Iron Man and Widow death was stupid, but they are lame characters, so I’m not surprised. They only did this to try to win the critics over trying to make people feel something.

The humor was super corny.

Thank u so much for paying off the 10 years we had invested in ur franchise 

Im aware ur most likely goung to go in a racist and sexist direction in the future 
& i cant supporr any type of sexism or racism that is often proposed by the movements ur imvolved in 
So i cant see me being a part of ur future 
Although I will watch this space for what u do in the future, in hope it's done fairly

But whatever u end up doing 
I am grateful u pulled back a lot and allowed the pay off we deserved with this film

I wont lie
I always pay my way
Go cinema or wait for a DVD release
But I have streamed this film, yes illegally!
I dont endure that at all
But I had to kmow what i was paying to support
I will now be going cinema & paying fairly to u
Now i know the movie isnt pushing a political agender
And isn't forcing an idea that women are stronger than men or men are stronger than women
Or black or white agenders

I felt the women were strong in this film 
The men were strong
Both sex's had strengths and weaknesses 

U hope u decide against bre or u at least demand she doesnt use ur platform for hate towards any1 anymore 
If she does that as her personal project thats up to her but i hope u dont allow it for ur movies 
If u do...
I am out, but i will not be slagging it off anymore
I will instead be ignoring it and walking away
Because i am grateful u gave us this ending to our 10 years of investment 

I wpuld be outraged if u jad denighed us this 

White male, white female
Black male, black female
There is no reason to make a big deal of us 
Single any1 out for better or for worse
Just allow growth to happen naturally 
Teach poor societies that harf work gives positive results 
Not hate for colour or a different sex 
Base reward on a persons achievements 
On their choices 
Not like bre has done with the platform u gave her
Hate on any1 who works hard is wrong and u know it is

Thank u anyway

After Thanos uses the Infinity Stones, Clint Barton's family are turned to dust, along with half of all living creatures in the universe. Nebula and Tony Stark are stranded in space following their defeat by Thanos, but are returned to Earth by Carol Danvers and reunited with the surviving Avengers. The team formulate a plan to steal the Infinity Stones back from Thanos and use them to reverse his actions, but learn upon finding him that he had used the stones a second time to destroy them, preventing their further use. In anger, Thor kills Thanos.

Five years later, Scott Lang escapes from the quantum realm to discover that five years had passed, and that Hope van Dyne, along with half of the population, had disappeared. Lang goes to Black Widow and Captain America, and explain that while five years had passed, only five hours had passed for him in the quantum realm. The three go to Stark, who is now raising a child with Pepper Potts, and explain their theory that the quantum realm can be used to go back in time and steal the Infinity Stones before Thanos is able to collect them. Stark initially rejects their proposal with concern about risking parenthood, but after reflecting upon the loss of Peter Parker decides to test computer models for quantum time travel. He succeeds in finding a model that works, and is further encouraged by Potts to act after having further doubts.

The Avengers are reunited with a plan – Banner, Captain America, Lang, and Stark embark to retrieve the Time, Mind, and Space stones from New York during the Avengers' battle with Loki in 2012. Banner goes to the Sanctum Sanctorum, where he is informed by the Ancient One that taking the Time Stone from her timeline would prevent Doctor Strange's future efforts to stop Kaecilius from destroying the laws of nature. She concedes the Time Stone to Banner however, after he informs her that Strange had given Thanos the stone in his timeline, implying Strange had intended for a specific sequence of events to occur for Thanos to be defeated, including Banner taking possession of the Time Stone. Banner also promises the stones' return to her timeline in order to prevent any ill effects. Lang and Stark attempt to steal the Space Stone – Lang gives Stark's past self a cardiac arrest by pulling a circuit in his artificial heart and causing a scene, while Stark steals the briefcase when nobody is looking. Their plan is thwarted as Stark drops the briefcase after he is accidentally hit by the Hulk. Loki then uses the Space Stone to escape custody. Captain America succeeds in stealing the Mind Stone from undercover Hydra agents, but stumbles across and fights his past self, whom mistakes him for a disguised Loki. Lang returns to the present while Captain America and Stark devise a plan to steal the Space Stone from a U.S. Army installation in the 1950s, while stealing further vials of fluid in order to make the journey back home. While there, Captain America sights Peggy Carter and Stark converses with his father Howard before returning.

Rocket and Thor travel to Asgard to retrieve the Reality Stone before Malekith uses it against the nine realms. While in Asgrad, Thor is reminded that his mother, Frigga, would die soon and has a chance encounter with her while Rocket steals the Reality Stone from Jane Foster. The two return to Earth after Frigga counsels Thor and he retrieves his hammer. Nebula and War Machine travel to Xandar to steal the Power Stone before Peter Quill does. As War Machine returns to the present with the Power Stone, Nebula malfunctions and remains on Xandar. Her memories are accidentally transferred to her past self, which Thanos uses to learn that he would ultimately succeed in his plans to wipe out half the universe and that the Avengers are going back in time to retrieve the Stones before he does. Barton and Black Widow travel to Vormir to retrieve the Soul Stone, though are conflicted when Red Skull, keeper of the Soul Stone, informs them that the stone can only be retrieved by sacrificing someone they love. The two fight over who would make the sacrifice, and Black Widow ultimately takes the fall, with Barton taking the Soul Stone back to Earth and informing the other Avengers of Black Widow's death.

After Nebula is captured by Thanos and her time travel abilities given to her more loyal past self, the past Nebula uses Banner's time machine to transport Thanos and his army to the Avengers' base. The Avengers task Banner to use the Infinity Stones to bring everybody killed by Thanos back. He succeeds, though they are attacked by Thanos, who reduce the base to rubble. The past Nebula is killed by her future self as she attempts to take the Infinity Stones from Hawkeye, while Captain America, Thor, and Stark confront Thanos, who decides to instead use the Infinity Stones to destroy the universe and create one in his vision. Soon after Thanos' army lands on Earth, T'Challa appears before Captain America, along with all of the Avengers revived by Banner, before launching an assault on Thanos and his army. After a lengthy battle during which Stark is reunited with Parker and Gamora is reunited with Quill, Thanos wrestles with numerous Avengers for the Infinity Stones. Risking certain death, Stark rips the Infinity Stones from Thanos' hand and uses them to turn Thanos and his entire army into dust. Parker and Potts console Stark as he dies from the radiation emitted from the Stones.

Following the battle, the Avengers hold a funeral for Stark, whose artificial heart is floated into the sea. Thor makes Valkyrie the Queen of Asgard and joins the Guardians of the Galaxy. Meanwhile, Captain America is tasked to go into the past to return the stones and Thor's hammer to their original timelines, but decides not to return to the present and to instead live the rest of his life in the past with Carter. As an older man, he appears before Falcon and gives his shield to him.

I liked it although the pacing was a bit off-putting at times. The first half could have been shortened especially with the Hawkeye stuff.
I didn't really like the development of Hulk and Thor. The flashbacks were nice, especially the interaction between Tony and his dad. The battle was of course gigantic and the characters get a nice send-off, I liked Cap's choice.
For me this movie has concluded the MCU as the upcoming projects do not interest me that much.

Now there's a big difference in movies that were made previous to the sjw garbage. There's a reason why a lot of people are not going to the movies it's because we want to see a movie without having political narrative is thrown in our face. There is both men and women on this planet not just women and if you make movies for only one portion of the population and the rest get thrown to the side of course we have a reason to be pissed off. I mean when you look in the mirror what do you see are you a man or are you a woman the simple question. Do you always want to see a movie where you're considered a toxic male. Eventually all this crap is going to come to a head and someone's going to probably end up losing their lives there's already been one life lost to this crap Anthony Bourdain has the woman that he fell in love with he found out had sexual relations with a 14 year old boy.,none,,2021-03-08 16:28:37.079083,0

Because there are patetic sad people out there that finds joy in ruening the experience for others. These people sadly exist and eat our food and breath our air and drink our water. It's sad... But it's a fact. Trust no one... I will not be going to the premiere. I never do as it honestly isn't a good experience for me. So i'll have to wait a couple days maybe. And while i do i will not trust anyone. Not even the dude at the store. I will be listening to music anywhere i go all the time until i sit my ass down in the movie theater and the film begins playing.

There were tears in my eyes multiple times and I think a lot of the characters got the ending they deserved. I would give it an 8.5 out of 10. I do however have a few major gripes with it SPOILERS:

-I feel like they ruined Thor’s character... I get that he’s always had a sense of humor since ragnorok, but really? He’s such a slob now it’s ridiculous. I so badly wanted to see prime Stormbreaker Thor fight Thanos, but all we got was the out of shape drunken one.
-Social justice is everywhere, including a bit in Endgame. The movie had a great example of how to do a female empowering scene and how not to do one. The cringey captain marvel scene taking the gauntlet with all her lady helpers was trying way too hard, but they made up for it with the passing of Asguardians ruler to Valkyrie. I was so proud. 
-Captain Marvel was more likeable in this movie, but she’s still ridiculously overpowered, and was basically just a cop out in the final battle. Her superpower is to just fly through everything lol. 
-How THE FUCK did tony use the gauntlet (even if just for a few seconds) if Hulk just barely survived using it? Canonically it doesn’t make any sense, although the scene itself was absolutely incredible.
-Speaking of Hulk, if feel like if IW was emasculating for him, Endgame was even worse. His character is now a nerd in a handicapped brutes body. The professor Hulk thing didn’t work for me, they should have saved that for its own movie or something. 
Other than that, it was amazing. You get a lot of throwback and references at the end that give you a sense of how far you’ve come with these characters, and it brought tears to my eyes. Thank you, Marvel, for the wonderful journey.",none,,2021-03-08 16:28:37.812435,0

The remaining avengers meet with Tony. They want to take revenge from thanos. They find his location but tony does not want any of this. So rest ot avengers go to the Garden.
Thanos' hand is damaged. He snapped the gauntlet again to destroy the stones. Thor cuts of his head. The avengers return to earth.

5 Years later.
Tony has a daughter and is living his life. All other avengers are living in depression as although they killed thanos they could not bring the dusted back.

A mouse presses the button and Antman comes out of the quantum realm. He finds what happened during his absence of 5mins. Goes to meet avengers and suggests theory of time travel.

Captain, black widow and Scott go to Tony to propose this idea. He doesn't want any part of it.

Then they decide to go to the second most intelligent avenger they know. Professor Hulk.

And i know that alot of people won't care because the last 20-30mins of the movie was so memorable and exciting.  But when you look back to it you'll realized you just paid 200 pesos inside the cinema watching an old steven Spielberg movie for like 1hr and a half and then avengers for like 20-30mins. But hey,maybe its just me. To be honest the infinity war was even better because it was more action packed.

He was there at the beginning, He was there at the end. and if you think the Captain Marvel movie was women empowerment, fellow geeks, you have no idea what Avengers Endgame is gonna show. The women! The Women! The whole marvel universe women!!! are gonna steal some glory for only a few moments BUT the moment was GLORIOUS!!! Even thor's coming in wakanda in Infinity War never comes close to it! and YES!!!! Captain America Wields a weapon he previously thought himself unworthy to bear(wink, wink!).

I saw the film this morning at a 03:30 IMAX screening.  After sitting through at least 6 trailers (eternity), it felt like the film would never start.  When it did, the cinema f*cked up by playing the 3D version instead and had to restart with the correct 2D showing... We were initially annoyed but cheered when the showing stopped before getting too far in. 
 
**Giant sigh**

HOWEVER, when the film began to roll it was plain sailing.  People may have an issue with the initial pace that starts slow, however I'd liken it Breaking Bad - ie slow but necessary to really flesh out the world and characters after the events of the snap.  Personally I found the world / character building to be one of the stronger elements of the film, which made the whole thing feel plausible, satisfying and entertaining.  

For those worried about CAPTAIN MARVEL, I fully TRUSTED the Russo brothers ability to *direct* actors and was SATISFIED with how they utilised her...

I've been sceptical on reports about people crying multiple times throughout.  I hate to add to the cliché but I found myself GENUINELY welling up on multiple occasions.  The stakes truly felt real and there was a balanced mix of emotions...

I had a few gripes on certain technical aspects that made me raise an eyebrow... that said, the few bits that didn't work in that respect were, in my opinion, completely overshadowed by all the working elements of the film. 

CONCLUSION, if you do see it theatrically, watch it in IMAX.  Where INFINITY WAR felt a little rushed and borederline lacklustre (thinking of the Battle for Wakanda mainly) - this was the quickest 3 hours I'd ever sat through and I was left wanting MORE by the end...",none,,2021-03-08 16:28:40.011604,0

Without spoiling anything, the light breeze of representation that Grace is applauding Marvel for is a comics accurate haircut....not a moment between two characters. Not a subtle but ""distinct"" indication. Not even a throwaway nugget of dialogue that the LGBT community is forced to cling on to under the guise of diversity.

The laughs, the clapping, the wailing... It took me out of the movie couple times. There were some moments of pure fan service - but, the irony: the fans in my screening robbed me of the satisfaction I should get from fan service. 
Almost every movie has plotholes - but when you enjoy the movie, even when plotholes are important, you don't think about them as much. This movie established some rules, just to break them. Structure of this movie raises issues with overall MCU continuity. Inconsistency of power/endurance of characters detracted from enjoyment of this movie as well.
Remember when people were upset about how the Luke Skywalker character didn't match their expectations in Last Jedi? Yup, this kind of can of worms is open all over again in Endgame.
I liked some character arcs, I liked how some of them were wrapped up - but I don't want to say anything more because it'd be huge spoilers. However, there was one particular interaction after main story got resolved that weirdly mirrored a scene from infinity war, and I felt like they missed an opportunity there.
This movie relies on the context of the rest of MCU to be appreciated to the full extent, with emphasis on Infinity War; and it relies on some spoilers.
All things considered, in my opinion Endgame is weaker than Infinity War - but I would pin it above Civil War. I recommend watching this movie - but also, I'd suggest not to inflate your expectations.",none,,2021-03-08 16:28:40.236182,0

I watch them the very next day at a  morning screening, ensuring no spoilers, no packed screening, without having to watch it at midnight (unapealing). But my buddy isn't a morning person and were going to see it at 3.45, not only will there be kids but its at a cinema ive nev3r been to before so i could have a horrible experience. The thought of having a bad cinema exp with endgame horrified me so I've decided to go to my trusted cinema, in the morning, watch it by myself in peace and then join my buddy's to watch it with them in the afternoon. just 12 hours to go and I'm so so so excited. and i get to see it twice in one day. whooo",none,,2021-03-08 16:28:40.437894,0

Battle choreography is still lackluster in hollywood, both at micro and the macro level, any future film with serious choreography just will eat END GAME alive like a Thanos' finger snap.

Hearing that Marvel are pushing LGBT even by just a hint, makes me sad and mad and to not want to see their movies going forward.
Why push LGBT in Marvel Disney films which are aimed towards children and families? Why even hint it? It's not needed. 
DC have been pushing LGBT in their series and films and how's that worked out for them? It is partly the reason why they are not doing so well.
Children need to be allowed to grow up and just be children without brainwashing them into accepting such things. Society is not better for it, it's getting worse with it's ""anything goes"" inclusive of all things global agenda. SJW's are already pushing for representation of paedophilia. The downfall of western society is inevitable and academic analysts of culture, history and society are saying so.

*sigh*

One thing I can agree with Thanos on: Reality really IS disappointing. Even relationships between fictional characters never go the way I wish they would. I was hoping that SOMETHING like Stucky would happen in this film, but of course it just couldn’t be. Speaking from personal experience, every other LGBT couple in a film or television series is forced, or out in last minute with no development, and oftentimes used for pandering. Relationships that actually could work and be something more never happen. It just upsets me.

I’ll forgive Marvel, as what I’m hearing so far is that this movie is great nonetheless. Haha

Think about. You travel in time to change an event that has already happened. So Thanos has won.

Also, if they (The Avengers) can time travel to change the past, than so can almost anyone in in MCU universe or multiverse, so Thanos can just try again and not make the same mistake twice. This can, and has, if you think about it, can go on forever. I want see the movie, but this time travel thing have me scratching my head. I just can't get around the cyclical nature nature of it all.
I think Infinity War will be a bit better movie than Endgame because of the story ark of time travel. Why not just kill Thanos as a baby and get it over with. Sort of like the ""kill Hitler as baby theory."", same principle.

There is only a handful. However, for me, 2049 was an easy A+. I am still dismayed why it did not win the oscar. I thought it was a masterpiece and immediately had to own it. And, yes, visually, it is beyond stunning. The cinematography is SO good it really does leave your mouth gaping and you bewildered at how they even made it. The lightly, the sets, world-building. Two other movies only come to mind at this level of visuals, Alita and Valerian. Alita mostly holds up and I feel is underrated, but I agree with all the criticisms thrown at Valerian, however much I'm usually reluctant to pull movies apart. Sadly, Valerian could have worked with a few different choices. However, 2049 is far more than just the visuals. It is SO well-plotted, written, acted, and the pacing for me was perfect for this type of movie. A+ any day of the week.",none,,2021-03-08 16:19:42.115752,0

Yes I realize I might have missed things. However I have watched several videos about it, hoping to find something to love about this film (because the original is one of my all-time favorites and it would be great if I loved this one too). The reason it's boring is that it doesn't connect with me emotionally. I didn't care about any of the characters. K's search to be special was petty. Wright's character made dumb mistakes that made her hard to believe. Deckard was great. He had the best dialogue and two hours of back story from 1982. Yes, the shots were beautiful. They were also dead. Yes, the production design was cool. That's not nearly enough though. How about the subject matter? Nothing new there either, plus poorly handled. Example: the DNA/binary comparison. Completely uninteresting and condescendingly communicated. On top of that, the soundtrack is nothing special, despite having one of the greatest OSTs ever to draw inspiration from.  Overall, a pretty picture and with that a huge disappointment. Would have been better to just let Blade Runner be. But hey. What else is new.

One more thing that was bugging me throughout. Please tell me how I'm wrong here. In the original, we learn that memories can be implants. We also know those implants can come from another person (Tyrell's niece). Then why does K's entire arc hinge upon his memory being 'real' or not? It never mattered if it was real. Only if it was original. For which he never found any proof or even hint. It made the movie so damn frustrating that he didn't see that. Is he indeed an idiot of a character, or am I the idiot, missing something and speaking overly confidently?",none,,2021-03-08 16:19:42.116177,6

Its not a bad movie, but theirs some things that fall weak to me.  The Cinematography is OK,  yes OK, i do love Roger is not afraid to use the full scope of gamma range, not afraid to use blacks to the point of loosing detail.  That things can lost within the shadows.  I love it!,  cant stand modern studio lighting where everything is seen, everything is lit, and it all looking as if shot in a cheap small studio. The music/score is also good. Not vangelis great but good. Theirs certainly times when its just.. mMWwah!!!  perfect! but others when you think , this is just sounds and not music. There are HUGE plot holes, like.. After police chief is killed by luv, No one goes after officer K? when its made so clear, the scrutity society has placed on Replicants is very constrained.  after all its K who's been dealing with the Chief and who's still going about in his Police car? after failing his baseline test.   Yes we know that Wallace has eyes everywhere but he doesn have absolute power and would certainly want to catch Officer K.  As for Luv, Not following Wallace orders to find the child herself and instead using K to do her work for her wouldve been noticed by Wallace.  To me the movie is good not great,  the sum is geater than its parts.  I couldnt stand the terrible lighting for the police chief office.  my god what did they usual floresent bulbs.  obviously that was intended but how jarringly bad.  and some of that comp work in those scenes led much to be desired.  even K's Apt didnt have the best lighting in the world. certainly not in comparison to the original blade runner and deckards apartment.   or for that matter the chief Bryants office.    2049 isnt a bad film , and it maintains a level of noir,  which is good,  but its no tour de force of what the original film was.  But i guess much of what 2049 is to be viewed from the standpoint of a society lacking humanity.  characters lacking a soul. and as such all we see and feel is the machine of it all.  The soundtrack more machine than orchestral., The lighting more cold and devoid of warmth , and the acting more dry and robotic.   i could not stand the uprising scene.  just a whole bunch of people hanging out in the sewers and no one learning of this?    but as mention i do enjoy 2049,  its a future unpredicted.  but far more bleak.  as it comes across that mankind and earth is on its last leg.",none,,2021-03-08 16:19:42.422620,0

Yes, the cinematography is awesome. The soundtrack and audio in general... want to be too much. The plot holes in the movie are gigantic, too. A lot of it just doesn't make any sense at all. So the replicants Deckard and Rachel hat a child -- one they had to abandon, that was actually growing up in the realm of a slaver. How exactly did she made from the bottom of that pit it to that high-end job that she has when they find her later in the movie? Yeah. We'll never know. There are interesting aspects to this movie; a replicant forming a deep and serious love relationship to a simulated spouse,  Joi. Only to realize later that, well, she was just a program. That is tragic and you feel seriously sorry for 'K'. But then the movie somehow kills it by depicting everybody else in the film as cruel, despicable beings. Ultimately, it just falls short of the original movie that raised the very same questions, but actually made you CARE. I am sorry, but this movie is a shallow but beautifully photographed mess.  It does not live up to the original, it does not play in the same league. It looks great, it sounds obnoxious, it lacks the depth and leaves you with a lot of unanswered questions.

Film failed at the Box Office.  That alone is very telling.  It was very long and very boring to watch.  Hitchcock was right in saying astutely that ""The length of a film should be directly related to the endurance of the Human Bladder"".  Could have benefited with some strategic and quicker cuts. Pedestrian storyline was very predictable to most science fiction fans.  I was there with a full VIP audience the night before the World wide premiere. We were all fans of the Original Blade Runner and were hoping to be blown away by the sequel.  No applause at the end.  Audience left very disappointed.  I think it simply missed the mark compared to the 1982 Masterpiece.  Also. don't agree on Denis being one of the best Directors around. The brilliant James Cameron, if given the opportunity. would have made this sequel an action packed masterpiece that would have blown the lid off at the box office too.  His sequel to Alien, ""Aliens"", many agree, is better than Ridley's original.  He knows how to cut a film better than many Directors today.  You were right at the end of your review Chris.

He was smart to cast insanely attractive women in it (that kinda new age super cute, but not necessarily beautiful thing movies do now).  The music also, was simply a modern upgrade to the original music.  Even some of the sound effects were the same as the original, however the gun shots were less bombastic than in the first one which made it worse.  I don't mind long movies, or ""thinkers"", but this just seemed unnecessarily dragged out.  The plot is actually kinda thin if you ask me.  From the moment he meets the woman who makes memories I was like, ok, she's the Daughter (I mean it didn't take a genius, they stated she had an auto immune issue), then it was just a matter of finding Deckard and getting him to her.  It did do something few movies actually do now, which is get better as it went on.  I'll give it credit for that.  The first BR had many memorable scenes that are still quoted and thought of to this day (Remember the scathing review it got from Siskel and Ebert, idiots).  I can't think of any that will stand the test of time in this movie.  I don't know...maybe I'll watch it again under better settings but to me the movie was ok, not a classic or masterpiece by a long shot.  Theres just nothing we haven't seen before in Sci-fi.  The scrap metal area where flying garbage trucks dump loads of scrap and people on the fringes of society living there barely surviving.  Gee, how many Sci-Fi movies have we seen that in?  Then the skipping scenes where Joi's hologram was skipping.  People, we saw that in a Eurythmics video in the mid 1980s.  Stop getting gaga over it.",none,,2021-03-08 16:19:42.639087,1

But I found a few problems with the movie that for me just ruined it. I've been working with computers closely for the past few months and I've become intimate with them, actually I've been close with computers since I was 9-11 years old (no joke intended) so it broke my heart to discover the flaws I did.

For example:

In the original movie I where Deckard is investigating a photo by zooming in and enhancing the photograph and then artificially moving the camera in 3D space was completely unrealistic though fortunately that's the only time the technology in that movie done this.

Next I'd like to highlight what worked.

In the original a lot of the computer systems were terminal/command line based which does a wonderful job at cementing everything we see in a real setting, we know computers like this, we interact with them like this, it's familiarity in a fantasy land, this was also one of the reasons Her worked so well, we saw the technology that we're used to, that we use in a daily basis, and we understand being used in new and creative ways.

That's not what we see in this movie.

All the technology in this movie looks like it's straight out of a Video Game HUD, this level of fantasy technology completely breaks the world they're presenting and makes almost every depiction of technology in this movie feel cheap and hardly thought of. For an overpopulated planet where technology should feel to be used scarcely it feels wrong to have a car that feels like it has a 2080 Ti in it. 

That was a constant reminder throughout the entire movie.

Another scene they're using a microscope to inspect the remains of a skeleton which the head of the microscope not only fails to follow the commands that the characters are giving but the footage received from the microscope is played back as if it were a handheld camera which is completely unrepresentative of how technology like this actually functions.

Replicants in the first movie are known to be near carbon copies of humans with no telling features (outside of a psychological test and the reflection of their eyes) but in this movie there's just straight up a barcode on the lower portion of the eye, not only stylistically different (and potentially inferior to the original) but makes no sense in regards to the original movie since we know that the first movie takes place in Nov 2019 and this Replicant was manufactured sometime in 2020, now, this doesn't necessarily break the lore as we could just say this new implementation developed between then but it's just another detail that doesn't quite fit.

Next there's the scene with a hologram where it's revealed that a bright light will make the effect opaque and see-through but between two cuts the lighting of the scene and the opaqueness of the hologram is jarringly different.

There's a few others but the common person, let alone film buff would hardly care about details such as this but for me it's like watching a Matrix sequel/reboot and when the boot into the Matrix you see a Windows 10 logo appear with a nice GUI, icons, taskbar and all.",none,,2021-03-08 16:19:42.829086,0

So when a movie like this comes out so many people thinks its dumb cause it doesnt have balls to the walls action or cause its not spoon fed to the audience.

Anytime those negative feelings or thoughts ran through my mind, Blade Runner was the only thing that helped. It transported me to another world where I was able to let everything go. When 2049 was announced I was extremely excited. Mainly because of who was directing. If anybody besides Ridley Scott was going to direct it I was astounded that it was Mr. Denis. But unfortunately I was never able to make it to theaters to see it. But I pre-ordered it and as soon as it came out I had a plan. I had ordered one of Johnnie Walkers collectable Blade Runner bottles they'd designed for the film. So on the day I received 2049, my best friend and I moved our TV to the garage with our surround sound. Got an ash tray, 2 packs of cigarettes and 2 glasses with the Johnnie Walker. He had never seen the first film. So we indulged ourselves by watching both films back to back while enjoying the delicious scotch whiskey and having our cigarettes. And after almost 6 hours we never got up from our seats. And decided 2049, aside from the original being the classic it is, actually succeeded (in our opinions) in being a superior film...and rewatched it. I am currently watching this film right now with my girl friend and he jaw dropped 5 minutes in and it's still open. Blade Runner can truly save and change lives. Also, what a fantastic review.

3:33 ""This is not trying to be a setup to a brand new franchise of movies."" It absolutely is, as the ending is too open-ended. ***ATTENTION - SPOILERS AHEAD*** 1. We don't see Wallace again and his story arc is not finished. The movie spends a lot of time painting him as a ruthless, calculating and powerful character that the audience should hate and yearn for his fall from power, but he then disappears in the final act and is completely forgotten, which just feels odd. 2. The movie clearly ends on the big cliffhanger of Deckard finally meeting his daughter. And of course the viewers want to see the resolution of this milestone in terms of character and story development. The director even emphasises the carrot-on-a-stick feeling by making Deckard put his hand on the glass, trying to reach for his daughter, yet we don't even see her reaction, only his smile -- and the movie cuts, followed by the credits roll. Textbook cliffhanger. 3. An upcoming underground revolution is not even hinted at, but even openly spoken about, centered around Deckard's daughter. 4. Ryan Gosling again pulls that stunt of playing dead like he did at the end of driver, with the difference that it is not 100% resolved here, so the viewers don't really know if Joe is dead or not. 5. From where the movie leaves the story, Deckard's daughter will still be in danger from Wallace. We don't see Deckard hiding her (which is almost impossible, considering her health condition), nor Wallace break off his hunt for her. All Wallace knows at the movie's end is that the car crashed and everybody inside died.",none,,2021-03-08 16:19:43.252137,2

Blade Runner 2049 felt more like a movie showing what a movie should be.  It was as if Denis Villeneuve had these gorgeous concepts he wanted to place together but, in doing so, he forgets to add flesh and blood to make the story come off the storyboard and become something that is alive and breathing.

Why are so many movies that peddle nihilism considered as profound or masterpieces today. Have people lost minds? Oh, I know, these new movies are considered profound because of slow pacing, convoluted ideas that actually contradict each other once you go deeper, decadence and self medication through gratification as a stand in for love, the oppressed having a revolution against the tyranny of the oppressors, and best of all, the movie ends right before that revolution kills millions, or in this movie's case, billions of people. This movie sells the decadence and morality of revolution, but doesn't tell the audience the price.
2049 is the complete antithesis of the original. The original's lead replicant, realized how precious life was in the end, and he saves Harrison Ford's character's life despite him being his enemy and dies while relishing the feeling of every drop of rain on his face. Harrison Ford's character falls in love with one of the very things he previously hunted and despised, drops his own life, and goes on the run with her. It was a beautiful lily fighting the inevitable and growing in the middle of the chaotic muck.
2049 is the complete opposite despite the window dressing of the Gosling character's noble actions. In 2049, the one eyed leader of the resistance says ""Dying is the most human thing we can do"". At face value, that may seem like a well meaning statement. But dying for what? Dying for the human replicant hybrid? Dying for her resistance? Dying so that the resistance can kill billions of humans and replace their species now that they have the miracle of live birth? The huge naked Joi with the dead eyes is the true face of 2049. Decadence becomes nihilism, becomes death. That is the true 3rd act of 2049. I guess nihilism is harder to sell once the slaughter is included in the movie.

ESB is an A+ film. The Godfather is an A+ film.

Arrival was average
2049 is a B minus movie - an uncompelling narrative, and plot holes weigh it down. 
The original BR had D.A.D.E.Sheep guiding it, but this one does not have that luxury - and it shows.  
And it looks like they're setting us up for a new film, and possibly another trilogy. A replicant uprising I bet. And an all-out war. Snooze

The cinematography was absolutely beautiful and the world felt completely well realised and believable. However the pacing was eye-gougingly slow. You could  get up from your seat and go for a piss and they'd still be having a dramatic pause between dialogue when you got back. Once you notice you can't not notice, and every single time it feels so self important, like you're supposed to think what was just said was profound when it really, really wasn't. The plot becomes predictable, though still engaging. The chain of evidence he follows all seems ridiculously convenient in how well it leads to the next thing and how easily it can be uncovered (but it's movie logic and I can suspend my disbelief). 

I know I'll be called a feminazi or whatever but the way women are portrayed just really rubbed me up the wrong way and made me uncomfortable. And usually I swear I'm fine, it was just so detached from them as characters, they were all possessions or sexual objects there naturally to be attracted to generic relatable average Joe. I get it's a future society and maybe a shitty view of women is worsened by technology and rampant consumerism. But the only lead female character to not be in some form of slavery, prostitution or in a glass cage, dies of course and is barely in it. Yaaaay. Not to mention ""let's just throw in some stone titties here and there in the desert or a giant nude hologram or let's graphically slice this woman's belly open and let blood run down her naked body or say that what differentiates real women from not -real women is whether they can have children or not, etc, etc."" I just feel like all that needs some balancing, some lead female characters who stick around and disagree with the world around them. Idk. It's just not pleasant to watch as a woman. 

I did like the ending, Kay had a beautiful story arc, but overall came out feeling kind of 'meh'.  Stunning cinematography, decent and engaging story, liked the lead character.

For a 2 hour and 43 minutes film that was for me to long to keep my interrest.
I understand the message about loneliness and acceptance.
But does it really need it to be this long? I mean after 30 min. you'll get the point.
Tip: First watch the first Blade Runner before watching this.
There are a lot of references to the old movie. If you haven't seen the first one you might not understand what the are talking about.
So here are my likes and dislikes:

*Likes* 
- Ryan Gosling was very good.
- The visuals were perfect.
- Soundtrack was good.
- For a Sci-Fi Mystery Drama overall it's good.
- Liked Lt. Joshi (Robin Wright) and Luv (Sylvia Hoeks) characters.
- Story itself was good but if it made it shorter then it would be perfect.
- JOI (Ana de Armas) was oke. 

*Dislikes*
- I hated the daughter of Deckard.
- Niander Wallace (Jared Leto) was a vague character and speak like some weird priest (irritating).
What was really his purpose for finding the daughter or overall in this film?
What is his background?
- Plus he reminded me of the character "" The Illusive Man"" of Mass Effect series (game).
I think they were inspired ( or stole) that character.
- The (soft) sex scene was stupid and not necessary, because as a viewer you already know ""K"" wants to feel love.
- The rebels were dumb and useless.
- And no, this wasn't Harrison Ford's best performance.
Nothing special about it.
- Slow pace is good at some point but this was to slow (drag).
I have seen films as long as 2.1/2 hours or even longer with a slow pace.
And they didn't feel dragged, because they were used efficiently to tell and develop the story.

I'll give it an 8/10.
Maybe if i was a real optimist an 8.5. :)
I prefer the old Blade Runner more, despite his own flaws.",none,,2021-03-08 16:19:43.467072,0

Since you don`t actually get deep into the plot and directing of the movie here,
I was wondering, since the movie recently got released on DVD and what not, if you could make either a Spoiler filled review or perhaps even an analyzing one?

Blade Runner 2049, for the mature of all ages, is immersive, moving and stunning both visually and aurally and indeed it stands on its own, albeit the impetus for me was the original Blade Runner, making it the perfect sequel - as well. Purchased the movie in 3d to match my theatre viewing experience...and on my fifth home viewing....still incredible! The speculative, marketing inspired demise of 3d in North America is undoubtedly and assuredly premature. 3d format or otherwise the movie remains a masterpiece. 

It should be the Oscar pick for best movie of 2017, and the cast including Ryan Gosling, Harrison Ford, Ana de Armas and others nominated in respective roles. Consummate actors all, not to mention Denis Villeneuve as Best Director. Thank Ridley Scott for recognizing his genius.

The reality is that Science Fiction, even as a statement on the human condition, has never won an Oscar for Best Movie, as far as I know. The Academy Awards will likely miss this, caught up in the social media swamp and the cause of the day. The Academy will likely instead vote for an odd duck or more common place take on the triumphs and tribulations of the human condition, all destined to become mediocrities and also rans for 2017. This in turn, as it continues to demonstrate, makes Oscar night nothing more than a gossips’ social gathering and more redundant and meaningless than ever in what it’s function should be - rewarding real achievement in film.

Meanwhile like the first Blade Runner, Blade Runner 2049 will continue to attract an ever growing following and challenge current and future movie makers to raise the bar on what is now possible.",none,,2021-03-08 16:19:43.699396,4

There are many problems plaguing movies of today and this movie also. Boring/unnatural/uninspired dialogue that could have been dealt with in a more efficient manner. Too much CGI (yes again), weak philosophical discourse, and too long of a movie (could have been 1h 45mins). Why would Replicants be hung up on natural reproduction holding them back in society? The thought that they would later be able to (maybe) be legally equal to man, built on one natural birth, is not much to hold onto. At the same time, they didn't seem very organized in documenting the details of the birth or the particulars. So man would just yield power to a spontaneous assembly of robots based on that argument? Aha. Good luck. There is an infinite possibility of scenarios of change, many that would be more efficient than the film plot. I deem it highly unlikely advanced robots would assemble and act like that, if simulating more outcomes. Setting a political agenda has little to do with logical arguments and a lot to do with shaping futures. The victor writes the narrative and history is often illogical (it's based upon an inherent logic). Only in fiction the narrative makes sense. Also, could the Jared Leto character talk more crap? He belongs up on there on the shelf with Yoda. Many more problems, but little time. Technical wizardry attempted but not very compelling from any angle.

First one I can honestly say was a bit of a bore, but seeing scenes back from it, I thought it was a speculator movie. I only saw 2049 only because of your recommendation to see it in theatres. I was sceptical at first hearing when it was going to come out, but once I saw this review for the movie, it was something i had to go experience myself. BladeRunner 2049 is one of my favourite movies ever now after watching it twice in theatres. I thought I comment talking about my experience, because I really respect your perspective on upcoming films.

These two movies are definitely a situation where a second viewing gives you a chance to understand it more and more.

But. This. Movie. Was. Just. Too. Slow.  And almost 3 hours of it!  Wonderful production design (but not as good as the original), cinematography, and a great performance by Ford.

But can I say that I enjoyed it?  No.   
It kept basically the same pace throughout the film...some decent combat scenes, but no ebb and flow, or no sense or urgency to enhance the imminent danger the characters are facing.

It is a truism that ""pretty pictures alone do not a good movie make""...This movie is the perfect example of that.

I could go on with an analysis, but I'll just say it was one of the most disappointing cinematic experiences I've had in awhile.  I enjoyed Ghost in the Shell (a film that I do not understand the negativity towards) a great deal more.",none,,2021-03-08 16:19:43.909806,0

I just heard it was good and when the credits were rolling and everyone was just standing up and going on with their lives, I just stood there in my chair up until the very end of the credits because I was shocked by how powerfull this movie is.
Its everything I love, Retrowave, long 3 hours movie, really good plot twists, amazing visuals, not a lot of action, etc...

Honnestly this might become my bew favorite movie ever, when I walked out of the cinema, I was still feeling weird about it but I knew I had the time of my life. At first I went with a girl to seduce her but I completly forgot about her when watching it, I honnestly didn't care about anything else.

It's a very confusing film for me (not the plot, I get that), I just can't decide what I think of the picture. The visuals and characters were fantastic. Also hats off to the director who made a sequel 30 or so years after the original and matched the tone of the film, seamlessly, to the first one; something hard to do when the original had such a distinctive style. Downsides, there were a few issues. What happened to Leto's character and Is he and old replicant or just blind?!?. Also after such a moody film (I have no issue with its tone by the way) was kinda hoping for a slightly more fulfilling ending for Gosling's character. Over all I did enjoy the film yes but an extra 10 minutes of addition to the story wouldn't have gone amiss. Also, it's not a film for everyone, I get that, but if you went in expecting Xander Cage vs Mega Shark with continuous gun fire; go and watch Transformers.",none,,2021-03-08 16:19:43.910595,0

This movie takes aspects of all the directors films and places them in a totally different aspect and universe. Unfortunately this film does not have mass appeal. However, it is a brilliant movie that the masses should appreciate.

I just saw this movie. For the life of me I cannot comprehend the fandom behind this or the original film (and I'm a hard sci-fi literature, film buff who loved The Arrival.)  Besides the obviously SPECTACULAR visuals neither film has much inner content. The ""high-art cinema"" or ""intellectual masterpiece"" statements sound ridiculous to my ear. The original film has a 5 minute setup in a way of 5 rogue ""military grade"" replicants who've escaped and need to be put down by Deckard. Everything from that point forward is hours of beautiful imagery and... nothing much else. By the end of the film I didn't know who Deckard is, what drives me. He was a guest popping into each scene and going off without any character defining actions. To say that his romance with Rachel felt abrupt is a huge understatement. Lastly, the ""military grade"" Roy's actions at the end of the film are mind-bending and confusing. Why would a killing machine get undressed, blast holes in the walls with his head, read an emotonal passage I, as an audience, have no emotional investment in and DIE?? Please someone enlighten me. What am I missing here? I love my visual storytelling with minimal spoon-feeding. But the original film or it's sequel (which had marginally more plot) hardly qualify as intellectual films.",none,,2021-03-08 16:19:44.130380,0

The visuals look good but that doesn't make a scene intresting
The story wasn't special, I've seen it many times and i saw the ""twist"" coming
It was way too long and it started dragging and never stopped dragging
Also, a lot of stuff happens that left thinking that was kinda dumb.

Your love for this film and everyone else raving about it made me want to see it.  I just saw it today.  This movie was horrible!  I'm so shocked everyone liked it so much omg there were sooo many plotholes this movie didn't make any sense.  Rewatching this review just to try and figure out what you saw in this.  The cinematography was great, and thats all I really have to say about it that's positive.  I think nowadays film critics associate boring and dragged out with ""good"" or ""deep"" and introspective when it wasn't, unless I grossly missed everything.  To be fair I haven't seen the originals, so maybe if I did I'd have a better appreciation for this movie but in my opinion if you have to watch the prequel in order to get the sequel then its not a good enough movie to stand alone.",none,,2021-03-08 16:19:44.131314,0

It was less of a ""blade runner"" and more of a person finding out who he really is etc. Jared Leno is acting like this godly figure but it just doesn't feel what they're trying to convey through his character. 6.5/10.

My experience was that it reminded me of those old Bond films where we are introduced to gadgets and how they work (the whole Joi introduction i get but then more with Mariette and how did Joi miss Mariette putting tracker in coat), amazing and unbelievable coincidences (like being shot down within steps of the wooden toy horse for example, finding Deckard easily, first try in ruins of Vegas and then K shoots down Luv's bad boys on their way with Deckard...good thing he easily found them on those open hwys!!) I really liked Luv and especially her tears, one of the best femme fatales for sure but damn it she just kept following those Bond scripts and leaving K alive and not just once. We get good examples of how nasty Luv is culminating with her shooting Rachel drone in the face but not with K, leaves the bastard mortally wounded but not dead to attend to Deckard that she says she will enjoy. Just like the old Bond. Oh and K in the beginning where he casually deals with Sapper well, I saw Ryan Gosling not K and as well at the end with his nasty mortal wounds he still gets the job done with deadly Luv just like in 'Drive'. I am aware that Villeneuve plays a lot with coincidence in his films like Maestrom and Incendies however in Bladrunner it just read like a Bond film and not like the synchronicity that can be found in life.",none,,2021-03-08 16:19:44.386816,5

Only problem is I didn't go back to see it again and realized why. This film did not have a fraction of the spirit of the original, even though it had a lot more to it. Now that said, maybe a movie never can, but Empire Strikes Back was actually my fav of that series.  The reason? I had to think long and hard but the answer is simply 'fear'. There is no fear over what's about to happen next. The great fights Harrison had with other actors in the original. The great despair, the great love story with the great ending. There was nothing like it and maybe never will be. I was dying to see the sequel but it truly did lack that fear and need to try and survive element.  This second installment just seems like a fading away of the first story, not 'it's own film' as you say.

And thank you for not complaining about the film being too long (which I've heard from other reviewers). Yes, it is a long film; however, something that stuck with me was that, even during the ""slow"" moments, the plot was constantly moving forward. At no time did I find any scenes to be ""filler"". The action scenes were all relevant, and not there just for their own sake. They also felt grounded in reality, unlike the overwhelming majority of modern sci-fi, which demands you suspend all disbelief. I agree, it is not for everyone, and some people will not like 2049. For me personally, it is a masterpiece, worthy of its predecessor.

Acting was bland and terrible (I get that they're replicants, but even the ones in the original movie were way ""more human than human""). The main story was just so simple: guy fucked a robot that gave birth to a hybrid that needs to be found (it's really obvious who it is), yet still they managed to drag it out for 3 hours and add a lot of dumb side plots which eventually led nowhere just to confuse average moviegoers.

The movie in my opinion looked bad. The special effects and CGI couldn't be more annoying to watch. Also there was barely any music and some sound effects were added just for the sake of having sound effects, which weren't caused by anything in the film.

I really looked forward to seeing Harrison Ford, only to be disappointed that he appears 2 hours into the movie and all he does is get captured by the ""bad guys"" , get rescued by the new guy and see his child. They are the only 3 memorable things he does in this whole movie.

There was only 1 scene in this whole movie that I truly enjoyed. When the antagonist (don't remember his name because he was too unmemorable) makes a copy of Rachel but Deckard says ""Her eyes were green"" so the guy has the copy destroyed in front of Deckard.

In my opinion, this movie was a disgrace to the original Blade Runner and I don't consider the sequel to be cannon so it won't destroy my memories of the original.",none,,2021-03-08 16:19:44.613149,0

I think someone older and ""odder"" would've been better in the role (the initial choice of David Bowie comes to mind). Plus the film was a little too on the nose in the way it introduced the guy and his agenda.

Anyhow: I also agree that you should see this film in the theater and on the largest screen in town. What you don't really need IMO is the 3D-version. It was ok, but overall not really necessary and I don't even think this movie needed the 3D-treatment in the first place. And no, I'm not generally hating 3D-movies if they're done well.

This movie was good but nowhere near a PERFECT movie. The plot was really subpar and Jared Leto's character was completely underutilized and poorly written. Not to mention there were a few scenes that felt like they didn't fit the movie at all and were thrown in for no reason, and didn't push the plot at all - like the fight in the junkyard? That scene was just thrown in for complete spectacle and didn't really add anything to the story.

Not to forget to mention the whole subplot where *SPOILERS* K learns He's NOT the ""chosen one"" or whatever is given to us by a completely NEW character that we've never seen in the movie or give two shits about. Then you throw in the ""we're building a revolution"" cliche and it's just downhill from there. What do we get in the end? A plot that was insanely unsatisfying.

Then of course, the constant day shots, too few of the dark, polluted cityscapes from before. The movie looked great, it did have an interesting story and it was very well filmed.

Personal Enjoyment: 7/10

Total 7.28 = C. 

However,
This film seems very hollow after my first viewing. The story felt so transparent that when certain things happened I felt like they were a massive distraction. Twists and turns in the movie felt like I was constantly underwhelmed. Other parts seemed incredibly useless. 
That being said, I can't wait to watch this movie again! I want to break it down and take notes! But right now, the movie's story feels incomplete. I totally expected a trilogy or more to come. So, if this is a stand alone film, I'm more willing to dissect it as a so. 
I also was quite upset with the movie title called B.R.2049. If anything this movie felt much more like a ""Rogue One-esk"" type of film where things from the first film where expanded on, but also had it's own story. It should have been ""2049, A Blade Runner Chronicle."" 
The gripes I have with this movie are plentiful. One of them being, the echoing feeling that there was a few too many characters & sub plots. The main story and overall film gets completely lost. There are moments were things halt the progression so much that it not only ruined the pacing, but lacked enough interest to keep me invested in the movie itself. The few times I actually was invested, nothing seemed to correlate with anything else. Why? because, the main story is short and sweet. 
This method of story telling, the engulfing of information for the audience was unique and a great ride. I just felt massively underwhelmed by the end of the movie. I wasn't even surprised by the ""Big Twist"" as I'd figured it out pretty quickly. After that point in the movie it felt like just a bunch of tantrums and action for old times sake. 
But! and there is a massive ""however,"" you see, The OG B.R took several reviews and I still get something new out of it when I watch it. I watched the OG before I watched 2049; and, the new film seemed super disconnected from the OG. 
The fun for begins with asking questions. What is all of this? What does it all mean? how does it connect? Does it connect? What's the point of it all? and many other questions! 
I think right now what's hurting my overall score is that I somehow misunderstood the story or I completely missed something. I can't wait to rewatch this movie as many times as I did the first Blade Runner and pick it apart. The movie that has taken part in the inspiration for a Book Series I'm writing entitled ""Winter's Run"" so I hope I uncover something that really makes me love it like I do the first. 

For those wondering, I rated OG Blade Runner an 8/10. I do believe it to be a classic and a great film. I think 2049 has the potential of being another classic and maybe even a better movie. I just gotta figure out wtf is going on! 😂😂😂!",none,,2021-03-08 16:19:44.793362,1

Agreed I think the visuals were fantastic and the sound engineering is some of the best I have ever heard in a theater, but the movie itself was slow moving, overlong and needed to be edited down by at least 30 minutes.
I am all into movies that use slow pacing to build tension or set the mood (a lot of film noir films do this efficiently) But then there is a point were that pacing is a determent to the story.  
Now, I do agree that Harrison Ford, when he finally does show up, is as great as anything I have seen him in but also have to mention the fantastic Jared Leto, who pulls off a performance that could have come off as gimmicky or over the top but delivers it with such sinister nuance that I wished there were more scenes with him it it.

I think one massive problem with movies today is the lack of patience from audience members which has led to movies that feel the need to throw stuff all over the screen to keep you entertained. 
This movie had amazing pacing, it was thought provoking and visually stunning with great performances; Lost arts in today's moviegoing experience. 

Everyone's entitled to their opinion but when people say the best movie they've seen ever was Star wars episode 7 or the avengers, I'm saddened. Whilst these movies are well shot and fun to watch, they are hardly a scratch on a movie like this. They are products made to entertain but they aren't great movies, at least in my opinion. 

I just hope future directors take inspiration from a movie like Blade Runner more than they do a blockbuster superhero flick.",none,,2021-03-08 16:19:44.980242,1

Fucking Masterpiece.!! WARNER BROS please spare this film. We know it didnt go well in the boxoffice just like its predecessor,but who fucking cares !! ITS CLASSIC !! ITS A MASTERPIECE !! ITS A FILM Intelligent people will be talking about for years. 
Ridley Scott ....This is how we pay the proper respect to classic films. You screwed ALIEN with that Gibberish of yours called PROMETHEUS. What a trash Film. Then Covenant..another shitty film !!   I hope from now on you learn how to make distinguishable films. 2049 is the perfect example how a movie should be made, no matter its a sequel ..prequel...etc...
Look at Blade Runner 2049 again...its eerie environment,its visual,the tone,colors,camera movement,details,lights,shades, narrative...score!!!..EVERYTHING IS PERFECT !! Dystopian to the Core. IT upgraded the first one to a whole new level without losing its magisty.
The experience i had while watching this film shall never be forgotten. I was immerse...bringing back old memories from the time when I watched the first one decades ago. I was all there but 1000 times better. My dreams came true.!!! I could die in piece now!!
Introducing new characters......narrative is simply fantastic..script rules.....the actors....my God !!! The actors....JOI is heart loving..amazing and type of woman that a man has always wanted to have.  Supportive,smart,kind,fair,sincere e allways by a man side.
HANS ZIMMER ....the king of all kings!! thank you and  Benjamin Wallfisch as well
Jahed? Fantastic
All those three girls!! Jesus! They are perfect !!!
And the DIRECTOR?  Doesnt Dennis ever make a terrible film? This guy is the new Kubrick. He is the most brilliant director of this generation!!!  YOU SAVED THIS FILM Dennis!!
Once Again WARNER...Spare This Blade Runner. The film is pg R and Its a not a film for everyone. U cannot except people who watch transformers and fast and furious to go to the cinema and watch a film of this caliber !!  Hope u guys can have your money back by lauching other films such as IT for example. Only 35 million dollars..and returner more than 600 million ! profit made !!
BLADE RUNNER IS THE MOST XPECTACULAR MOVIE of 2017. Forget about Star Wars. This is a kid blockbuster film..nothing more
BLADE RUNNER is the kind of film that makes you think,makes you move ahead,makes you go deep inside and provide you with interesting questions about AI, Humanity,real not real and Science. Moral Values...what life really means....What a soul really means.....endless possibilities...zillions of questions...I feel like the movie should never end...always asking for more.!!!
SCOTT...u have destroyed ALIEN but you will not destroy this one!!

If you think this movie is some kind of masterpiece or that it's what ""makes you remember why you love movies"" then I have some bad news for you: this movie is trash and your taste sucks. 

The original was a masterpiece due to its imagery and subtlety. That is the keyword for any great piece of art: subtlety. Not main characters blurting out long and explanatory monologues that just sound plain dumb and senseless. That is called lazy-storytelling. Or in the world of creative writing, unnecessary INFODUMPS 

The original (Final Cut) version was 1 hr and 57 minutes long. Now why in the hell do you want to make a 3 hour movie to tell some stupid family love story that has almost no connection at all to the original (save for some shots and sound bits here in there, which felt very forced). If you are going to make a 3 hour long movie, it better have a story that requires that length. Not characters walking around at glacial speed. The sex scene with the hooker and the hologram, oh my God, that should have ended after the first minute or better yet never have happened at all. So, so supid the way they ""blended together"" lol that was one of the worst scenes I have ever seen in any movie in my entire life. 

The music was horrendous, loud, obnoxious, like something from a Christopher Nolan movie that thinks ear-shattering music makes for excellent mood. It doesn't. At times the music and shots looked pretty cool, and you could feel some of the old BR, but most of the time it was just (physically) painful. 

I was curious how they would handle the story/plot, connecting it to the original Blade Runner. It turned out to be some trite Hollywood family bullshit drama that has been used a hundred times. Nothing interesting here. There is some ludicrous twist at the end but by then you could hardly give a fuck. They pull the old hero comes back from the dead to save the day routine which you could obviously see coming a mile away. There is a lot of cheap karate fighting, with flying kicks and such, and some glaring plotholes as well.

I also blame what Marvel has done to movies, they are all style and no substance who spoonfed the audience every plot point and because of Marvel people forgot what a real story looks like.

The replicants wanted more life. Yes, they killed. But humans kill. They wanted life. Humans want life. They met their god, found him wanting, and destroyed him, as a human might do. Where is the line between human and replicant then? Blade Runner let us decide. Blade Runner 2049 wants to explain everything. It's conclusions are trite and the twist raises a shrug from me. I see people praising this script and I can't understand why. I found the nature of a love relationship to be an interesting sidebar in the movie, but that was about the only point of interest. Yes, it looks great, but it is like going on a date with a mannequin in that sense. Dress it up how you like, it can't hold a conversation. This movie was a great disappointment given all the hype.

I'm still in high school, with the dream of becoming a film director one day. I'm working hard towards that, but it is all a process.

I don't have a lot of money to go to the theater, and when I do I want to watch something good.

I begged my dad to take me to the best theater in my country to watch Blade Runner 2049 for my birthday after watching this review.

When the movie was starting up, I got nervous. What if it isn't amazing? What if I don't like it? What if it neither inspires me or fills me with the fear of never being able make something that lives up to it? What will thay say about me, both as a person and a film lover?

Suffice to say, I loved every second of it. See, I've always had trouble defining what my favorite movie was. I could never place my finger on any which movie, and I've seen many a masterpiece. Every second of this movie evokes a feeling of awe and joy in the art of film making, something that no other film has done before for me. This movie both inspired and frightened me. I'm more deadset than ever to be a film maker, but at the same time I fear I'll never make something this good.

All in all, I'd say Blade Runner 2049 is my favorite movie of all time.",none,,2021-03-08 16:19:45.190856,20

The audience in London was middle-aged which doesn't bode well for the revenue. Some walked out half-way through which doesn't bode well either.  Wallace is a completely undeveloped character but we're stuck looking at his moody stares with opaque corneas over and over again anyway.  There are bizarre plot gaps like the bad guys fire attack rockets from their flying cars, render K incapable, come kidnap Deckard, and leave K unconscious but alive so he can come back and kill them all later on. They needed Scott Evil from the Austin Powers movies to go get the gun from his room and put a bullet in K's head. Plus points on the original include Ryan Gosling being less of a jerk than Harrison Ford, and the graphics. Otherwise the new movie doesn't really stand comparison with the original - most significantly IMHO was the remarkable acting of each of the replicants in the original, each making the most of their respective character, as did the actors playing Tyrell, JF Sebastian, Holden, Bryant and Gaff. Bladerunner 2049 has little in it to compare.",none,,2021-03-08 16:19:45.190914,0

To put it crudely, it is a visionary bore-fest, but as much as possible I want to like it. Personally, I respect all the efforts they placed in the script-writing, but if the general public doesn't like the film, it is completely justifiable. 
The characters lack development and proper motivation. We know that K wants to find out the mystery of his past and who his parents are, and we as audience are convinced at half-way point that he was the chosen child ""chosen one"".
K himself does not care about the revolution nor his duty as a cop nor the corporate interest of Wallace. He just wants to find his real purpose, the entire 2 hour of the film was basically ""THE CALLING"" in the hero's journey, K has not gone on an ""adventure"" to fulfil this purpose. He believes he was the chosen child, but did nothing significant as "" the chosen one"". He seems to be acting on his own interest, but in truth he was being manipulated by everyone else. He was told by his boss to erase all evidence, even though he doesn't want to. He was used by Wallace to find Deckard, though that was never his intention. He was later told to kill Deckard for the greater good, though he himself does not believe in the revolution. 
In pursuing his own identity, he forgot someone who is a true mother to him, Lieutunant Joshi. That one scene when they talked about K's implanted memories showed that Joshi indeed cared for K. Her death seemed like a convenient plot device, and destroyed the purpose of that initial scene; K does not even know that Joshi is dead, and does not even mourn for her. 
K only "" realise"" his true calling at close to the end of the film. That plot twist revealing that he wasn't the chosen one is somewhat brilliant, but it destroyed K as a character in story-telling. He had basically gained no true knowledge of himself from the first 2 hours of the movie, despite his sacrifices. There is no reason as to why K felt compelled to save/kill Deckard in first place. He doesn't care about the revolution, and is only being told to do something by another higher authority figure. What is his true motivation behind saving Deckard? I like to believe that there is one, but it is not well-explained. That scene with the giant Joi reminded K that there is no turning back, and that he should see things through. But it would have been understandable, in fact much more human, for K to just walk it off and forget about Deckard. We as audience followed K with his beliefs that he was the one. When the plot twist came, it is already at the 2 hour mark and K is suddenly purposeless. The movie has lost its steam by then. 
K's death in the end, contributes absolutely nothing to the story or the development of its characters. In the original film, both Tyrell's and Roy's death signifies something. Tyrell's death shows God being overwhelmed by the power of his own creation, along with many other interpretations. Roy's death vastly affected Deckard, teaching him the fragility of life and the importance of ""living"". 

In comparison to Roy and Tyrell, Luv (the female replicant) and Wallace seemed more like one-dimensional villains. Tyrell sincerely believed that his product will bring the course of mankind to a new technological age, and he intentionally blurred the line between human and replicants. He challenged social and philosophical concepts, and was never portrayed as a villain, but a corporate genius. Wallace, on the other hand, just babbles on and on about his own ambitions. Wallace is a selfish artist, and all he does throughout the film can only be interpreted as ""villainous"". He killed a freshly born replicant, he killed the clone of Rachel, all just to get the child whom he would later dissect. He does things for his own interests only, and you can never empathize with him as a character. Tyrell is more human than Wallace, and hence more relatable. Luv's portrayal throughout the film is kinda just like that stereotypical assassin hired by the bad guys to chase after the main characters. She was hinted to be more than just a mindless robot following orders, but much of her character remains undeveloped despite great potential. What does she really feel about the implication of a replicant baby? Why was she crying for the new replicant model who was killed by Wallace ? There are certain romantic tension between her and K that was abruptly ended with her death in the last scene. She herself has no desire, no passion, no motivation to do the things she want to do. Unlike Roy, who was more human than human, she became a convenient plot device drone. The only character given much focus upon is Joi, the artificial intelligence. She reminded me much of Scarlet Johansson in the movie ""Her"", which explored similar concepts. But her role in the film is not extremely important, so is her death. She did convince K that  to dig further into his past. That was her primary role. When that goal is fulfilled, she was conveniently killed off.
 The main issue of this movie is the script. I genuinely believe that the director and scriptwriters are heading in the right direction, but the pacing of the film and the motivations of the characters could be improved upon. Certain scenes lingered on for too long, and the soundtrack never. stops. playing. I love Vangelis, but in this film the atmosphere is sometimes a little suffocating and monotonic because of it. Anyway this is my opinions on Blade Runner 2049. I like the film, but it is definitely not great.",none,,2021-03-08 16:19:45.192702,6

Don't get me wrong, overall this film was amazing. The acting, cinematography, special effects,  story, etc. were really intriguing and well done. But those two things really bugged me throughout. I love a good villain, the villain in the original Blade Runner was compelling, fascinating, and a tragic figure who you couldn't help but sympathize with. But here the main bad guy is a cheesy James Bond villain.",none,,2021-03-08 16:19:45.357690,0

I was disappointed with the movie, the storyline was unoriginal and cliched with so many movies before hand having the same storyline.
The supposed big reveal twist was one of the weakest I've seen, and yet the director seem to make such a big play out of the twist reveal, as if no one could have predicted the so called twist.......sorry I knew who the ""special one"" was as soon as they appeared on the screen!
It's not so much that only those intellectual enough can appreciate 2049, perhaps it's those NOT intellectual enough to see how flawed 2049 is as a movie.

The original was a beautiful neo noir film that progressed slowly but it wasn't boring because you  were captivated by the dark and sad but all the while colourful scenes. Blade Runner 2049 sucked ass because the soundtrack was utterly horrible and what was supposed to be music was instead loud pounding bangs and shit(the worst part is that they tried to bring back the old soundtrack at the end when Ryan died by playing ""Tears in Rain"" trying to copy how Roy died in the original), Ryan Gosling's character should not have been the main character (rick deckard should have been the main character and he should have been introduced earlier instead of 2 hours in) The fact that  Jared Leto was cast in just ruins it. Why are the new replicants legal but all the old ones have to die? The action scenes were also too violent and long which is nothing like how the original was like and it takes away from the whole feel of the movie, the original was somewhat ""aesthetic"" I guess you could say because it had the right amount of romance and action without ruining the dark and soft vibe of the film.

I also felt like it would bore some people because modern society is just plain stupid and higher level art doesn't catch fight away, just like how great music tends to be overlooked on the radio, all you get are the bubblegum simple songs they become hits, usually. Part of the fact it isn't doing well in theaters is probablyBc dumb audiences didn't have a clue what it was about and are too used to being force fed how to feel about a movie. Also it was a little long but really, it makes the movie more epic and I love a long movie with a story that feels important. Maybe lack of action sequences also hurt the movie sales, cuz again, dumb audiences. Ryan goslings relationship in the movie was really fascinating to me and seems unfortunately probable.

BUTTTT: now we have this out of the way, let us get this thing some actual critic. Problem No 1 is the soft-reboot/nostalgia/callback but different, but not so much from the old one-treat.
This is a unsolveable challenge, so better do something new at this point: i find the whole movie highly unnessesary, it's like the same basic philosophical questions, the first one and TONS of other ones (inkluding countless Star-Trek episodes and other sci-fi media) asked better. it's boring from start to end. The Matrix part about ""you're the one, but you're not the one, etc."" is weaker than in The Matrix, the ""Her""-Part is weaker than in Her, the arc of the protagonist is super-thin and kind of over 2/3 in the movie, as he finds out, what his status actually is. Deckard is lame, and so are all the other ones. The antagonistic female replicant has no real purpose or motivation, and her boss (and the protagonists boss also) is absolutely pointless, so is the whole rebellion-part of the movie. no character is likeable through the whole movie. this was very unsatisfying. also the ending is super pointless and like the dumbest thing. yes, they eliminated one little threat, but suddenly decide to ignore all the other (much bigger) ones, just to have a cute ""i'm finally home""-scene.
if i have to compare this to the original, then i rather go with the cheesy neo-noir setting, a flat washed down detective and a few over the top villains and the open ending. 
the whole world in the old one seemed much more lived-in and there were much more bizarre characters which seemed to have much more of a somewhat believable motivation. the soundtrack is also superior. The Hans Zimmer horns are just annoying at this point (but there are a few scenes where it works really well) and the strong callback to the original themes never evoked the same punch as the old one (which i watched just a day before in preparation of the new one).
The movie is beautifully shot, yes, but is does more of a distraction, than adding to the world building as in the old one. for instance, the caustic-visuals just serve ""hey look at me, i'm creative"" as the search-lights of the ads-zeppelin lighting up the old building, which say also something about creativity, but also remind you of a much bigger world outside with its ad for the outworld colonies.
the whole movie is empty and sterile. the overly attention-craving visuals wore itself off pretty fast for me. if i want to look at nice compositions just for the sake of it, i look at concept art.
so, maybe this was kinda harsh, despite giving the movie credit for being a little step in a more artistic/visionary direction than all the other big names.. but it's nowhere this visually visionary and nice mash up from old and new as the old one was. it's pretty forgettable and in 30 years, i doubt it will be considered as somehing this special.
as i said, in the end it left me pretty empty and unsatisfied. maybe i expected to much, after all the hype.",none,,2021-03-08 16:19:45.358446,0

This is the one most boring and stupid movies I have ever seen. Forget about the visuals, there is no substance to the plot and many of the scenes are so incredibly long and boring as hell.The constant synthesizer blasting noise for every scene of f***ing traveling in that city was plainly awful.You would expect some explosive actions in connection with those imposing sounds ,but no.
It starts with the main character who kills in cold blood a ""android"" (who looks exactly like a human) that did nothing wrong and was minding his own business peacefully, just because he has to do it and I am supposed to feel for this killer for the rest of the movie, seriously?! In my opinion the normalization of murder in these Hollywood movies is one of the reasons of the mass crimes unfolding right now in USA.
And you have no character development just some stupid revelations that take too long to happen and some gruesome scenes like when Wallace cuts the belly of that freshly born woman just so that she cannot procreate and leaves her bleeding on the floor.Don't even get me started on how they made Wallace look like Christ.This movie is just a satanic depiction of the director's evil imagination.Oh,and people say,""well the first movie was stellar and this is just a continuation of it"" .I get it but this does not make this movie any better and to show this kind of disgusting atrocities to fresh audience just to satisfy the old ""fans"" is just plainly wrong.
The ending is too abrupt, with the evil still being out there and the main character acting like nothing happened and that's it. There is no real revenge going on and no certain conclusion.I wish that after the self discovery of K ,he went after Wallace and reinstated order,with peace making between humans and androids,but instead he is just fine with killing Luv.
I am not one of those action heads ,that dislikes everything else,but this movie is too much to bear in terms of pointless cruelty that does not go anywhere,for the whole 2.7 hours.There is nothing connecting you emotionally to the main character,so you would care about his faith,because he is just brainwashed evil to begin with.
To sum it up, it was too much sterile gruesome violence and killings in cold blood, all shown in great landscapes and surroundings but nothing more.",none,,2021-03-08 16:19:45.358979,0

I gotta say, this is by far the most sloppiest film Villeneuve have made. Which may not be his fault, because one of the writers of this movie was the man who did Green Lantern. The dumbest scenes involve the police station. For example, the evil bitch replicant walks unnoticed into a room of evidence, kills forensic expert, and then just walks away. Like, what kind of police station is that? Don't they have, like, surveillance cameras? Couldn't they find her fingerprints all over the the damn thing? Because I'm sure she did not wear any gloves. She was putting the damn bones of Rachel into her fucking bag, for fuck's sake. And then, next time, she walks into the room of the head of police station, and kills her right in her office? What the fuck was that? So, a replicant walks into a police station - a police station that is haunting replicants - and kills its members, without any attempt to cover her footsteps? Is this supposed to be the world where replicants are in higher hierarchy than humans and they are above the law and no one can bring them in? But that's fucking bullshit, because the entire premise of both Blade Runner and its sequel is that replicants are filth beneath humans and they don't have equal rights. So how does that work?

It's not a movie for the average American audience. It's a European styled movie, like Drive was. It allows itself to be silent, to be oppressive, to be long and difficult. Like you said, maybe we didn't need those reminders when the story unfolds. I think it has a lot to do with Ridley being producer, and letting Denis making the film he wanted to make. An average American producer would have said ""don't we need uplifting orchestral music here ?"" ""isn't this scene too long and difficult too watch ?"" ""can't you cut the movie by 40 min so we can make more money by adding more screenings per day ?"". And I'm so fed up with many Youtube critics out there who don't understand the movie like Grace from Beyond The Trailer.

The cinematography and sound was phenomenal. I'm not going to argue with anyone on that. I also found some of the metaphors in this film clever. I just felt like they were setting up another movie with Jared Leto character. We didn't get to see what happened to his character at the end of the movie. The pacing I thought kinda sucked. I could tell that the people in the theatre I was in were looking at there phones every scene where nothing interesting was happening. I was horribly confused at some moments in the film. That could be because I haven't seen the original or maybe the director purposley made it that way. I know that this is an artsy film but I wouldn't call this film a masterpiece. Would I consider it a bad movie? No. I just thought it was good nothing more.

Beautiful score, cinematography, atmosphere and good performances all round........but frustratingly in terms of its themes. It's not that there is a lack of themes in 2049 but that they feel a little scattershot and underdeveloped at times. The film has so much plot to get through (something the original had very little of) that it means that some aspects of the film get rushed or put on hold while the plot moves forward.

And I'd like to add:
For an old guy, who watched the original, in the cinema, back in 1982 (I was 13 then), this had a deeper added feeling, that I never expected. It felt like I was back. Back in a dark, depressing, bleak Los Angeles, that I had visited before. Because - just as in the original - the attention to detail was again so mind numbingly brilliant, and the scenes allowed to be so long - that I was once again pulled in. For some 2 hours and 43 minutes - I was there. In this dystopian mega city, where tacky neon signs of overblown proportions try to lure you in. I haven't had that feeling of being transported somewhere else, while watching a movie for a long long time.

The film is basically a pretentious mess. Minimal dialogue but many long silences, screechy sound effects in place of a sound track (we miss you Vangelis!), tiny title cards that were hard to read (especially for those of us up the back of the auditorium), and a script that at times did not seem to make a whole lot of sense.

And, yes, this film really does feel like an arthouse film made with a blockbuster budget.

What's more after watching this movie it makes me appreciate why they put that voiceover (which many detest) over the original. I wish they had done the same here. It might have made the film more comprehensible.

Denis Villeneuve's previous film (Arrival) was similarly incomprehensible, so I'm seeing a pattern here. If this is how he intends to keep making movies then sooner or later the moguls will stop giving him money and he will have to go back to making pretentious low-budget films instead of pretentious big-budget ones.",none,,2021-03-08 16:19:45.780685,0

I went to see it on the weekend and I was glued to the screen the whole time.  I will likely be going to see it again and it is a guaranteed Blu Ray purchase for me on release.  It's a real shame it is doing so poorly at the box office.  I attribute it to the general movie going audience's desire to be sedated by the mindless action oriented films we see so often these days.  It's really unfortunate because in the rare case when a well thought out masterpiece is released to theaters it fails miserably, which likely means such films will be even more rare.  I was shocked when I went to see it because I was expecting a packed theater, and counting myself and my girlfriend there was only 9 people viewing the movie.  Well on the plus side we got the choice seats.  Anyway, anyone reading this who hasn't seen the film, if you are a fan of sci-fi or deep story lines you owe it to yourself to see this movie.

Also I thought the movie was okay. Beautiful cinematography and they clearly had a vision, however I feel they didn't quite manage to capitalize on said vision. Leto's character was completely pointless. I feel they should have had him as a sort of ""G-man"" never getting to see his face or something. Now he just sits there spouting some bible-esque quotes, adding nothing to the plot. Luv would have been fine as the only antagonist. Leto's character's presence plus the resistance war teasing is pure sequel-bait, if not, check back in a couple of years and prove me wrong. :D",none,,2021-03-08 16:19:45.988622,0

I have been guilty of the same thing, ie Indy 4 and Star Wars 7. Walking out the cinema, happy to just have revisited familiar universe. But once the nostalgia wears off, you realise how flawed it actually is.

The cinematography and sound was amazing I'll give them that. But the plot and characters were very weak. There was no logic to the storyline, potholes big enough to drive an 18 wheel through. I wasn't disappointed, as I was never expecting much, I heard the rave reviews before had, but new most the critics same age as me, 30 something growing up with late 70s, 80s and early 90s cinema, where just viewing this mediocre flick with nostalgic eyes.

Ps Denis is one of my favourite directors at the moment. But unfortunately I think his hands were tired having RIDLEY Scott as producer. I think if Denis was left to his own device's, he would of created something special. But under RIDLEY Scott who has single handedly destroyed the Alien franchise with his latest two attempts. Just leave these classics along.

Ps Chris comments about this being a stand alone flick, far from it. It's such a setup for future films it ain't funny, that's why it's such a mess. Because there is so much setup and no explanation or reason.....",none,,2021-03-08 16:19:46.216093,2

In opening, I would like to point out that I loved the original Blade Runner.   And I was excited and a little concerned about Blade Runner 2049.  I enjoyed the story and where they went with it, it was beautiful and the script was solid.  But I had issues with the length.  There were points where it seemed liked scenes were fillers and not useful or having a point.  And I was a little sad with how they didn't use Harrison Ford more.  The way I measure a movie is when I leave the cinema.  If I talk about them on the way home and discuss what we saw and theories about what happened.  I have issues shutting up when I'm excited about something.  With this?  I didn't.  Maybe I missed something, maybe I was comparing it too much to the original.

I've been binge watching your reviews in the last few weeks, and I find them reliable and thoughtful, and so was the review of this movie. I think at a certain point it's matter of taste right? But I still want to get my opinion out there to get it out of my system. 
I agree with you that visuals in this movie are absolutely astonishing, in every way. As it is the sound track. Aesthetically speaking this movie is a landmark for cinema, something to look back at when trying to do something truly beautiful. 
My main issue with BR 2049 lays probably in that after all: the excess of aesthetic tension. 
What I mean by this is that this movie lacks the gripping, bleak, concrete feeling of its predecessor. That honest, consequential realistic narration that was present in the first has been somehow lost in this iteration. In the original the plot is very practical and straightforward: a cop that hunts replicants has to track down and get rid of a group of them that is causing some serious trouble. In his search he falls in love with a woman. Not really original right? And yet, in such a streamline plot all the philosophy and the bigger themes the underlay this movie have the space to unfold, making us understand quite rapidly that we’re watching much more than just a well directed Sci-fi flick. The dialectic creator-created sips through every second of the first BR and it moves us making us feel for those replicants trying to understand why they have been created with such magnificent and yet ephemeral frames. The character of Deckard immerses us in the bleak, noir atmosphere of the world, depicting him as a resigned, unhappy man that still has to do what he has to do because such is the world he lives in. Pris is so subtly amazing, showing us the great conflict that pervades replicants: she is a pleasure model, fit to be used for the pleasure of others. That is her purpose. And yet, once she rebels against the yoke imposed on her by her creators, she shows us the slick, intelligent and dangerous creature that lives under her skin. And Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer) in the role of the new Adam, outraged by the arbiter of his god, mister Tyrell, upon him… doesn’t he portrays one of the most compelling roles in Science Fiction cinema? His desperate longing for just more life, for freedom, for self-determination is not only inspiring and thought provoking, but also moving. A villain that in the end reveals as the victim, as someone that in love of the life he is not allowed to have spares the life of his persecutor, a man that has killed many of his kin. 
His monologue in the rain remains one of my favorite spoken lines in the history of cinema, I have it on my mp3 reader and I listen to it every now and then. 
None of this unforgettable moments or characters are present in Villeneuve movie. The actors are all doing a masterful job, but the characters they are portraying are shallow, mono dimensional. This director feels to me so occupied into making of every shot the most beautiful image possible that he forgets about a solid narration. Some of the dialog seem more like a piece of theater acting than actual people talking to each other. The Joi hologram girl seems to be there just to provide us with some visually unforgettable scenes, but her romance with K doesn’t add anything to him nor her, except maybe make us unnecessarily glimpse into the subject of AI, which seems as a misstep towards a topic for another movie. The villains are even more transparent than the protagonists, and the reasons behind the plot itself appear fragile and scarcely believable. 
Some of the scenes in the movie are dragged on to tiresomeness by what looked to me as the need to show us how they can make look beautiful the most unnecessary shots, which was the cause for me of a sense of frustration, as if the movie was constantly teasing me without ever granting narrative release.
I will watch this movie again, just because hell, it is Blade Runner after all, but I have to say that I was disappointed by it.",none,,2021-03-08 16:19:46.392021,0

It's a dense and rich movie and you will catch small things upon second viewing that you missed the first time.)

If you saw and liked the original Blade Runner (any version), you'll definitely like this movie! If you like cerebral, thoughtful movies, you'll almost assuredly like this movie. If you don't mind movies like Solaris, 2001, Her, and even the original Star Trek movie, then you'll probably like this movie. But if none of those movies appeal to you, or you don't like deliberately slow-paced movies, or you prefer lots of action, or you can't sit still for 2.75 hours, then maybe you might not like it.

Personally, the original is one of my all-time faves, and, after watching the new movie twice in two days, I'm simultaneously both more impressed than before and more critical than after the first viewing. I dare say that I enjoyed it more than before. I especially like the first half, before he meets Deckard. Up until that point, it's nearly perfect.

I must be contrarian and say that I am underwhelmed with the score. It's either unobtrusive ambient synth, or a nearly (and at times exactly) direct copy of the Vangelis original (especially the ""Tears in Rain"" ending), or over-the-top blown-out bass which sounds like an airplane landing. And I still feel like the super loud parts were overdone, especially in scenes that didn't seem to call for it.

Now for the nitpicks:

--> When K first thought he might be human, why didn't he use that device to check his eye for a serial number?

--> After failing the baseline test, he was told he had 48 hours. So why didn't he know that the LAPD would be able to follow him? It's never revealed if they have tracking devices implanted into them or not, but he at least should have ditched his police-issue car.

--> Why didn't JOI see the prostitute replicant place the tracking device in his coat? (Was she turned off? Why? We hear the chime later, but never see him turn her on.) The assumption is she always watching, just like when she knew that K hadn't told the police chief about the birthdate from his memory.

--> Why did Wallace have to send Deckard ""off world"" in order to torture him? You mean he doesn't have everything he needs on Earth, where he is and where he makes the new replicants?

--> How was K even able to track Love when she was transporting Deckard off world?

--> Why didn't K kill Deckard? I had thought he would side with the replicant rebellion. (Maybe he still felt a bit like Deckard was his ""father"" even after he realized that it wasn't true, but still...)

--> Why would they think that everyone will assume Deckard drowned? Come on. Wouldn't it be more logical to assume that Wallace would not be satisfied until he found a body...? Surely they have the technology to find it.

--> I don't think K should have died from his knife injuries. Yes, it was a vicious wound, but look at all he did AFTER receiving the injury. Also, they made it clear earlier in the movie that replicants are tough and can handle injuries that would likely kill a normal human.

--> Love is a cool villain, but she was still a bit too one-dimensional. Personally, I would have liked to have seen more depth and more ambiguity, (much like Roy Baty from the original where he saves Deckard at the end so he has someone to watch him die).

IMO, I didn't like K's ""apparent"" death - too much trying to mirror the Roy Baty death scene. If anything, I think it would have been more poetic and made more sense for Deckard to have died. K should have lived to join and become a leader of the upcoming replicant rebellion (which would make a great topic for the next movie, BTW).

Yet, all of this being said, I still think I liked it even more after the second viewing, especially the first half/two-thirds. The longer the movie goes, the more convoluted it becomes and the more the thread unravels.

It's still a great movie! But that doesn't mean that it doesn't have flaws. It could have been even better... Nevertheless, I'd still give it a 9/10.",none,,2021-03-08 16:19:46.597118,0

Not to mention the original movie's directors cut is vastly superior in terms of pacing and earnestness of the acting. 5/10 at best.",none,,2021-03-08 16:19:46.597310,0

Great movie but I wanted to drop a comment here. Sony Pictures (global) censored the copies they've sent to Turkey in order to be ""respectful"" to the fucking ""local culture"". They completely cut some scenes that contain nudity and they even cut sentences in the middle. For some scenes they zoom to the portions of the frame where there are no breasts and buttocks, so the visual was very distorted and low resolution in the IMAX screen. And they've done this all on their own without any government body's request (that too is unacceptable for me though) It was so infuriating. I paid to see the whole movie and as far as I'm concerned, Sony Pictures didn't deliver. They had no place deciding what local culture is and what they're ALLOWED to see.

Ryan Gosling very good, but that’s not a surprise. The villain sidekick is a horrible and mean person that I really hated, so very good : )  bewwwwwbs everywhere, asses as well.

Sadly, I'm forced to watch in in 3D, which sucks in general and particularly this movie as it makes everything too dark and blurry. That said...it was a long sit, which doesn't have to be bad. So was Hatefull Eight, and that was a great movie where nothing much happened. BR2049 is a bit overstylized and the score too bombastic for my liking. The plot was OK, a bit farfetched and the ""twist"" in it unsurprising and predictable if the viewer paid attention. All in all, I don't think this movie deserves the rating it received. It was enjoyable notheless as this was one of those flicks you can zone out of for a few minutes, come back and haven't missed much except some pretty scenery.

Weirdly, this was one of those movies where people actually left the theatre halfway through, never seen that happening. Guess this will go into history as yet another cult classic.",none,,2021-03-08 16:19:46.787501,0

As for Blade Runner 2049...I was a little disappointed. Lets go over the positives first. This movie is stunning and beautiful to look at, the cinematography is brilliant! It's truthfully mind blowing and almost worth the price of admission alone. This movie also had a lot of interesting Sci Fi elements that are new and innovative, like Ryan Gosling's holographic girlfriend. I've never seen anything quite like it, it was pretty cool. The actors were all very strong in their performances, so much so that it left me wanting more from certain characters. I really enjoyed Jared Leto's performance, he's pulls off an especially creepy and mysterious character. I wanted more Leto to be honest.
Negatives
This film is slooooooooowwww and too long! And I love slow movies usually! They unnecessarily stretch scenes out to the point where you're bored....and as a BIG Blade Runner fan it pains me to say that! I'm upset actually that l felt this way about this movie. The movie has pacing issues for sure. I also found the main plot of the story a little thin, it wasn't hard to get lost in this movie and wonder where are they going with this? They tried to throw a twist in, but truthfully when the twist is unraveled or revealed I didn't care, it was underwhelming. For a movie being 2 hrs 40 mins l actually expected more out of it. Certain scenes were too long and drawn out, and other parts were sorrily lacking depth. The original Blade Runner story is way better in my opinion. Also Harrison Ford doesn't even show up until the last 40 mins and by the end of movie I thought to myself, ""did they even really need him?"" Overall the movie is OK, which again sucks for me to say, because if the pacing and story was a little bit stronger and things flowed a bit better this movie could have easily been a 10/10 for Sci Fi. To sum it all up it's a good movie with some extraordinary visuals and very cool Sci Fi technology/elements and the acting is strong, but has serious pacing problems, it's too long and the story is average. LOL the first Blade Runner has a faster pace! So to all those people who thought the first one was slow, don't even bother with this one. I would definitely watch Blade Runner 2049 again as I feel I could definitely learn new things and l want to see if my opinion changes to a more positive one.

Okay, so I loved the first blade runner for its very philosophical and metaphorical dialogue (and of course the world/visuals), and for some reason I was anticipating similar dialogue in this new one. And after the film I was feeling very weird about the movie, like something was missing or feeling off. And now looking back that anticipation was a mistake, because this movie wasn't aiming for that, it was aiming more for the the visuals and telling the story with subtle acting and long and wide shots, like K's face expressions etc. (similar to Drive). Of course there are some ""deep"" dialogue (mostly Leto's character, which I didn't like that much either, but was okay), but it was kept very minimal. 
So the point was that don't anticipate a ""reboot"" (like Chris said) or a copy of the first movie. It does some things very differently compared to the original, but boy does it do them right. And even though it is its own film, it ""honors"" the first blade runner very much. 

*Actual spoilers*
The last fight was kind of anticlimactic (hang on), and could have been slight better. Like it could have taken place in a better environment, like Wallace headquarters or something. And overall, the ending felt kind of rushed, and probably some scenes were edited out, so fingers crossed for the final/director's cut. 
These were some (very) minor flaws that could have made differently in my opinion, but doesn't mean were bad in anyway.",none,,2021-03-08 16:19:46.961020,0

He's either ""pure praise"" for a movie or ""this movie sucks"", there's never any subtlety or nuance to his reviews anymore. Case in point stephen king's IT had a number of glaring problems (such as IT appearing in every single scene! so suspense is killed), and now with blade runner 2049, he misses out on a lot. For example --- there's at least two chunks of 45 min each where the audience is saying ""WE GET IT"" the entire time, the plot point was utterly predictable....yet there's the musical score reaches a point of orgasm as if to say ""this point is important! look how deep it is! i bet you didn't see that coming!"" really??? it was predictable from 45 mins ago and the movie paints it as some huge revelation! Ugh. I almost walked out at this point. This happened TWICE in the movie. And each chunk i swear to god was 45 mins long each, completely boring and predictable (spoiler: those points were: (1) entering the orphanage an (2) entering the huge hotel where dekkard is).

Also the plot for this movie is weak and sentimental -- i HATED the x-men like ""we're going to get together and form a revolution, to free our kind"", so kitsch and been done a thousand times before.

Honestly, this movie wasn't that good --- it was one of those movies where it's clearly become trendy to SAY it's good but people are just not being honest or they're simpletons. Admittedly it's better than the majority of scifi out there, but it absolutely does not hold a candle to the orignal movie, not even CLOSE. This film felt bloated, boring, weak (plotwise) and over-produced/directed with much too much boring ""kung fu"" fights that just feel like filler.

First off It's a visual spectacle from beginning to end. The film looks really good. Storywise...? it's boring, spoilers ahead and comparison from the first blade runner. K or Joe is 100x better than deckard was in the first film. 2nd, the replicant lady is no roy batty, thus this movie doesn't have a good antagonist. Which is a disappointment. There are some scenes that can be cut in order to keep up the pace because this movie drags. Dennis Villeneuve is good at cinematography but not good at filming action scenes. Now the story has a good premise but the execution is meh. especially towards the end. They revealed the person they we're looking for in a snap, in a blink of an eye. All that build up and they just slapped the answer in your face. There are still plotlines hanging around and some questionable aspects in the world of blade runner that makes it not believable. Like where are security cameras? Where are the guards? etc. This movie reminded me of children of men but children of men executed the ""child"" that will bridge the path to peace better.

I know fans of the og will love this film, as for me I didn't like the first one. All I can say is that it's better than Ghost in the shell but not good as Dredd/Total Recall(New one) and people don't like the new one.",none,,2021-03-08 16:19:46.961501,0

And I can't be the only one who was bored out of my fuckin' mind for the majority of the first and second half of the film. It isn't until when Harrison Ford's character shows up that it picks up cuz it plods along with artsy scenes that last waaaaaaay too long lol. I mean i get it. It's about discovering your humanity and all that, but i mean how long do we need to see ryan gosling stare at a ladybug on his hand, contemplating the meaning of his existence and whatnot lol! There's too many scenes like that. They just come off as annoyingly philosophical and shit. 

Don't get me wrong i don't think it was bad, but i can't say that the middle part wasn't boring for me. I was literally doing my best to stay awake. Which sucks cuz i wanted to like this film so much. 

But i thought the storytelling was solid, ryan gosling's character was great and i liked his progression as a person. The visuals were fantastic! But in my opinion i thought ghost in the shell had better visuals of future tech. 

But what do i know I'm just an asshole....

Sure that stuff ended in the 1960s/70s,  but still. Replicant=Chattel Slave?  I love Blade Runner but still.",none,,2021-03-08 16:19:46.962610,4

Granted he didn't play his usual smug/prick self that he usually does, but he really was just reading dialogue. But the worst part about this (outside of the 3 hr run time of boredom) is that it wants you to think that it is incredibly deep, thought provoking and artsy.

It is a 9/10 100% and the best movie that I have seen in a long while. 


I saw things in this movie that I have never seen in a movie before. It is hard to break grounds in cinema these days with the advancements in CGI we have had over the last 20 years, but I was blown away with the imagery and the movie overall.


I really really hope this movie does well financially because their is definitely a sequel set up here and I want to see more of the Blade Runner universe. I agree with your ascertain that it can't stand on it's own but I want more!

WHAT MAKES THIS MOVIE BETTER THAN MOST?

1.) Plot
2.) Character development
3.) Non-cheesy & stupid twist...REAL good twists.
4.) Great acting

6.) The movie builds and builds until the end.
7.) It evokes real emotion from the viewer.


Because of what I call the ""Transformication"" (everything is like Transformers...brain-less) of movies we do not get the privilege of seeing movies like Blade Runner 2049 anymore. GO SEE IT!


P.S. I highly recommend you watch Blade Runner ""The Final Cut"" before going and seeing the movie. I watched it last night and I am really glad I got the story fresh in my mind going into the movie today. It will especially give you a better since of the ending information-wise as well as emotionally. The ending hit pretty hard because I knew the ending of the first movie.

There were NO lines that are quotable or memorable like the first. The movie even had to borrow lines from the first to punch above it's weight.

Every scene in the original the lighting was always moving, floodlights in the background, reflection, flickering lights, here it's just a plain lit room which looked boring, so uninspired, felt like a hospital room with sterile lighting, lacked shadows and contrast. I was disappointed in that area. That's the number one thing that makes a blade runner movie and there was only one standout scene with dynamic lighting and it used water reflected lighting like original. I was watching Gosling in his kitchen and just wishing a light would flicker or something to make it feel dirty and gritty, it was so clean and sterile. If they fixed that one major thing that makes even the most boring scene interesting, like original, remember the scan and enhance scene in original, it's sorta boring but the atmosphere and lighting makes the scene so dynamic, it's like art, this was too generic basic sci-fi lighting in too many scenes.

Compare this original glorious looking scene: https://youtu.be/NoAzpa1x7jU

With this bland looking scene here that just looks flat which is how a lot of the movie looks except in bursts of dynamic visuals: https://youtu.be/lAH8OrwM7Bs

I thought blade runner should just stay dead. The original was such a lightning in a bottle occurrence that I didn't think anyone could replicate that same effect. So going into this movie I didn't have much in mind and because of my pre existing bias towards the first I tried to view this film separately from that bias. And I got to say the first two acts of the film were very good. I had some personal complaints about some aspects but the core elements were very well done. The character development of our main hero was great. Allot of movies these days don't know how to get audiences invested in the characters and I genuinely cared about Ryan Goslings character. The story was interesting to follow and it was exciting to see what clues Ryan's character ""K"" would uncover next. And the villain of the movie was very well presented. It felt very much like Jared Letos character had a defined set of goals and ideology that made sense to his character but sinister to the audience. That's why I find it so disheartening that the movie ended the way it did. I feel as if all of the greatest aspects of the first two acts were completely destroyed by the 3rd and subsequent conclusion. Why make this movie about Ryan's character ""K"" to have him take a back seat so that Harrison Ford could jump in right at the end. And why set up a story with such a great adversary not to confront him. I'm just mad because in my opinion the movie had good potential but the ending just fizzled out. They had so much time to tell us a story and I feel that there are multiple ways this film could have been wrapped up into a complete package and still kept the story's integrity. Sorry for ranting so long and I'm amazed if anyone actually read this. Opinions are like buttholes everyone's got one and they all stink, this ones just mine. thanks",none,,2021-03-08 16:19:47.585663,1

When watching them back to back...while I appreciated the visuals and cinematography, I felt it was certainly flawed and not A+ worthy. While it certainly is Blade Runner-ish...it has pacing issues and was confused at times whether or not to be an art house film or an engaging sci-fi epic. The characters, especially its antagonists, are pretty one dimensional. Would I call it a good movie? Absolutely! But ""new masterpiece"" and an A+ rating is a bit of a stretch for me. I would definitely say...unless you are VERY into Blade Runner, which is a polarizing film in and of itself, you're likely to be somewhat bored at times.",none,,2021-03-08 16:19:47.586440,0

It had a lot of great aspects and talented people working on it, but it didn't come together to make a cohesive package of meaning. For example sure, the cinematography is visually stunning, but it shouldn't just be eye candy to be eye candy.  Alot of scenes have no purpose in lingering visually where they do, they offer no thematic or emotional motive, and its just 'lets try to be blade runner' rather than, let's try to tell this story.  I like slowly paced movies that have a purpose to be slowly paced.  For the amount of plot in this movie, the pacing simply wasn't justified, and overall, it came out as bloated film. Some of the plot, just simply doesn't make any sense, and in truth, if you are going to have a long film, it had better build to some seriously tense, focused, moments, which this film simply did not deliver.  Every moment was supposed to be 'epic' and in the end nothing was.  I also totally disagree with the notion that this was supposed to be self-contained film, given the fact that so much is unresolved in the end, and so many major players have a great deal to do.",none,,2021-03-08 16:19:47.586527,0

I'm feeling the same enthusiastic admiration you're expressing in this video. My mind is blown and filled with so many different thoughts and emotions, I can't even process them. I have no rational mind when it comes to Blade Runner, I only have unconditional love and admiration, so I was kind of frightened  about this sequel when I first heard of it, and I'm usually pretty skeptical. But this time, I was completely repaid. Denis Villeneuve is truly something. Visually innovative, visionary in every possible way. He perfectly knows how to use every single tool of filmmaking. This masterpiece was not only aeshtetically marvelous, it was immersive, intense in every possible way, and also emotional, phylosophical, perfectly structured in its internal logic and basically flawless when it comes to its technical aspects. Blade Runner 2049 takes everything from Scott's masterpiece when it comes to mood, scenarios and setups, and evolves into its own peculiar personality, becoming one of the modern classics we'll be talking about in decades. Ryan Gosling resembles the perfect mixtures of fierceness and human goodness, Ford is at its best. Deakins is a real god, every frame a painting. I'm just so totally impressed. I'm so moved by the way Villeneuve took the original creature, and treated it with such respect and creative talent.

You present this without giving anything away.

The very first time I saw the trailer for 2049....there was something about how it was styled....how some of the dialog was presented...that told me...Holy Shit....I've got to see this.

So how does Denis Villeneuve’s Blade Runner 2049 stand up to scrutiny? The film is different enough to avoid being a mere exercise in nostalgia (in fact in some ways it’s the original’s polar opposite) and yet it’s also a pretty direct sequel that even features footage and sound bites from Scott’s movie. It has stunning visuals but few feel like a rehash done with better effects, instead showing other parts of the dystopian world and life in it. The film’s main (or maybe only) problem is its convoluted plot presented in the slowest possible pace. There is the deep exploration of what it means to be human, of identity, of the nature of memories, but there is also confusion and odd character motivations. It seems that both sides of the story are after the same goal and their conflict seems pointless and drawn out. 2049 is a beautiful, well acted movie that has a lot to say, but it still didn’t really need to exist as it does practically nothing new.",none,,2021-03-08 16:19:47.765258,0

I am going to watch it tonight on IMAX, so I am taking your advice in seeing it fresh.  That is a problem not with the filmmakers per say but with the mainstream audience.  I have always said that 2001:  A Space Odyssey and the original Blade Runner if released now without its reputation would be panned as crap.  We are used to MTV fast editing and louder than normal that we can't enjoy a slower paced movie with ""SUBSTANCE"".  If it's not BOOM, BOOM, or BAM, BAM, every 5 minutes, then it stinks.                                                                                                              I have heard criticism that Star Trek:  The Wrath of Kahn was boring, that the scenes with Luke Skywalker and Yoda in Empire Strikes Back was boring, and that the Lord of the Rings movies is too long and boring.  It's not being pretentious.  It's just generally we as American movie-going audiences need to break the fast food mentality of movies.                                                          This is one factor that why not many people are going out to movies.  Besides the lack of quality, too many comic book films that are ""cookie cutter"" in style, too many movies made for children and teens who want BOOM, BOOM.  Make more movies like Blade Runner 2049, and people will go back to the theaters.  Make more movies for adults with adult themes and philosophy.  At least in Japan, they make anime that is adult oriented.  Like sports, a team with talent that loses a lot tend to not promote the fundamentals.  The movie industry needs to do that as well.  DC / Warner Brothers is struggling, Lucasfilm is struggling but covered by Star Wars nostalgia [if ""The Force Awakens"" was not a Star Wars film, it would have been ripped as a shell of a movie], and Marvel is on a high - but eventually it will not last.",none,,2021-03-08 16:19:47.765879,1

As a movie experience, I'd say this is what the first Blade Runner should have been (personally, I always thought that the old BR was more successful in concept than in execution). I enjoyed it but left wanting more; unlike Arrival, which I left fully satisfied.",none,,2021-03-08 16:19:47.766594,0

The movie felt like a large collection of scenes that didn't add up to anything but re-hashing some material from the original and setting up Blade Runner 2069 or whatever the sequel will be called. I am sure most video game plots aren't nearly as thin as this.

I was bored at several times throughout. The highlight and only suspense in the entire movie was scene late in the movie that took place in the ocean. This makes 4 of the last 5 movies from the director where children are at the center of the plot. I suppose that was supposed to be the shocking reveal in this movie but it just shows this director or his writers are looking for cheap, unimaginative plot elements that critics and sheep googoo and gaga for.

Just re-watched the original 2 days ago and this one pales in comparison, being almost 40 years newer, the visual effects were really nothing spectacular. Not a terrible movie but definitely NOT a great movie by any means, I would argue that those who praise this movie have very very low expectations.",none,,2021-03-08 16:19:47.971964,0

the last 10 minutes I found to be weakest of the almost 3 hrs, a cliche little wrap up and everyone goes off into the sunset type of thing, previous to that some.... ""oh I thought 'this... but its actually that""... moments, 

the first film was strong, linear, tight, a poetic ending, Roy betti as a replicant came across as intelligent, intellectual, when he spoke of witnessing amazing things on other planets you believed him!, to that end he was well developed, it was really the perfect film....this film was far less concentrated, im in awe of how some are even contemplating it could be better than the first blade runner, 

this film's photography is A+, in terms of film making technicality its also A+, it seems to have all the mechanics done right but there's something else less easy to quantify which is missing. i don't know - I was also in a shit mood entering the cinema and further to that I watched the original 24hrs before the sequel which helps for continuity but it also meant I had a little more appreciation for the original in what was a 4th viewing, so while I could have been compromised I think my points are still valid,

IMO its a very good film but well short of the superlatives been thrown around,",none,,2021-03-08 16:19:47.972305,0

Director Denis Villeneuve (Prisoners) was quoted as saying that he would not be able to make this film as good as the original Blade Runner (1982), and he was correct. This film takes place 30 years after the first one that was set in 2019 and follows Ryan Gosling (Drive) playing a young blade runner who discovers  a long-buried secret that leads him to track down a former blade runner Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford), who's been missing for thirty years.



It may be unfair to compare this belated sequel to the classic original but seeings as it is a sequel I cannot help but do so. The film in it's own right is well made and a step above most things that are going through your Cineplex these days but in comparison to the original it falls quite short in almost every way. Simply where the film does look pretty good, it does not look anywhere near as good as the original, the same can be said for all the design work and costuming which just does not have the care and inspiration of the former. The Music is good but mostly when its touting parts of the original score. The acting is good enough but not as good as the original and certainly the characters are not as good. The film also tries to emulate the slower pace of the first film but ends up being even slower and is so bloated at almost 3 hours which could've easily been 2 hours and been a better film for it with none of the themes or main story beats left out. It is more of a detective story than an action film just like the first was but the detective elements are not as strong or interesting this time around. Blade Runner 2049 does try to go in some new territory in the Blade Runner world but they are all the most obvious boring places to go that have been done before in other films and television(Battlestar Galactica, Star Trek Voyager). There are some subplots that have shades of Spike Jonze Her (2013) and there are some other scenes that are an attempt to set up further films in the franchise.



It may sound like I am being quite hard on the film but there are things to enjoy, the visuals while a little too dark and lacking the wow factor of the original cinematography from Jordan Cronenweth are still miles above most films from our age. The sound design is huge and really second to none which makes it the one area that is better than the original film. The special effects are good although they do go Rogue One with bringing back one chraracter digitally which whilst it is probably the best it has been done to date it still suffers from uncanny valley.



In the end I would say it is a solid hard scifi which suffers in comparison to its roots which its best characters are under-used and is bloated but without any iconic scenes. Remember the scene from the original with the replicant stripper being shot in the back as she smashes through glass walls in slow motion, the scene with Rutger Hauer in the elevator lit up after killing Tyrell or his final epic monologue. The new film has none of the artistry that elevates a film to masterpiece. In short, it could have been a lot worse and it is no disgrace to what now has become a franchise I guess but its far from the suspicious rave reviews that have flooded the market days before release.

It was a great movie and all, but there were frustrating moments where they didn't expect the audience to figure things out on their own and annoyingly spelled it out more than necessary.

SPOILERS FOR ARRIVAL

They did such an amazing job of letting all the pieces fall into place without the need for explanation, but then obnoxiously explain it anyway. When she calls out ""who is this child?"" it immediately hits you, oh fuck, those weren't flashbacks at all, the child in all those visions she's been having isn't actually born yet. They of course felt the need to spell that out immediately after by having the alien just flat out say ""you see the future now lmao"".

What frustrated me more though was that they show her making the decision to have a baby and that was enough to make all the drama in these ""flashbacks"" make sense. It's well established that whoever the father is of the child, she made some decision that enraged him and he left. Then we learn that Hawkeye is the father and the child came AFTER all the events of the movie, meaning after having all those visions of the kid on their deathbed. She obviously knew and willingly inflicted that grief on them anyway. It feels nice and subtle and has a lot of punch. But then of course...

As for the movie. Even with all this praise I still can't believe it would top the visuals and atmosphere of the original.

Oh and about the director (Denis Villeneuve): Arrival was a piece of shit. Even if he didn't fvcking write it, he never should have agreed to direct that trainwreck. Any sci-fi that raises time-travel paradoxes is utter garbage (unless it has an awesome story that makes the time-travel shit seem inconsequential and takes your total attention from the paradox crap). And secondly had a nihilist message of shit. I'm tired of these leftist suicidal cocksvckers with artsy subtext (that is instead hamfisted) message to ""let's all roll over and die"". And even more ""let your children die, at least you have good memories"". Arrival was one of the worst movie I've EVER SEEN.
When both paradox (hurting my passion for sci-fi) and anti-life propaganda (annoying leftist bullshit) meet, it has no fvckin redeemable qualities in my eyes.  So that about the director.
Maybe Blade Runner will fit him better. I still can't trust any critic on this, cause the original was just a noirish sci-fi masterpiece and I doubt it can be toped by anything.",none,,2021-03-08 16:19:48.382922,0

Harrison was  also kind of useless. The tragic part is, that it is a movie that asks questions about what it means to be human, but even the ""human"" characters act and feel like robots without any personality. I couldn't relate to any of the characters or feel any kind of emotional connection (Arrival was way better at doing that). Visually stunning but otherwise disappointing.

Sebastion had a genetic disorder that was going to kill him before his time. His purpose is obvious even in the first cut.

""I didn't like the romance that blossomed between Deckard and Rachel.""
Deckard, as a *human*, falls in love with someone he knows is a replicant. She had not broken any laws, saved his life, and is hot. People get married for less.

""I thought the film didn't have enough action.""
Not an action movie to begin with, yet had visuals that blew the minds of people like me that saw it when it came out. I had no problems soaking in this world as long as it lasted. Seriously, it was Star Wars level.

""I found the whole experience disappointingly hollow.""
Hollow?.... ""More human than human is our motto."". It's not illegal to be a replicant, it's just illegal to be one that has escaped and is homicidal. The whole point is that he must separate himself from his own *humanity* for the ostensible purpose of protecting other humans who are portrayed as droning automatons in a sea of people. Corporate interests... this was a theme in the 80's. Tyrell wasn't a bad man, but he was horrible to his creations.  More monster than monster.That's why it was narratively OK for Roy to destroy him. ""Hollow"" is not how I would describe this movie. Chris, I've seen your stuff, you aren't very deep.

""Do I think he's a replicant? Yeah, I kinda do.""
No no no no no. He's not.

Sorry, there's no going backsies just because 2049 is coming out. You didn't get it then and you don't get it now.",none,,2021-03-08 16:19:48.559767,1

James Cameron, although *Avatar-*- sucked my sweaty ball sack, everything else hes done has been pretty damn solid. Christopher Nolan.

Abrams, and arguably quite a few other names off the top of my head. Chris, THESE names will be remember 2-3-4-500 years from now and on, will remember those names AND OTHERS as OUR present days ""Hitchcocks Spielbergs Scorseses or even Da Vincis Picassos and Rembrandts"" of film, its the passage of TIME that makes these people into the *icons* we know them to be here in our time.",none,,2021-03-08 16:19:48.560481,0

I was expecting riots in the streets as angry fan boys destroyed everything in their path with the force that only the crushed hopes of a 35-year long wait could provide.

In short: I was expecting Kingdom of the Crystal Origami Thingie That Doesn't Really Mean Shit.

I wish you would call that movie out for the dreadful experience that it is overall.

Blade Runner 2049 is just out and already overrated! Calling it ""one of the best of this year' isn't saying much really. The fact that you are not able to call it the best (which it should be if it was even decent) says a lot about it.

It's so Japanese, in the fact that time or the passage thereof makes us or should enable us to see how things are to be appreciated as we have them. Yet, fading beauty, is still beautiful. Anyway, I am anticipating seeing this film tomorrow. I know, I'll be floored and immersed completely back into the world I left 35 years ago.

On the one hand, it's wonderful to know that the fans of the original film will not be disappointed in this movie, and that it's practically similar to T2 and other sequels in that it might actually be arguable that it's better than the original, and that is truly fantastic.

On the other hand, there's the marketing. To be quite honest, I checked myself out of this film before seeing this review because I thought, based off of the ads, that this film was just going to be a generic action flick, a film using the Blade Runner title only to get butts in the seats. Now hearing that it's not close to that whatsoever actually worries me because this was the same kind of shit that made the original Blade Runner bomb at the box office. I'm actually frightened that this film will go down that same path and bomb spectacularly because the general audience will come into this movie excepting an action romp not unlike Fast and Furious only to be disappointed/pissed that it's anything but, completely ruining any sort of proper backing it truly needs for it to be a proper success.

I hope I'm wrong with that second bit and, with this new tool we have called ""the internet"", we can spread the real information out there about this flick fast enough so it can get the box office return it deserves.",none,,2021-03-08 16:19:49.537693,0

The most concerning issue for any film lover or fan of the original should be: how is Deckard in this world at all, some 30 years later, and how is he an old man with gray hair and jowls and a flabby old man body? There are only two possible explanations (**SPOILERS FOR BLADE RUNNER FOLLOW**): 1) Blade Runner 2049 is throwing out Ridley Scott's intended ending, in which Rick Deckard is revealed to be a replicant, and thus accepting the godawful studio edit as canon; or 2) [Insert some ridiculous contrivance here]. Replicants have a 4 year lifespan. This is well-established in Blade Runner. There is literally no way to get around Deckard being alive 30 years later, and not only alive but somehow aging like a human man, without jumping through logical and narrative hoops like a fucking circus act. Some options: Deckard is some variation of the ""chosen one,"" wherein he's the most special-est replicant ever who doesn't have a lifespan built in (reducing Blade Runner to a YA novel trope). Or maybe Deckard hooked up with some l33t hackers who disabled the killswitch—how thrilling! Of course none of this explains why he aged like a human man. Replicants are manufactured. They have some biological components but they are synthetic. This is also well-established in the film. The opening crawl states replicants arose from ""advanced robot evolution,"" and in the film we can see microscopic serial numbers are etched into various components, a mark of their creator. Genetic engineering and microbiology play a role—to what degree is still debated—but it is absurd to suggest that a partially synthetic replicant which is ""born"" as a fully-formed man would then somehow be engineered to age like a human, with bone and muscle mass deteriorating and jowls forming, and fat forming, &c. Why would that even be a consideration when they were designed for a 4-year lifespan? It makes no logical sense and therefore there is no way out of this problem with introducing some ridiculous contrivance to explain it away, or avoiding the issue altogether. This alone keeps the film from being a masterpiece. It would have been better to tell a story in this universe without Deckard in it.",none,,2021-03-08 16:19:49.538308,0

The movie is truly amazing, but different then what u r probably expecting. Forget the people that say it's boring, most just went into it thinking it was going to be one thing and it's not that. Or they r probably younger kids 19-12 ..not to say that younger won't like, but it's if they have a little maturity, and how developed their frontal lobe is. Because there r big questions that should start to get u thinking, and for the millions of people that love the movie, those questions and the movie, kinda haunt u. Or people half watched it, while surfing Facebook or something..
     For me, I'm not a nostalgia person for the movie..I actually saw it young, but I thought it was slow, I wasn't prepped for it...had no idea what to expect..and didn't really like it so much. Then years later I was at a convention, and watched the AV guys set up the giant screen, and crazy speaker set up....and they put in what must have been the bluray of Blade Runner....from the first scene, I was blown away...they only played part of it , but I was hooked, on being immersed in this world. And that's what is magical about the film. I watched a thing with Ridley, and they would put things and make it real as possible, even rooms,and things OFF CAMERA, that r not even being shot, like decorating a room, even putting stuff in like a dresser in a room, off camera, that won't even be recorded, to make the actors, extras, audience feel the movie is as real as possible..
     The movie just exists, it's like we all of a sudden r put into this world, that we realize could be our world in the not so far future. The rules, laws, tech , police etc r who they r, and u accept it, because it seems so real. At that point u r following what seems, a tormented, alcoholic cop/Blade Runner, special type, and a master at his craft. The movie does not follow a traditional pace of movies, just like real life does not follow a typical pace...so yes some might say it's slow, but it's anything but...its mesmerizing..when u look at it like we r watching a specialized detective, a Blade Runner, who kills these replicants for a living, he talks hard, like they r things, ""retiring them"". But he is tormented for killing them, so some part of him feels it's wrong. 
    The movie has one of the most amazing endings of any movie..it has excitement, fear , action, twists. But the thing to enjoy is the whole experience, when it's over..( and if u don't watch the entire movie, pay attention, stay off ur cell phone. Then ur opinion will probably be negative on the movie.) Plz also make sure u r watching with the best possible picture, sound, and surroundings, lights off, very little distractions, ur favorite snacks close by etc...When I show this to friends, I won't show it unless they agree to be here for the whole thing, and if they gonna stay off cell phone, and really watch it. When they do, nearly everyone loves it..when not most say they really don't care for it..so yea there a correlation. 
     Once I saw the movie, with these expectations, I ""got it"" so I am now a huge fan, and also haunted by this movie because it's so impactful. Take the time to watch the Final cut...also look at the way many movies looked for the time, and the next 20 years with much higher budgets , and this movie blows them away. Why can Scott make movies so stunning, and every other director for the most part, cannot get even close in terms of quality? When we take all this into consideration . This movie is mind blowing. It has some similarities from The Thing..it's a mood movie, Experiencing  atmosphere is a huge part of the movie, same here. You r watching events in another time , unfold in front of u. They happen unapologetically, and we r watching it all, experiencing it all, including the "" boring"" parts, become interesting, have meaning, r part of the Whole experience.",none,,2021-03-08 16:19:49.972787,0

No showcase of subcultures, of interesting insights into the internal functionality of the society in which this movie plays out. The first act set the mood excellently, great wide shots and ominous music, made me positively immersed in the expectation of experiecing a proper dystopian world. It didn't deliver. People were hollowed out, paper mache versions of apathetic blasé dilitants. Scenes were not ""aired out"" properly, it all dragged. No characters were interestingly human, except Goslings character. Whenever we got to see inside some of the buildings, whenever we had the chance to glimpse the world beyond the beautiful wide shots, it was empty, just like a video game with NPCs. Most characters felt like NPCs. 

The story was moderately interesting. The idea that a replicant can procreate, yeah well sure it is interesting but I don't see how THAT, of all things, would change people's view on replicants. They hint at MUCH more interesting plotlines all the time, plotlines which, if pursued, would render this film much more interesting. So much more to say about this pretentious piece of crap (yes visuals amazing, but so were The Last Jedi's, and that movie sucked dick too.)  Although it was less boring but still a worse movie.

Go invent your own science fiction story about humans hunting robots, don't piggy back on Blade Runner's popularity. You can do it with Star Wars if you want to, but Blade Runner isn't Star Wars with some kind of huge unexplored universe with tons of characters to use and many possibilities beyond the Skywalker family, it was simply the personal story of Deckard in a dystopian future, so if you're doing a sequel, you better include him and show us what happened to him next instead of using Blade Runner's setting as a fancy sandbox for your shitty police story.",none,,2021-03-08 16:19:51.917280,0

And now the rambling:

I loved all the characters in this movie, and I was very gladly surprised by Leto's portrayal of Wallace. Sure, Wallace may have a god complex but he single handedly SAVED THE ENTIRE WORLD from starvation and made space colonization viable. In other words think anything Elon Musk has accomplished right now, multiply it 500 times, and tell me if his god complex is not deserved.

And while Wallace may appear to be a villain to weaker people the reality is all he wants to do is help humanity colonize the stars. He says it so repeatedly but everyone is too absorbed in their own personal bullshit to even think for a moment about the much bigger picture he is seeing, so he has to do what needs to be done to save people from themselves. There's also an extra short prequel scene on the BD extras (along with an anime short about the Blackout and a short Sapper Morton story) that shows this and how he got the Replicant prohibition revoked so his Nexus 9 could be produced. Such a great character short.

Anyway my comment was supposed to be about the movie but ended up being a Leto praise (another thing that would vindicate him would be if his Joker from Suicide Squad is actually a crazed Jason Todd. Which would make his Joker actually kind of amazing in that context) but all the characters are really good in this movie. 

Besides Wallace my favorite parts were the interactions between K and Joi as it shows how a man can create a happy relationship with an AI companion. Sure the movie makes it so you don't forget she is a product, but if you look around you'll notice K's relationship with *his* Joi was far more real than most relationships between men and women. And if you don't believe me just take a visit to your local family court, that should show you how real a woman's love is.

His Joi loved him as she was programmed to, but the point of the personal AI companion is that she adapts and imprints onto her user and becomes what he the user needs, so no two Joi develop the same way. And in the end it doesn't matter if her character was programmed, since we humans are also programmed with instincts to do certain things. What matters is that Joi's actions showed the feelings she had for him, which is more than you can ask from a ""real"" woman these days.

I could write a lot more about many other aspects of the movie but it would become a book. Which is why this movie and the original are so good since they make you really think about all these things you normally wouldn't consider. Time to watch the movie yet again.",none,,2021-03-08 16:19:51.918753,0

As for the first Blade Runner movie, I went to the library and watched both the Theatrical Cut and the Final Cut.  The Final Cut was better because it cut out that narration, had some enhanced visuals, and it cut out that happily ever after ending, but I still never had a sense that Harrison Ford was or was not a Replicant.  It never occurred to me, and it still doesn't even with 2049, it's just not where my thought process goes I guess.  And I actually liked 2049 more than the first Blade Runner and it's because it never got super weird.  The Noir stuff is great, the music is awesome, the world looks fantastic, but then all the howling and gymnastics and things that are probably more symbolic of something I was not thinking about come off as really weird, but in 2049, they made something I enjoyed from start to finish.  However, I would never ask someone to watch this movie without having seen the first movie because it did what a sequel should do, which is to expand on story and grow the world that was established before and it worked out in such a way that I found this sequel to be better than the original when that is usually never the case.  I also believe in context so even if you didn't need to, I'd still say watch the first one because it isn't a slog.  That's why I don't watch reboots or sequels without having seen the original because I'd like to know why they are being done.  I saw previews for this movie and I was like, ""Cool, I'm never going to watch it since I've never seen the original,"" and then one day I decided I might as well find a way to watch Blade Runner because 2049 did look really interesting.  Maybe I didn't like the original as much as a lot of other people because it was overhyped for me despite me going in without any knowledge or built up excitement, or it was because I was just not at that cerebral level.  2049 didn't feel like I needed to think as much and analyze my morals or whatever sci-fi is supposed to do, but it also wasn't just action thriller.  So to sum things up, I like the movie.",none,,2021-03-08 16:19:52.123139,0

By telling a character who already knows the business of blade running, they're allowing the audience into the exposition. It was lazy. The visuals were all there was to the movie. Style, in my honest observation, over substance. You don't have to agree with me, because this is my opinion, so blast me if you wish to. I can take it.

As for Blade Runner 2049. Spoilers: 

There was the last scene when Joe tells Deckard to visit his daughter...? What happened to security? Since the main antagonists are out of the picture, there's suddenly no officials to protect assets?

As for whether or not I like this movie or not? I do. I found it fundamentally more enjoyable. The story was very engaging. I caught on quickly to the plot, though I was a bit off regarding who the offspring was. I'm not fully aware as to the director of this movie, but this person is far and away a much better director than the original's. I find so many aspects of most of Scott's movies rub me the wrong way.

So, Jeremy Jahns, here you have the anomaly. I really liked this sequel. Thank goodness Ridley wasn't in the filmmaker's chair!

For the life of me I cannot comprehend the fandom behind this or the original film (and I'm a hard sci-fi literature, film buff who loved The Arrival.)  Besides the obviously SPECTACULAR visuals neither film has much inner content. The ""high-art cinema"" or ""intellectual masterpiece"" statements sound ridiculous to my ear. The original film has a 5 minute setup in a way of 5 rogue ""military grade"" replicants who've escaped and need to be put down by Deckard. Everything from that point forward is hours of beautiful imagery and... nothing much else. By the end of the film I didn't know who Deckard is, what drives me. He was a guest popping into each scene and going off without any character defining actions. To say that his romance with Rachel felt abrupt is a huge understatement. Lastly, the ""military grade"" Roy's actions at the end of the film are mind-bending and confusing. Why would a killing machine get undressed, blast holes in the walls with his head, read an emotonal passage I, as an audience, have no emotional investment in and DIE?? Please someone enlighten me. What am I missing here? I love my visual storytelling with minimal spoon-feeding. But the original film or it's sequel (which had marginally more plot) hardly qualify as intellectual films.",none,,2021-03-08 16:19:52.124592,0

The problem with this movie is its too cerebral. Thats why only us armchair philosophers and those crazy enough to engage their brains actually like this second movie..Once again it asks the age old question: ""what does it mean to be human?""; which has been pursued not only by the first blade runner and this movie, but by both versions of ghost in the shell, and one other movie about a robot as well as a number of classic anime such as bubblegum crisis ( Priss and the Replicants anyone? )..  Hell, its a question we all ask in one form or another at some point in our lives ( what does it mean to be a man? for instance ). But what the original movie posed for questions, the sequel answers in its own way ( it doesnt matter ).  It also answers the biggest cliff hangar left by the original ( What happened after the unicorn? ) Somehow, we knew back then that Rachel could get pregnant. I dont know how we knew but we knew. Racxhel was special;. she had no time limit, and she was unique among replicants. This new movie lets us know right off, Decard wasnt a replicant ( no time limit ) and he had a kid ( after their flee from LA ).. The movies end was poetic perfection, bringing the Deckard saga to a fitting close ( he meets his replicant born daughter.  I think, as far as sequels go, there wont be any. Yeah true, i'd be dead before it came out but that not withstanding, no one wants one. It would be an insult to us and to Riddley Scott.

I am a guy that loves to think and detective/mystery stuff gets me hooked, and this movie definitely took a interesting turn for me. Now that I saw Blade Runner 2049, I want to see the original because it certainly feels like I was seeing and learning about a world that has been established. A part of me hopes for another Blade Runner film, maybe they can get a trilogy going and have a conclusion with what the first two movies left for the world.

I have not watched it yet but many of the complaints people have about this remind me of the original blade runner and I'm just going to have to say that this movie probably wasn't really meant to appeal to everyone. The old one went with a very particular theme which is why (apart from the theatrical release) it took a long time to be praised. It has boring scenes but most of them actually were very important points in the movie and I can tell from watching the original one twice that seeing all the clues that Deckard would find but not have the movie emphasise them was why I was so laser focused to the screen. I understand that a lot of people didn't like this movie but you don't need to be so obnoxious about it. Some people are really happy that studios actually took a chance with blade runner so let us enjoy it.,none,,2021-03-08 16:19:52.358290,0

The people behind this film clearly weren't motivated by what was going to generate the most profit, and instead were highly focused on creating something truly unique and immensely creative.  It's unfortunate it was an apparent box office flop, but I believe Blade Runner 2049 will be remembered for a great many years, while other so called box office smash hits we see every year will fade into obscurity over time.

On the first movie, there are a lot of trust in memories as a key aspect of the reality of existence. You think, then you are, but so the replicants... But humans have real memories, real past and connections, parents and relatives. Replicants are feed with fake memories, that anyone with the access of their registers could tell they are fake. In Blade Runner 2049 this division line, strongly defined in the first movie, is completely blurred in a very, very, intelligent way. That makes you question: what does really means the reality of existence? What does it means to have a, so called, soul? 
Only because of it, Blade Runner 2049 is worthwhile to exist as one of the best movies of this year, plus excellent cinematography and photography, makes a delight to the eyes.

Every scene had dramatically paced establishing shots, and I felt certain shots dragged out unnecessarily too long. And there were multiple scenes that have could have been cut entirely. 

Overall, a bit disappointed. But not so much that I won’t purchase the Blu-ray. However, I do hope it will be edited into a more meaningful cut.",none,,2021-03-08 16:19:52.551665,1

The original blade runner is possibly one of my favourite movies of all time, and that’s partly because of the fact it was open to interpretation and you could imagine what was going to happen next in your head. It didn’t need to be made. And I’m dreading the the next film after I saw them talk about an ‘uprising’.

This movie was also not very emotional at all compared to the original. (Spoilers...) There weren’t really any other replicants on the run (except for the main character nearer the end). And there was no moments of sadness like the monologue from Roy at the end.",none,,2021-03-08 16:19:52.551844,2

Ridley Scott ....This is how we pay the proper respect to classic films. You screwed ALIEN with that Gibberish of yours called PROMETHEUS. What a trash Film. Then Covenant..another shitty film !!   I hope from now on you learn how to make distinguishable films. 2049 is the perfect example how a movie should be made, no matter its a sequel ..prequel...etc...
Look at Blade Runner 2049 again...its eerie environment,its visual,the tone,colors,camera movement,details,lights,shades, narrative...score!!!..EVERYTHING IS PERFECT !! Dystopian to the Core. IT upgraded the first one to a whole new level without losing its magisty.
The experience i had while watching this film shall never be forgotten. I was immerse...bringing back old memories from the time when I watched the first one decades ago. I was all there but 1000 times better. My dreams came true.!!! I could die in piece now!!
Introducing new characters......narrative is simply fantastic..script rules.....the actors....my God !!! The actors....JOI is heart loving..amazing and type of woman that a man has always wanted to have.  Supportive,smart,kind,fair,sincere e allways by a man side.
HANS ZIMMER ....the king of all kings!! thank you and  Benjamin Wallfisch as well
Jahed? Fantastic
All those three girls!! Jesus! They are perfect !!!
And the DIRECTOR?  Doesnt Dennis ever make a terrible film? This guy is the new Kubrick. He is the most brilliant director of this generation!!!  YOU SAVED THIS FILM Dennis!!
Once Again WARNER...Spare This Blade Runner. The film is pg R and Its a not a film for everyone. U cannot except people who watch transformers and fast and furious to go to the cinema and watch a film of this caliber !!  Hope u guys can have your money back by lauching other films such as IT for example. Only 35 million dollars..and returner more than 600 million ! profit made !!
BLADE RUNNER IS THE MOST XPECTACULAR MOVIE of 2017. Forget about Star Wars. This is a kid blockbuster film..nothing more
BLADE RUNNER is the kind of film that makes you think,makes you move ahead,makes you go deep inside and provide you with interesting questions about AI, Humanity,real not real and Science. Moral Values...what life really means....What a soul really means.....endless possibilities...zillions of questions...I feel like the movie should never end...always asking for more.!!!

I realise that that's just the label you give your second highest rating, but to take it literally would be a problem. The pacing and length are justifiable for atmosphere, drama and giving you time to appreciate all the visuals and chew on the thought provoking questions. But it comes at the cost of rewatchability. Because you have plenty of time to take everything in on first viewing, on subsequent viewings when you know where everything is going, it will be difficult to sit through again and again.

I studied BR to death in high school and it ruined the movie for me. Cue the '98 game by Westwood Studios and I got pulled right into that world, amazing stuff. After that I went back and watched the film again and I loved it - because I was already invested in the world and because having studied it to death I was ready to appreciate what they were trying to do with it. So I think 2049 might connect with a new audience in ways that the original didn't, and some of that audience can go back to the original with a whole new appreciation of the world and the story - just like I did in 1998.",none,,2021-03-08 16:19:52.725798,0

I liked this slow burn movie a looot!  Darn well too long yes indeed.
The main complaints will be.. the audio balancing and the 'BWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA"" s. 
It wasn't the theater.. but the balance was just off, near the end of the movie, the SFX were just god awful loud then anyone talking is just so quiet. It was horrible when they did that.
Secondly and far worse for me.. the Bwahhhhs.  Dear lord. They had over 30+ scenes with bwaaahhs for the sake of  bwaaahs. Trying to be hyper dramatic or something? Every. Single. set up scene that I can remember had their own bwah. Flying over the city? Bwaah. seeing the lil hover drone shoot out towards the desert? Bwaah.  Opening of the movie? Bwaaah. They had a bwaah. then a shot of his apartment for maybe 3 mins. then another bwah. followed by the inside of the car... then another bwaaah right after that.
Just what the flying fuckery was going on with that?
Like everyone was making fun of it from that one inception movie and after that it became a funny thing to comment on.. but this one can't even make fun of. just soo many...

so yeah... the movie itself and content I all enjoyed but some random details just annoyed the hell out of me.

The cinematography and sound was amazing I'll give them that. But the plot and characters were very weak. There was no logic to the storyline, potholes big enough to drive an 18 wheel through. I wasn't disappointed, as I was never expecting much, I heard the rave reviews before had, but new most the critics same age as me, 30 something growing up with late 70s, 80s and early 90s cinema, where just viewing this mediocre flick with nostalgic eyes.

Ps Denis is one of my favourite directors at the moment. But unfortunately I think his hands were tired having RIDLEY Scott as producer.

Also everything was good but maybe too much. Everything was too much.
Even the Hans Zimmer Music Style was too much for too simple scenes, like it wanted you to feel a certain way about a shot and the Atmosphere for some sceneries was visually so strong like ""you should feel like this about this scene"".
And characters were too much for me too. Leto was also not really needed here and I enjoyed some small characters like the Somalian Dude much more then him.
Gosling was good but I couldn't connect with his distanced and seldomly emotional and reactive behavior. It may fit the newer replicants but compared to the old movie he nevers feel like he is in danger, because he is like Terminator in Terminator 2. The bad guy has become the good guy and will save the day against the Replicant Terminatrix.

Great ideas, philosophical questions about humanity and special effects are what makes Blade Runner important, but goodness gracious was this new one full of dull characters. The most lively character was Harrison Ford's. Ryan Gosling and Jared Leto are both phenomenal actors in my opinion, but they were both so crippled by their characters in this film. They didn't get the opportunity to showcase their talents in this one. The plot was also rather cut and dry.

The audio was completely out of place and sounded like a speaker was being unplugged (staticy). Ryan Gosling was awful, zero emotion. Granted he didn't play his usual smug/prick self that he usually does, but he really was just reading dialogue. But the worst part about this (outside of the 3 hr run time of boredom) is that it wants you to think that it is incredibly deep, thought provoking and artsy.

I was born in 1995 and even though I really liked the story and concept of the original Blade Runner movie, I just couldn't stand the aesthetics of it. The whole visual style just made me feel so uncomfortable while watching it (kind of similar to the movie ""Brasil"") that I couldn't enjoy it as a whole. That is to say I aknowledge, that it was a very groundbreaking movie that deserves the many fans it has, just for me personally it was not as enjoyable! 
Now Blade Runner 2049 brought the same qualities as described before just with a different, more modern visual style. So now that I could actually not only stand looking at it without feeling uncomfortable, but actually be amazed and stunned by the imigary, I was just blown away by this movie!

It's a dense and rich movie and you will catch small things upon second viewing that you missed the first time.)

If you saw and liked the original Blade Runner (any version), you'll definitely like this movie! If you like cerebral, thoughtful movies, you'll almost assuredly like this movie. If you don't mind movies like Solaris, 2001, Her, and even the original Star Trek movie, then you'll probably like this movie. But if none of those movies appeal to you, or you don't like deliberately slow-paced movies, or you prefer lots of action, or you can't sit still for 2.75 hours, then maybe you might not like it.

Personally, the original is one of my all-time faves, and, after watching the new movie twice in two days, I'm simultaneously both more impressed than before and more critical than after the first viewing. I dare say that I enjoyed it more than before. I especially like the first half, before he meets Deckard. Up until that point, it's nearly perfect.

I must be contrarian and say that I am underwhelmed with the score. It's either unobtrusive ambient synth, or a nearly (and at times exactly) direct copy of the Vangelis original (especially the ""Tears in Rain"" ending), or over-the-top blown-out bass which sounds like an airplane landing. And I still feel like the super loud parts were overdone, especially in scenes that didn't seem to call for it.

Now for the nitpicks:

--> When K first thought he might be human, why didn't he use that device to check his eye for a serial number?

--> After failing the baseline test, he was told he had 48 hours. So why didn't he know that the LAPD would be able to follow him? It's never revealed if they have tracking devices implanted into them or not, but he at least should have ditched his police-issue car.

--> Why didn't JOI see the prostitute replicant place the tracking device in his coat? (Was she turned off? Why? We hear the chime later, but never see him turn her on.) The assumption is she always watching, just like when she knew that K hadn't told the police chief about the birthdate from his memory.

--> Why did Wallace have to send Deckard ""off world"" in order to torture him? You mean he doesn't have everything he needs on Earth, where he is and where he makes the new replicants?

--> How was K even able to track Love when she was transporting Deckard off world?

--> Why didn't K kill Deckard? I had thought he would side with the replicant rebellion. (Maybe he still felt a bit like Deckard was his ""father"" even after he realized that it wasn't true, but still...)

--> Why would they think that everyone will assume Deckard drowned? Come on. Wouldn't it be more logical to assume that Wallace would not be satisfied until he found a body...? Surely they have the technology to find it.

--> I don't think K should have died from his knife injuries. Yes, it was a vicious wound, but look at all he did AFTER receiving the injury. Also, they made it clear earlier in the movie that replicants are tough and can handle injuries that would likely kill a normal human.

--> Love is a cool villain, but she was still a bit too one-dimensional. Personally, I would have liked to have seen more depth and more ambiguity, (much like Roy Baty from the original where he saves Deckard at the end so he has someone to watch him die).

IMO, I didn't like K's ""apparent"" death - too much trying to mirror the Roy Baty death scene. If anything, I think it would have been more poetic and made more sense for Deckard to have died. K should have lived to join and become a leader of the upcoming replicant rebellion (which would make a great topic for the next movie, BTW).

Yet, all of this being said, I still think I liked it even more after the second viewing, especially the first half/two-thirds. The longer the movie goes, the more convoluted it becomes and the more the thread unravels.

It's still a great movie! But that doesn't mean that it doesn't have flaws. It could have been even better... Nevertheless, I'd still give it a 9/10.",none,,2021-03-08 16:19:53.163502,0

I will say, this movie felt just like the original - but it improved on everything to such a large degree, that it made me understand why others could have seen the original as a masterpiece. If I had watched the original in the early 80's, perhaps it would have had the same impression on me. As someone who didn't see it until 5 years ago, I honestly couldn't understand why it was such a cult classic.

But it's not just about the improvements on technology either. To be clear, even the way they explored the question of ""what makes someone human?"" was far more fascinating and emotionally compelling here then in the original.",none,,2021-03-08 16:19:53.361343,0

As for Blade Runner 2049...I was a little disappointed. Lets go over the positives first. This movie is stunning and beautiful to look at, the cinematography is brilliant! It's truthfully mind blowing and almost worth the price of admission alone. This movie also had a lot of interesting Sci Fi elements that are new and innovative, like Ryan Gosling's holographic girlfriend. I've never seen anything quite like it, it was pretty cool. The actors were all very strong in their performances, so much so that it left me wanting more from certain characters. I really enjoyed Jared Leto's performance, he's pulls off an especially creepy and mysterious character. I wanted more Leto to be honest.
Negatives
This film is slooooooooowwww and too long! And I love slow movies usually! They unnecessarily stretch scenes out to the point where you're bored....and as a BIG Blade Runner fan it pains me to say that! I'm upset actually that l felt this way about this movie. The movie has pacing issues for sure. I also found the main plot of the story a little thin, it wasn't hard to get lost in this movie and wonder where are they going with this? They tried to throw a twist in, but truthfully when the twist is unraveled or revealed I didn't care, it was underwhelming. For a movie being 2 hrs 40 mins l actually expected more out of it. Certain scenes were too long and drawn out, and other parts were sorrily lacking depth. The original Blade Runner story is way better in my opinion. Also Harrison Ford doesn't even show up until the last 40 mins and by the end of movie I thought to myself, ""did they even really need him?"" Overall the movie is OK, which again sucks for me to say, because if the pacing and story was a little bit stronger and things flowed a bit better this movie could have easily been a 10/10 for Sci Fi. To sum it all up it's a good movie with some extraordinary visuals and very cool Sci Fi technology/elements and the acting is strong, but has serious pacing problems, it's too long and the story is average. LOL the first Blade Runner has a faster pace! So to all those people who thought the first one was slow, don't even bother with this one. I would definitely watch Blade Runner 2049 again as I feel I could definitely learn new things and l want to see if my opinion changes to a more positive one. Overall my rating is a 7/10.....barely.",none,,2021-03-08 16:19:53.361713,0

As said in your review it asks similar questions part 1 already did but it was done more subtle all around and less ""explainy"" in your face than here.

Part 1 had a simple setup. ""Here are some bad replicants search and take em out"" and became a movie where it asked and presented many things from the viewer to think about in a very subtle way.
Felt here it wanted to shove it in your face it had no subtlety.

There was however an interesting hook with the ""digital being"" and I wish the movie explored that more/further instead of answering stuff from 1 which could have been just left alone.
""Flesh life"" of part 1 versus ""digital life"" in part 2 ..again sad it wasnt explored further.

In the end I found it forgetful, slow and bloated. 

Also please stop with screaming antagonists when they are angry it feels so childish and cartoony.
(Also boss police woman badly acted)

The movie is a perfect sequel, and still a movie on its own. For me it is an instant classic.

But I thought the original was a lot better, particularly the final cut. I need to see 2049 again to make a final judgment, but I think the atmosphere, motivations and pacing were all better in the first movie. The villian's were better too, and the score was a lot more memorable.  

2049 has a better main character arc, and the cinematography is amazing. But I felt several steps ahead of the movie, like I was waiting for inevitable events to play out without much of it surprising me. Im not trying to be down on the movie but I think recency bias might be playing a part.

Also, I've seen several scenes and themes in 2049 done in other recent sci for movies. Namely Her. Children of Men and Ex Machina. There are moments that seem directly.... influenced 
..by moments in those movies.

This movie was a bloated turd. Aimless and meandering lacking any of the depth of the original. It has nothing to say and a cliche filled plot with unearned moments that make me lament the state of modern film making.
This film is a perfect example of the nature of the society in which we live. Surface level beauty wrapped around a hollow story. Very clearly this movie lacked a script when shooting....

Every scene in the original the lighting was always moving, floodlights in the background, reflection, flickering lights, here it's just a plain lit room which looked boring, so uninspired, felt like a hospital room with sterile lighting, lacked shadows and contrast. I was disappointed in that area. That's the number one thing that makes a blade runner movie and there was only one standout scene with dynamic lighting and it used water reflected lighting like original. I was watching Gosling in his kitchen and just wishing a light would flicker or something to make it feel dirty and gritty, it was so clean and sterile. If they fixed that one major thing that makes even the most boring scene interesting, like original, remember the scan and enhance scene in original, it's sorta boring but the atmosphere and lighting makes the scene so dynamic, it's like art, this was too generic basic sci-fi lighting in too many scenes.

Compare this original glorious looking scene: https://youtu.be/NoAzpa1x7jU

With this bland looking scene here that just looks flat which is how a lot of the movie looks except in bursts of dynamic visuals: https://youtu.be/lAH8OrwM7Bs

But movies do not need to be fast-paced all the time.  I know that if 2001:  A Space Odyssey and Blade Runner was released now without its reputation, it would be considered long and boring.  Remember movies prior to 1977 used to be at that pace.  People did not like Blade Runner in 1982 because they were expecting another Star Wars. 
 The great Sci-Fi and fantasy films prior to Star Wars was never considered long and boring.  Today's audiences need to get off the fast food world of movies and get back to the fundamentals.  You'll enjoy Blade Runner better if you change your mindset.  Like Yoda said, ""You must unlearn what you have learned.""",none,,2021-03-08 16:19:54.214727,0

News flash: NO ONE IS PUTTING SOULS INTO THEIR HARDWARE.  It's 2017, and we STILL don't have robots that can think outside their programming.  Sometimes their programs let them MIMIC emotions, but they're ultimately just doing what we told them to do.  Scientists want to make machines that benefit mankind, not machines that that try to have their own lives.

But of course Hollywood doesn't know that, because they're all about getting emotional reactions out of us, rather than trying to get us to think rationally.  It's easier to appeal to emotions than logic.

Obviously those 2 were not on the shuttle. There were other things but overall I liked the movie. The book was completely different so you cant compare the two.

I was really into it for the first 10 minutes or so, and then it went downhill from there. Nothing about the environment in the movie makes sense. What is the purpose of the lie detector test if every replicant is registered to a list? Why not just pull up the list? Why waste time with setting up an irrelevant plot element? That, and one of the complaints I had about The Force Awakens applies to this film as well. In TFA, I don't see Han Solo, I see Harrison Ford. He is so tired, exhausted, and simply does not care about being on that set, and it shows in his performance. The same applies here. I don't see Deckard, I see Harrison Ford. His chemistry with Sean Young is non-existent, and it irreparably damages all interactions they have in the film. And...was that scene with the dove really necessary? It screams of a pretentious college film student wanting to be taken seriously. Ridley Scott can do good work, but the first Blade Runner is horribly paced, stumbles all over its concepts, and achieves nothing significant.

Lots of films become cult films, and lots of films are studied as a part of film history. That doesn't make them good. All that means is that a small number of people really liked it, and put it on a phatom pedestal as though it achieved some monumental milestone. I appreciate the review, but it just sounds like more of the same. So, no, not a fan of the original, so I probably won't be a fan of this.

I watched it on VHS, I recorded the soundtrack off the TV with my radio/cassette player (because Vangelis didn't release it and they did this orchestral version that was OK, but not). Then a few years later they came out with the director's cut. OMG, I thought I had died and gone to movie heaven. No more stupid ending, no more voice overs. The part where Roy gives his speech and the dove flies off didn't have Ford's explanation of the ending like we were all a bunch of idiots who couldn't figure it out for ourselves. Fantastic.

The movie felt like a large collection of scenes that didn't add up to anything but re-hashing some material from the original and setting up Blade Runner 2069 or whatever the sequel will be called. I am sure most video game plots aren't nearly as thin as this.

I was bored at several times throughout. The highlight and only suspense in the entire movie was scene late in the movie that took place in the ocean. This makes 4 of the last 5 movies from the director where children are at the center of the plot. I suppose that was supposed to be the shocking reveal in this movie but it just shows this director or his writers are looking for cheap, unimaginative plot elements that critics and sheep googoo and gaga for.

Just re-watched the original 2 days ago and this one pales in comparison, being almost 40 years newer, the visual effects were really nothing spectacular. Not a terrible movie but definitely NOT a great movie by any means, I would argue that those who praise this movie have very very low expectations.",none,,2021-03-08 16:19:54.633140,0

That's mainly because the first film has existed for around three and a half decades. If someone watched it a long time ago and hated it they might not have watched it again. So many revivals of classic franchises have just been fun popcorn movies without any real depth so I wouldn't blame the people who didn't like Blade Runner for being interested in 2049 because they think it'll be the same. So yeah some people are going hate it because it's in the same vein as the original but I think a lot are going to love it because their tastes have changed and they just didn't realize Blade Runner falls into the things they like now. Anyway all that said hopefully this movie will make a lot of Blade Runner/Do Android's Dream Of Electric Sheep? fans whether or not they've watched or read it before.,none,,2021-03-08 16:19:55.048427,0

For me it was just so slow, dull and the plot just kind of meanders along until it gets to important bits.
I never saw what was so good about Captain Monologue.

To put it in to a single word to me the film is ""Pretentious"" more than it is a good movie, it's certainly a damn cool sci-fi world and I can see why it's influential but the film itself and the story...I can definitely live without it.


After watching it all I could think was ""Well that was a huge waste of time""

Male sex workers have to market themselves to gay men because they don't get enough business appealing just to women.

You recommending the theatrical cut tells me that you disrespect the original movie and this one and understand them quite differently than I and Scott/Villeneuve do. The noir angle was just tagged onto this type of movie, because the studio exec's in the 80's thought it wouldnt sell as a full cyberpunk narrative, which they were probably right about. But both films are so much more if you disregard that arc and just see it as a world with philosophical dilemmas and questions it searches answers to, but doesnt always find. The concept of existential dread and false hope was a large theme in 2049 and I feel it encapsulated those emotions quite well and the sad answer is, there is almost never a happy ending and not shying away from that makes this movie unique.",none,,2021-03-08 16:19:55.808034,2

Where to begin? In my opinion this is the sequel any Blade Runner fan could hope to see. I don’t love it as much as the original, but it’s still very good and in no way diminishes the quality if the first one. The objectification you talked about for me fit into the world that was designed perfectly. It’s not a nice world where everything is perfect, it’s a nasty and dirty one where people (not only those of the synthetic kind) are treated and behave badly. The likable characters are likable because the world they inhabit is even worse... The way certain women are presented fits in perfectly especially because there is also the great portrayals of “Luv” and the police captain as very distinctly different female characters. I thoroughly enjoyed the scenes with “Joi” both in performance as well as her physical attractiveness. I don’t necessarily think it’s the intention at all to identify with the humans in this film as you seem to believe. I think you are triggered to identity and sympathize with both sides as the question the film asks us is what makes a human human in the first place? I get the reason why you made a point of objectification and I too would have enjoyed seeing at least a bit of male objectification stuck in there for good measure, but I think the general idea here is that women will not go for just any man, so men are forced to get their thrills elsewhere. Funny how you didn’t object to child exploitation and slavery. Actually it’s not weird, it just fits in the world that is set and so does the way some women are portrayed.",none,,2021-03-08 16:19:56.286480,0

Victimizing a whole group on one perception. You said that you loved the concept of individualism but then generalize that all women and blacks are made to feel this or that because you do. Women in the industry I can sort of see depending on which type of woman is watching. Sex sells no matter the race or religion. Women tend to be perceived more as innocent and pure by a multitude of different types of stories, so I can see where your coming from even though it doesn't bother me in the slightest. But I can't see why you had to bring up blacks. First, What about ever other minority group? If we're going to call out groups we need to include everyone that falls into the ""perceived oppressed"" category. Secondly what does Hollywood do to make blacks feel bad? Not hire them for deeper roles enough? Over use black stereotype? The same could be said for conservatives in film (as proven by kingsmans 2, all made to feel like hillbillies and murderers). The same could be said about native Americans and Mexicans, always playing the same type of role. I mean Tyler Perry makes a living on satire and he's a popular black creator who plays on his own races stereotypes to sell tickets. Which continues to grow in popularity in the black community. So if it's made to make them feel bad, then why are blacks watching Perry's films or blockbuster films such star wars and blade runner. Maybe Hollywood just wants to make money (as we seen with the cheap, unoriginal films that keep popping out) and are trying to appeal to the larger demographic so they can sell more tickets. Over half of America's population is white versus a little of 13% are black. Hollywood is all about how to make more money so this concept isn't out of the realm of possible conclusions.",none,,2021-03-08 16:19:56.730654,0

It is fiction, after all. To suggest that using objectification in fiction is going to influence or ultimately lead to the audience changing their views towards dehumanization, after having indulged, is actually intellectually discrediting. Think about it. If you're rational enough, logical enough and reasonable enough, then no amount of exposure to 'dehumanizing' fiction is going to alter your reality in a negative way and major intellectual points to those who demonstrate as much (basically most people since the dawn of storytelling having been created).

Yet trying to change fiction you don't enjoy is the equivalent of trying to build a pseudo-wall to protect you - which in essence is precisely why you'll rightly be labeled as weak-minded.

Why does a movie always have to end on a high note? I can give you a list of great movies that didn't end on a high note and they are considered classics.  Take for instance, Star Trek the Wrath of Kahn. They killed off Spock. If wasn't not a downer, I don't know what was. Also, to touch a bit on individuality, Spock's own ideology is that the good of the many outweigh the needs of the few. Then you have Star Wars The Empire Strikes back which ends on a low note. Han gets iced and Luke loses his hand and light saber. Not to mention that Luke finds out his father is Vader.  All pretty depressing for an ending (I shudder every time I think about the happy ending of Return of the Jedi). But we all enjoyed those movies downer endings and all.  Bottom line is the context of the movie should determine the ending. It should not be forced to be upbeat or downbeat.  People will see through that. I know I would spot it a mile away.  If the context of the movie calls for a downer of an ending then that's what it should be and vice versa.

As far as the objectification of women (replicants) i think it makes perfect sense that most replicant sex workers would be female in the same way that in our present most sex workers and sex dolls are female. Also keep in mind Blade Runner is a product of 1980s/1930s so going all cutting edge might not fit the retro style of the film, remember this is noir not neo.

I also feel that sacrificing oneself for other is the natural step after finding one's self worth, it's also something that is explored in Blade Runner 2022 Blackout. I think sacrifice gives a story a grander theme and self worth is more intimate smaller in theme.

Lastly love complexity and hate dumbed down movies of today. I don't need anymore films that spoon feed me a storyline. I watch ""Your Name"" recentlly an the cleverness of that movie shits all Hollywood movies. I love the fact that I needed to watch a couple of YouTube video to get explanations of story/cultural elements that just went right over my head. A good film is one that need to be watched multiple times and gets better with every viewing.

To me the the main flaw of the original Blade Runner was that the overall storyline was just too damn simple with a lot of cool stuff was never shown because it happened before the movie even started ( I think because of budget reasons). But Hollywood has a long history of putting simple stories in complicated worlds and I think it is the dumbest thing ever. You should have a complicated story in a complicated world, otherwise it's just a waste of potential. So bring it on Blade Runner 2049!",none,,2021-03-08 16:19:56.731656,6

I feel like he's done the rise and fall of a gangster twice already with Goodfellas and Casino and not only was he doing the same thing again but doing it yet again with Pesci and De Niro, I just felt like I'd been there before too many times. The de-aging didn't work for me either, the faces were mostly OK but the necks looked weird and the bodies moved like old men. Pesci and De Niro were excellent as old men however, I think the movie would have worked a lot better had he cast younger actors for the younger roles and kept those guys for the old roles, there wouldn't have been any de-aging weirdness and you would have had fresh faces for most of the story to avoid 'gangster fatigue'",none,,2021-02-20 17:55:51.451114,1

Omg it is so boring. It got kind of exciting around the 2 hour mark but got boring again around 2 hr 45 mins. Any time Pacino was on screen he was great. I see now why Deniro didn’t get an Oscar nom now and it’s because he wasn’t that great. Pacino and Pesci were great and I agree with their noms. There is SO much in this movie that doesn’t even add anything to the story at all. I raised my hands up 2 or 3 times and said to myself wtf did that add?! The de-aging was horrible. It took me out of it all throughout. When Pesci kept calling Deniro “kid” I was like you gotta be kidding me. Y’all look the same age as each other through the whole movie. There’s one shot where the camera was really close to Deniro’s face and he looked super young and that was a shot where he was supposed to be older. I didn’t even know what was going on half the time and not in a good way and also who tf is going to remember all the characters that are introduced? I was very very disappointed with this movie.

*** POSSIBLE SPOILERS ***
What makes The Irishman great is Frank Sheeran's lonelyness at the end. He gave so much to his mob life and time went by and he lost his family. 

Most of the Scorsese crime movies end with a rampage of violence, and headshots and blood until there's one last character standing. (Mark Whalberg in The Departed, De Niro's character in Cassino and Taxi Driver for instance). Here in The Irishman we see De Niro being the last man standing while ""life"" takes care of most of guys he knew. 

That loneliness vibe at the end though.... Jesus, Scorsese...",none,,2021-02-20 17:55:51.749435,0

I honestly can’t believe it’s a Scorsese film.  And the themes were so banal and trite and worse that you don’t even understand the theme until the very end of the film.  I think the failure of the theme landing falls on the script, De Niro, and Scorsese.  

We’re supposed to be moved when the guy’s family deserts him and let’s him basically die alone?  But there is no build up to this other than the one daughter who suspects him of killing her favorite creepy uncle Hoffa.  This is also morally dubious.  She obviously doesn’t care about the gangster lifestyle; she loved Hoff.

They don’t adequately illustrate the moments where he is choosing whatever it is over his family.  And I say ‘whatever it is’ because is it friendship or is it the rush of being a killer or is it money or is it power?  

Poor writing, poor acting, and poor directing.  A good story doesn’t drop the theme on you in the end, but that doesn’t mean it has to be obvious.  It’s just when the story comes together, it becomes clear.  What isn’t clear is the myriad of useless scenes that don’t seem to advance the plot in any conceivable fashion.",none,,2021-02-20 17:55:52.063259,0

Beyond just the physical look, they act as old men. You see a 40-year-old hitman move like an 80-year-old man. and even though there are shots where the de-aging works, in isolation, it looks like deniro has 3 or 4 different younger faces, sometimes in the same scene.

Chris Stuckmann has a discerning eye -- he is able to deconstruct the elements of a film that make it special and sensitize us to them without spoiling the experience of watching it for the first time. 


In this case the magic is in the legendary pairing of Scorcese and his New York criminal characters as played by Dr Niro, Pesci, Keitel, as well as a first for Scorcese,  Al Pacino. I agree with the reviewer: it works, magnificently. We are presented with a portrayal of once-violent men in their contemplative years, faced with the consequences of their past. I know it sounds boring but it's not because we come to care so much about the characters. 


The de-aging process, once we've acknowledged it's at work, does not call attention to itself -- we accept the characters' appearance at earlier stages of their lives more readily than makeup could do because this digital process is almost seamless. Expect to see a lot more of this process in the future.


If you have a Netflix account, there's a video interview available where the movie's principals discuss the project and their challenges. But I recommend that before you see it you watch the movie. Thanks to Netflix, this can be done on your home theater system. If you're like me, you don't miss the typical movie theater, with its filth, high prices, noisy audiences, and the distraction of multiple cell phone screens. I waited to watch this film on my big Sony at 4K, which produces a better picture than any cineplex projector can. Especially with a 3.5 hour film, it's nice to be able to pause the playback once in a while. Happy viewing and enjoy!",none,,2021-02-20 17:55:52.063647,0

I would like to focus, however, on Joe Pesci. I have never been so emotionally moved by a performance in at least the past 10 years. I think it's due to his volatile behavior that we have come to expect in his prior Scorsese films. Only this time, he has moved to the top and wields the ultimate power he was never able to achieve in Goodfellas and Casino. But, now he's older, wiser, restrained... and sad. For all of his power and success, all he could focus on was to be loved and it tore him apart when Peggy Sheeran wouldn't reciprocate that love and respect. This is a movie about sadness and regret. Where did it get them? Convictions, dying in jail and estrangement from what really matters:  family. I loved this film, but I was incredibly sad and devastated at the end. Like the end of an era that I never wanted to end. Hell, even the violence and the size of the guns were smaller and more restrained. All in the backdrop of a changing era, with the death of Kennedy squarely in the background. It was a film about death, sorrow, regret and change, which is inevitable. Scorsese seemed to be passing the torch to the next generation in hopes that something better might emerge. The final scene with DeNiro is gut-wrenching and I will carry that forever. I still feel it in the pit of my stomach and I've never been as upset by a film until now. A stunning achievement so well done, that I almost wish it wasn't.",none,,2021-02-20 17:55:52.441183,0

I watched it a few days ago, before I knew you had reviewed it. I'll rethink my opinion of the movie based on your review.  I found the movie to be very very long, and rather pointless. It seemed like a vehicle in which to promote these old actors. I kept waiting for something to mean something, but I was not rewarded with anything of the kind. It just seemed like we meander through the day of a man who had no backbone, a Yes Man, a man who doesn't have a mind of his own, a man with no scruples. And like, are  we supposed to admire and root for this man, this ""Irishman""? The only person I rooted for (and I knew it was pointless) was Jimmy Hoffa, a man who had a backbone.     I didn't like the man that DeNiro played. I didn't respect him, and frankly, I was off put by the feeling he was the person we should root for. Anyway, I might watch it again. Maybe not. As I think back on it, what's the point? There is no point to this movie except to watch great old time actors strut their stuff in yet another movie about The Mob. Parasites who do nothing creative, who ""earn"" off the backs of hard working man, that they coerce money from. The Sopranos shed light on this parasitism. The Soprano family lived in luxury, paid for by hard working common men that they rob and steal from. Anyway, enough ranting.",none,,2021-02-20 17:55:52.441455,0

When given free reign, Scorsese picks the most mundane and boring subject matter he could possibly make, Labor Union.

Ray Romano was very good as the lawyer.  The problem with this movie besides Pacino, the ""guys"" are old.  I tried to look the other way and try to by-in, but it is difficult to do.  In this one scene when DeNiro's character beat up a shopkeeper for touching his daughter, DeNiro could barely move and it wasn't believable.  I love DeNiro but he looked stiff (much more stiff than usual) because he is old.  Pesci is another guy I love, but he is so old for this part, sorry.   Harvey Keitel barely was in the movie and I do not believe he stood, because I don't think he can.  Also,  Anna Packwood as noted by Chris is a very good actress who has been in some great movies and tv shows and was way underutilized, which is very disappointing.  The depiction of how screwed up the USA was back in 50s, 60s and 70s was excellent and makes this time don't feel so bad.  I give it a C+.

I only dissagree about you said about Anna Paquin's character. 


(kinda spoiler: ) It was surely deliberate decision that she did not get too much screen time. Her absence is crucial to the story. I even enjoyed the decision of casting of the actress (she has an oscar) for a relatively small part. It was felt like a meta-joke by Scorsese... Well,  until ""that"" point. I even loved Anna Paquin's acting.",none,,2021-02-20 17:55:53.084550,0

Pachino is the only actor with a real performance.

I was really excited about it because I’m a big Scorsese fan, as many people are, and also the actors in it are great. Scorsese is one of those Directors who doesn’t make too many bad movies. Now that I’m older I see the issues, but gangs of New York was one of my favorite movies at the time. If it had just changed a couple of things it could’ve been great. Anyways he has had a couple of fairly bad movies but nothing awful that I can think of or that I’ve seen except for maybe boxcar Betty or whatever it’s called but that’s one of his first movie so I’ll give him a pass. The only directors who I can think of you have had an almost flawless Resume is Tarantino but he’s only made like eight so not sure if he can be counted. So, going in I knew this was going to be a good movie because we know Scorsese can make a good mob movie. Joe Pesci was willing to come out of retirement for it so that was exciting. It never felt as long as it was. A lot of movies that are like Lord of the rings can’t feel too long but this one kept you interested even when there wasn’t killing going on. I try not to take off too much for the aging thing but I honestly never believed deniro Was supposed to be young. I honestly don’t know anyway for them to fix this in  movies Because using CGI just looks silly and just using make up and changing their clothing doesn’t always work too well but once again whatever they did didn’t feel over the time. Anyways, I will give this movie a solid a as well And think it was worth the wait because I remember hearing about it a while back. It seems like there are always good mob movies out there but I can see this one being listed in the top 10 maybe even higher",none,,2021-02-20 17:55:53.383009,0

All of three of these guys amaze me in this movie because they reinvented themselves within the same movie genre that made them famous.


 But Scorsese made some choices that puzzle me a little, and I'm going to have to watch the movie again to see if I'm over analyzing a few things. Did anyone else think that this movie is real meta?

People just like it, because it has the Scorsese brand slapped on it, much in the same way people automatically love a Starwars movie because it says starwars on the front ...even though Return of the Jedi was the last decent movie that was made within that franchise

Anyway 5 minutes in,  you are confronted with 3 time-jumps and the most boring opening scenes in the history of Cinema some digital de-aging mess that immediately takes you out of it and makes you feel as if you're looking at a CG cutscene in a game ... uncanny valley.
Later on de Niro does some enforcing to some guy at a bakery because he shoved his kid ...and it is painstakingly clear that it is frail 80 year old guy doing the enforcing with a digital de-aged head pasted on the body ...


And the story never got of the ground and in the end after I saw an 80 year old pretending to be someone in his late 30's and not being able to pull it off I hit pause ...looked at the insane run time and said :""forget about it"" .

Honestly just re-watch Casino, Goodfellas, The Godfather, Scarface, Sopranos ...heck even that ridiculous Gotti movie with John Travolta was better than this crap... 

And people saying Scorsese is right about Superhero movies need to get their head out of their ass ... yes most of them are mediocre at best ... but I watch the the Dark Knight, Thor Ragnarok and the First Guardians of the Galaxy over this hot mess any day... 


Also Scorsese probably said it because he doesn't really understand  the appeal of a superhero movie, he only understand mob culture of the 50's, 60's and 70's ..because that's where he grew up in and after 40 years of making movies in that genre doesn't know anything else anymore ... what's your excuse besides copying a renowned filmmaker's opinion to sound smart",none,,2021-02-20 17:55:53.688214,0

The first 45 could have been trimmed a little. The last 45 would have been better if they would have given Paquin a bigger role.

I stuck it out for an hour just from respect of the cast and director whose works I have followed for since Mean Streets.

Think you overlooked the scenes where young Peggy is watching her father when certain news is on in the background or there is a newspaper article. I think she works out who her dad really is, and resents that Pesci’s character is behind it. To me, this is the most subtle form of character development I’ve seen and says a lot about Frank towards the end of the movie. Perhaps a cute moment of father and daughter early on might have served as a comparison of where the relationship started, but this would probably have been criticized as being too soppy or overtly flagging what is to come.

The mastery of Zallian and Scorsese perfectly utilize her character so efficiently that it maximizes her significance. She has one line but that one line probably has the BIGGEST/MOST affect on Frank's life. Further her relationship with Hoffa and lack of one with Russell only increases her importance to her father and us the audience. It truly is something to behold a director can take a character that has one line, strategically place her in a couple of scenes and yet make her impact so significant that it affects the protagonist more than anything else.",none,,2021-02-20 17:55:54.268486,0

This is not a good movie the storytelling is not there the film picks up in the 3rd act but the 1st and 2nd were boring and unimaginative. Scorsece does what he always does in gangster films it has nothing new and he should be kissing Netflix ass until he die because they were stupid enough to give 160 million for this movie, every other studio passed on it and it wasn't a mistake. 
The digital deaging is just wrong you can't tell and they don't specify what age they are when you see them on the movie because they know that in a scene where deniro is supposedly 35 he is looking like 50. 
The story isn't for the big screen and especially for a 3.5 hour movie nobody cares what happens to Hoffa in 2019 nobody outside of the US cares about Hoffa if you watch a 10 minute video on YouTube about what happened to him you can skip the movie because it has nothing to offer.
In conclusion Martin Scorsese does what he has done before it is not in the same level as Goodfellas or taxi driver or even wolf if wall street Pacino and deniro as great actors as they are they don't have the material to elevate the performance the stand out of the film I think Joe pesci he brings the evil in his calm eyes.",none,,2021-02-20 17:55:54.268525,0

Would have enjoyed it better watching it at home. Should have been a mini-series. Too long for it's own good, because it lacks a proper drive. Yet too short, because you only get 3 or 4 somewhat developed characters. Good job with the special effects, but I wish DeNiro's character would have tried to vary with facial expressions - it was like watching an Easter Island statue. And you have Anna Paquin and Jesse Plemons doing nothing at all. These are talented people being almost extras here.

Scorsese has been so inconsistent in quality to me, ever since Goodfellas, too many times has he delved into similar themes like Deja Vu retreading.

During the 1st part, it's when mob bosses RUSS BUFALINO and ANGELO BRUNO tell hitman FRANK SHEERAN (the title character) that he's in the middle of a betrayal plan without him knowing about it. During the 2nd part, it's when labor union leader JIMMY HOFFA and mob captain ANTHONY ""TONY PRO"" PROVENZANO start arguing about the latter not arriving to their meeting on time, which escalates until issues from the past are brought up. The thing is that these scenes are more personal. Even if the topic of discussion is something trivial (like whether or not traffic is a valid excuse for being late), it's compelling because of how much it means to the characters. Most of the movie unfortunately consists of talking from a business point of view. Of course that the characters are invested in what they're saying, but the stakes are different. It's not bad per se, but a more human approach would've helped the 210 minutes pass by a lot faster. During the 3rd part, the tone completely changes, and the number of great scenes increases. The pop songs and the over-realiance on narration are put aside (there's not even a lot of music score anymore either), which is more impactful. The de-aging effects are great, but it's hard to praise Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography. For the most part, the use of lighting and colors is pretty standard. Only 1/3 of the time he uses wide shots, crane shots and tracking shots. As I said before, the running time is mainly dedicated to conversations, and they're mostly filmed through close-ups and medium shots and edited with the shot-reverse-shot technique. I get that PEGGY SHEERAN (FRANK's daughter) only talking briefly in one scene (as an adult, at least) was done on purpose to make her words stick with the viewer more. I get that a good actress was still required in order to convey her thoughts without speaking. However, she doesn't get that many ""dramatically silent"" moments. She's practically an extra who happens to be in the center of the shot at times. I'm saying this because it was a good opportunity to cast an unknown actress and so she could have her big break. Using a famous and experienced actress like Anna Paquin felt like a waste. Was Al Pacino method-acting to the point where he was afraid he would disappear like his character did in real life? That would explain why he overacts like there's no tomorrow. Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci's performances are good. An advice to new directors out there: Using slow motion has to have a true purpose beyond being just a stylistic choice. It must highlight the intensity of the scene (dramatically or comedically) and help the audience pay attention to something that would be easy to miss otherwise. A bride and his father walking down the aisle with nothing else going on? Not needed. Especially if she's portrayed only as the daughter of a supporting character (I'm pretty sure we don't even find out what her name is).

I was nervous that it would simply be a futile attempt to try and grab something special from the Goodfellas and Casino days with actors that are too old to pull it off.  But I guess with the de-aging technology and the talent from these actors they pulled it off.  On a personal note, I went to the movies the other day and seen Midway.  It was OK I guess.  I kind of wish it would of been a little more Steven Spielberg-ish and less Michael Bay-ish.  But it was OK.  What wasn't OK at all was the movie going experience....I spent 16 freaking dollars on a large drink and a regular size popcorn........SIXTEEN BUCKS!!!    Are you fucking kidding me with that shit???!!!    WTH!!!   Why the hell are we letting theaters screw us in the ass?!  How is this price gouging not being called out??  I will never go to another movie theater, as long as they continue to rip us off.  They have beautiful big screen TV's at home now that will work just fine for me.  I can get my own large drink and large popcorn at home and still have plenty money left over to get dinner later.

Sadly not in my city. And it is to far to travel. So i have to wait for the Netflix release.
I agree *Martin Scorsese* is the most consistent in making great movies. But even he did made movies i didn't like let's say this century from 2000-2019. Shutter Island, The Departed ( the orginal Hong Kong movie ""Internal Affairs"" is way better), The Wolf of Wallstreet ( starts great but halfway through the movie it's getting boring).
Movies i liked were: Gangs of New York, Silence, Hugo and the Aviator.
*Steven Spielberg* is still close on 2nd place. Likes: A.I., Minority Report, Catch Me if You Can, War of the Worlds, Munich, Lincoln, Bridge of Spies. 
Mixed feelings: Ready Player One, Indiana Jones Crystal Skull, The BFG. 
Dislikes: The Post, War Horse, The Adventure of Tintin, The Terminal.
*Brain de Palma* only made shit movies in that period. Tho ""The Black Dahlia"" was okay but still disappointed with what he did. Same applies for *Francis Ford Coppola* . What happend to him? Is he tired? Or depressed? Or is it arrogance? Or just old?
I don't see *George Lucas* as a great director. But more as a writer and producer. Only the orginal Star Wars trilogy was great. But i dislike the prequel trilogy of Star Wars (1999-2005).",none,,2021-02-20 17:55:56.388530,0

Omg it is so boring. It got kind of exciting around the 2 hour mark but got boring again around 2 hr 45 mins. Any time Pacino was on screen he was great. I see why Deniro didn’t get an Oscar nom now and it’s because he wasn’t that great. Pacino and Pesci were great and I agree with their noms. There is SO much in this movie that doesn’t even add anything to the story at all. I raised my hands up 2 or 3 times and said to myself wtf did that add?! The de-aging was horrible. It took me out of it all throughout. When Pesci kept calling Deniro “kid” I was like you gotta be kidding me. Y’all look the same age as each other through the whole movie. There’s one shot where the camera was really close to Deniro’s face and he looked super young and that was a shot where he was supposed to be older. I didn’t even know what was going on half the time and not in a good way and also who tf is going to remember all the characters that are introduced? I was very very disappointed with this movie.

It's hard to put your finger on it.. Their skin looks good and all that, I also think they did a great job with the software, it's actually mind blowing, but it's like there are things that stick out soooooo much! Their noses are still huge old man noses, and their lips look weird when they talk, and the eyes look old... I don't know, it's like they can take the age out of the face, but they can't take the age out of their mannerisms, or their MOVEMENTS!!! Holy crap, it's so weird to see someone that is supposed to be like 30, moving like an 80 year old... The scene where Deniro kicks the crap out of the store owner, if you pay attention you'll see some serious errors, like when the door window breaks, and the way Deniro is moving is just so old man like.... It makes this seriously bad ass character go from being scary as hell to seeming like a geriatric and ruining that immersion.. It's very distracting. Just when you start forgetting about the de-aging software, something like that happens and pulls you right out of the world.. All that being said, it's still fun... A nostalgia ride... Not as good as the other classics you mentioned, but still... It's a new Scorsese gangster flick with an all star line up... Hard to complain, the second you start hearing the ""Do whop"" music, it brings you right back to that first time you watched Goodfellas, and you can't help but get a little excited...

In scenes with DeNIro as the truck driver with dark hair, his eyes were still that of a 70+ year old. There were moments where when Joe Pesci would turn his head, I would see age spots on one side of his face disappear as he turned his head. Pacino looked ok. Movie wise, I think Scorsese over indulged himself. There were scenes that were literally repeated, but simply shot at a different location. The fat union boss that kept complaining about Hoffa did so multiple times. It got old after the second time. Yes, it was well crafted. Great cinematography.

I'm afraid that THE IRISHMAN doesn't even come close. While I was watching it, pinpointing the best scenes was quite easy. During the 1st part, it's when mob bosses RUSS BUFALINO and ANGELO BRUNO tell hitman FRANK SHEERAN (the title character) that he's in the middle of a betrayal plan without him knowing about it. During the 2nd part, it's when labor union leader JIMMY HOFFA and mob captain ANTHONY ""TONY PRO"" PROVENZANO start arguing about the latter not arriving to their meeting on time, which escalates until issues from the past are brought up. The thing is that these scenes are more personal. Even if the topic of discussion is something trivial (like whether or not traffic is a valid excuse for being late), it's compelling because of how much it means to the characters. Most of the movie unfortunately consists of talking from a business point of view. Of course that the characters are invested in what they're saying, but the stakes are different. It's not bad per se, but a more human approach would've helped the 210 minutes pass by a lot faster. During the 3rd part, the tone completely changes, and the number of great scenes increases. The pop songs and the over-realiance on narration are put aside (there's not even a lot of music score anymore either), which is more impactful. The de-aging effects are great, but it's hard to praise Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography. For the most part, the use of lighting and colors is pretty standard. Only 1/3 of the time he uses wide shots, crane shots and tracking shots. As I said before, the running time is mainly dedicated to conversations, and they're mostly filmed through close-ups and medium shots and edited with the shot-reverse-shot technique. I get that PEGGY SHEERAN (FRANK's daughter) only talking briefly in one scene (as an adult, at least) was done on purpose to make her words stick with the viewer more. I get that a good actress was still required in order to convey her thoughts without speaking. However, she doesn't get that many ""dramatically silent"" moments. She's practically an extra who happens to be in the center of the shot at times. I'm saying this because it was a good opportunity to cast an unknown actress and so she could have her big break. Using a famous and experienced actress like Anna Paquin felt like a waste. Was Al Pacino method-acting to the point where he was afraid he would disappear like his character did in real life? That would explain why he overacts like there's no tomorrow. Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci's performances are good. An advice to new directors out there: Using slow motion has to have a true purpose beyond being just a stylistic choice. It must highlight the intensity of the scene (dramatically or comedically) and help the audience pay attention to something that would be easy to miss otherwise. A bride and his father walking down the aisle with nothing else going on? Not needed. Especially if she's portrayed only as the daughter of a supporting character (I'm pretty sure we don't even find out what her name is).

Look guys, Martin Scorsese is one of the reasons I started watching quality cinema. Goodfellas, Taxi Driver, Casino, The Departed and the like are phenomenal films that will undoubtedly stand the test of time. Make no mistake as to how excited I was to see The Irishman and how much I love Scorsese's work. But instead of the mob epic that the critics have been raving about all I saw was a long-winded, meandering mess in dire need of editing. Plot points were very repetitive and scenes that added absolutely nothing lingered on for way too long and for no good reason. The de-aging technology was distracting as it was poorly done. DeNiro looked like he had a slightly younger face for past scenes but still moved like an old man. Moreover, the film's message didn't need such an obscene runtime to be brought across. If The Irishman didn't have Scorsese's name in addition to this fine roster of actors attached, it would've been shat all over. Tell me with a straight face that this film holds a candle to Goodfellas. I think people are talking about The Irishman because Scorsese made disparaging remarks bout Marvel films before it was released, thereby creating a mass dichotomy of ""real cinephiles"" vs ""mindless Marvel fanboys"", thereby alienating those who had legitimate criticism about The Irishman and putting them in the latter category.

Love De Niro... check.

Love Pesci... double check.

Love The Irishman... not so much. 

I know I'm alone in feeling this way, but I didn't care for it. I've seen this movie before,  just with different character names... done much better... by Scorsese. It was long, not just in time of play, there were parts where watching it felt like walking up a steep hill carrying a lot of weight.  After I finished watching it I checked IMDb for the play time, and thought it was lying. I thought ""there's no way that was only a half hour longer than Casino,  easily three times longer. Didn't I start watching this the day before yesterday"". Maybe I went into it with my hopes to high, and nothing could live up to my expectations.  Maybe I'm wrong, but I think with that director and those three main actors doing a mob movie no matter how good or bad it was it was still going to be loved. For me though it wasn't that good. I think if the exact same movie (by this I mean exact same performances, exact pacing, everything exactly the same except the people involved) were directed by John Nobody and starred three C list actors it would be bombed by critics for its pacing, it's length, and the fact it's been done before and much better.",none,,2021-02-20 17:55:57.769335,0

This is the Best story of any of his movies.  So yeah, was somewhat happy with the outcome:
The Title:  HA HA, it Isn't 'The Irishman'.  The REAL Title is the same as the book:  'I Hear You Paint Houses', kudos Martin  :)
Pesci kills it as Russel Buffalino, he deserves another best supporting statue.  The movie chugs along fine early on.  It's when it gets to the Hoffa stuff like 1 1/2 - 2 hours in that it starts to falter and the Missed Opportunities of not showing things in the book begin to pile up.
Scenes that would have been necessary to really establish the close bond between Frank and Jimmy that weren't shown:

Not showing more of the conflict in Detroit with the rival cab company, Frank marching up to their headquarters single handedly to face their leader, Crucial scene to show the kind of balls he really had.
The scene where Jimmy marches into a meeting filled with members of the rival company backed up only by Frank.  The omission of this material really hindered any sense of how much Jimmy really depended on Frank. 

Then the 'Get Hoffa' part, I only knew what was really going on because I read the book.
Nothing about the first trial, Jimmy playing the 'race card' beautifully.  Joe Louis & the black lady attorney from SF he hired meet and got married.
It was essential for the movie to go into this stuff more to establish the fact that it was Jimmy Hoffa who put Jimmy Hoffa away.  HE bribed when he had his cases won but he was his own worst enemy.  This is important because this was a Legitimate reason as to why the mob wanted him whacked.  Sometimes he made bad decisions and became his own worst enemy.  But the movie fails with this. 

Pacino as Jimmy Hoffa, inconsistent, better in certain scenes than in others.  The lady who plays Jo Hoffa who played the babysitter in Goodfellas is great though.
Other Painful omissions that Should Have been included:
The second scene with David Ferrie, the JFK assassination stuff (""Heya Frank, long time no see.."")
The payoff scene with Attorney General John Mitchell (""These things don't come cheap"", and 'whoosh' went the briefcase..)

 At the end, I was expecting reflections on what little legacy he left:
The Italian mob is gone, unions are nothing to speak of anymore including the Teamsters, all that's left is Vegas, not anything to feel proud of after all the bullshit and killing.
But it wasn't there, Frank doesn't reconcile with his daughters and then picks out a coffin for himself.
The end,  too bad, could've been So Much More Meaningful..",none,,2021-02-20 17:55:58.310603,0

It lacked tight editing, scenes lingered far too long to make artistic points. The technology of that allowed the actors to be made younger was not impressive given the actors could not move as if they were younger. The one scene that made this point, was when De Niro's character roughs up a corner grocer for shoving his daughter. The scene is difficult to watch given De Niro seemed to struggle as much with his own lack of mobility to carry off the fight scene realistically despite having the willing and compliant younger actor. Al Pacino's character looked nothing like Hoffa. Yes the acting was good in general, but the story was just too drawn out and slow and the characters were just not that interesting to hold your attention. As a man of 58, the hardest fact is recognizing the increasing limitation as we age, this movie opens with De Niro's character in an assisted care facility. It is where this movie should have stayed.

Also, they left out the IMPORTANT aspect of Nixon pardoning Hoffa with the proviso of not running for president of the Union, until 1980. Which pissed the real-life Hoffa off.

Yes, it was definitely plot over character, but the plot was also really thin. You expect to get some pay off at the end, but it just gets worse. I‚Äôd rather describe this movie as visuals over plot or character. 

The plot was not only thin, at times it was ridiculous. Protagonist‚Äôs worry over damsel in distress is dumb as he hardly knows her. And I don‚Äôt see it working that this somehow has to do with him knowing her really well in the future.

I found John David Washington‚Äôs acting sub par at many times. He wasn‚Äôt cast right for this movie.

The music was also too present. There‚Äôs always some of that in Nolan‚Äôs movies, but the new sound guy went over the edge that Zimmer knows how to hold. Did like the reverse sound bits.",none,,2021-02-20 17:47:01.863232,1

1 - The director fails to explain the movie in a reasonable way.

3 - The casting is really bad, it's one of the main issues with the movie (with exception of Debicki and Pattinson). You do not buy the protagonist as a tough guy. Sometimes he is even insecure.
4 - Too much stuff happening in a short period of time, like easily breaching a lot of ""impossible"" ¬¥places.
5 - The first time you watch the movie, you have the sensation that the ""reverse power"" is useless.

Every about 1 in 200 people (statistic IMDB and other sources) actually got what the movie is about and that tells plenty.
The character development was simply not in the movie it starts after the movie ends and before it starts, otherwise we would have a 4-6hour movie, which would be a compromise if he made it a triology but he did not mostly because like this it gets people guessing on multiple accounts with only clues scattered around.
Hollywood, youtubers, media, critics, even part of the audience wanned this movie to be spoonfed to them (oh yeah that is the word), with everything explained, everything easily comprehensible and slow as they are slow-minded, but that completely neglects witty audience who got a blast watching it and who enjoy solving mysteries.
The entire movie is not only a pincer, reversed, with a twist, with mixed timelines and mixed values, but on a deeper level encrypted with several ""keys"" like ""the backpack"" or ""the jump"" scattered about  in different parts of the movie.
People used to stone and hang other people who said sun is at the center of the solar, or earth is spherical, and guess what, only the tools changed, people stayed the same.

Inception was great
Interstellar was great
But his films drag and if the story on itself is just whatever it's bad.
If people haven't realized yet Nolan does what Yoko Taro does, he  thinks of a cool ending and just make stuff happen to lead to the final plot twist. The thing is though that Yoko Taro never misses. Not only he has an amazing ending that even in Ancient Greek plays people knew that the ending can make or ruin a story but Yoko Taro makes several stories that merge and interwind in an amazing ending before the ending and it always makes sense. Nolan on the other hand just makes a single story and up until Tenet his stories were good, and then the single average-good to great story that doesn't always make sense  leads to a great ending. The problem is that with Tenet the story was average and it didn't make sense , even if the ending was great the story is weak and can't stand on it's own. Realistically is a 7/10 but I will give it a 5/10 just so that Nolan will come down of his high horse and put more effort on writing a story.",none,,2021-02-20 17:47:02.184878,0

First of all, the sound design is terrible, to the point where I think Nolan just needs to make silent movies from now on.  If you're not going to have the dialogue be intelligible, there's no point in having sound.  That's not to say I couldn't hear *anything*, but the beginning of the movie, where a lot of the exposition comes in, was unintelligible.  

I  like a movie that makes you think.  I liked Inception and Memento for that reason.  I even liked Interstellar *despite* the sound problems.  But TENET just took it too far.  It was too incomprehensible, and the thing is, it looks like that was by design.",none,,2021-02-20 17:47:02.505071,0

The characters have NO back story. You care about none of them. The plot is convoluted  pile of sh**. Example a woman meets the main character and knows nothing about him and decides to tell him her lives story within one minute of meeting him. The acting in most part is decent but does not stand out in any way. It is pretty to look at but come on this is just a bad movie. The final action scene is just a horrendous mess. One thin I need to mention is that they can show a guy beat his wife and almost kill her and threaten to beat her with a belt and give a movie pg 13 rating but if you throw in a couple of swear words it is immediately an R rating. :D,none,,2021-02-20 17:47:02.505853,0

However it was said by the actor and director of the movie himself, Tom Wiseau, that the movie was intended to be black humor, hinting that the awkward dialogues and bad acting were put there deliberately to create confusion and was not meant to be taken seriously.

TENET felt like such a movie. But what worries me the most is that TENET was probably in fact a serious attempt at being a pretentious movie. The plot and dialogue were absolute nonsensical that it slowly became comedic, were it not that Nolan intentions probably was to make an intelligent movie, however done it so that it was deceiving and played games with the audience perception, but underestimated the intellect of the audience, meaning you cannot cover up nonsensical plotlines with confusing dialogues. Now I am all for absurd dialogues in the style of maybe like Quentin Tarantino's movies, but it needs to be executed smartly, not randomly.

Therefore as a deliberate black comedy, I would have given this movie a 9, if it was intended that way, but I think not. So I give it 3 stars and this movie might end up in the list as one of the worst films ever made next to ""The Room""....",none,,2021-02-20 17:47:02.803011,1

When he does this, I immediately get the impression that you're in a very loud space, and you're trying to have a convo with someone, and because I always get that impression, it immerses me more in the scene. That coupled with the way he uses the IMAX shots to make the audience feels like a part of the scene works... for me. It's not very practical, as a lot of people will not be impacted this way. However, it's very intelligent, yes it has a tradeoff, but Nolan knows that you're more than likely going to revisit his film, in which case you'll pay more attention to the dialogue this time around (subtitles lol). 

My only grievance with this film is Washington's reaction to being introduced to inversion. I think up to that point, he had not been exposed to terrorism so other-wordly, so to speak, and his reaction was not consistent with the typical recoiling human response indicative of ignorance. It was too quickly accepted. Other than that, this was an epic movie.",none,,2021-02-20 17:47:02.803196,0

There is nothing to get from this film. Nothing in this film makes sense. There are dozens of very bizzare directing choices in this movie, with no actual meaning behind any. Very bad writing, uninteresting characters which are quite literally NONAMES and you don't even care about them at all. Do you even know a name of main character? See what i am talking about? 

The best part is the ending scene where we supposed to care about.. about something that Nolan completely forget to tell us about. What we actually were supposed to care about? Nolan? Are you there?

All in all, there is no deep plot in this movie. Frankly, there is no plot at all. Nolan was really bussy trying so hard to make it ""hard to understand"" sort of film. I am pretty damn fucking sure that he lolled and flexed on the fact that his fans will make a better explanation to shit they just witnessed, than he ever will be able to come up with. 

I believe, that we created a Nolan that is now very much believing that he can make any film with any plot, or without any plot like the one called TENET, to make us believe that there is a deep meaning that will make sense, and we will try our best to understand shit. 

No, i was not impressed by this shit of yours Nolan, and i knew in about 15 min of film what i was looking at. Nice try, tho..

In any case.. if you really want something unique, meaningfull, and with excellent writing arround time travelling and time paradoxes.. may i introduce you to The DARK film on netflix.

However it was said by the actor and director of the movie himself, Tom Wiseau, that the movie was intended to be black humor, hinting that the awkward dialogues and bad acting were put there deliberately to create confusion and was not meant to be taken seriously.

TENET felt like such a movie. But what worries me the most is that TENET was probably in fact a serious attempt at being a pretentious movie. The plot and dialogue were absolute nonsensical that it slowly became comedic, were it not that Nolan intentions probably was to make an intelligent movie, however done it so that it was deceiving and played games with the audience perception, but underestimated the intellect of the audience, meaning you cannot cover up nonsensical plotlines with confusing dialogues. Now I am all for absurd dialogues in the style of maybe like Quentin Tarantino's movies, but it needs to be executed smartly, not randomly.

Therefore as a deliberate black comedy, I would have given this movie a 9, if it was intended that way, but I think not. So I give it 3 stars and this movie might end up in the list as one of the worst films ever made next to ""The Room""....",none,,2021-02-20 17:47:03.803798,0

Inception is the best movie for me in 20 years.

Audiences are saying f--- it, I'm outta here. Could movies die out for 20 years and then come back? In 5 years only 20% of what was released 2 years ago will be the new normal.

yet somehow u knew what was going to happen because its like an exact carbon copy of interstellar and inception just with a different theme and packaging slapped on it and completely flipped around to make it extra politically correct,now its about a women's love for her son and her abusive husband,except we dont get to see the relationship between mother and son.....yay feminists who go their own way!!!and it involved people of all colour,we got black,muhammad and also indian.....

im guessing hollywood must have paid nolan a juicy 10 or 50 million dollars to make this joke of a movie......

just sit back and watch without constantly thinking about what is going 
on and why. Some might call it complex for the sake of complexity, but I
 disagree. The concept itself is complex but the movie simplifies it as 
much as possible and it works. Yes the characters seem shallow but I 
think that was the whole point. As the movie puts it, no one cares about
 the people who disarms the bomb, because no one cares about the bomb

All except for Robert Pattinsons neil who was good and he understood almost everthing. This movie also had a hard time differentiating between when it used the reverse time effect and it didn't, like the opera house in the beginning and the running up the wall in India (both didn't used the reverse time effect). This movie also left a lot of base questions that didn't get answers like: who is John David Washington working for, how is Michael Cain and Robert Pattinson connected and what side is Priya on? It also seemed like the characters of Kat and John David Washington kept handicapping the plan for no reason, should of stayed low key. And lets talk about the biggest useless plot point the Algorithm. The locks were cool and if the Algorithm was connected to them or responsible for the reverse materials I get that but beside there being 9 parts and it could reverse time if destroyed, there just was no reason. And what was it's base function? Again the locks were cool, but we don't know who made them and two were needed for the plot and let's not forget THE MILITARY HAD ONE THE WHOLE TIME, if Sator was a threat why didn't they send some agents in reverse? Really if it was nuclear bombs instead of the Algorithm then it might of been more understandable.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, as I am a fan of his movies of Christopher Nolan‚Äôs movies. But here‚Äôs the thing of Christopher Nolan and his movies for me. About me watching the movies that he has directed over the years, when I was 4 years old, his movie of Batman Begins came out in 2005 and I was only just a little kid, and I was too young to watch that movie in the theaters, along with The Dark Knight, as The Dark Knight was released in July of 2008, and I was just 8 years old when that movie was released back in 2008, and finally, when the last and final Batman movie of The Dark Knight trilogy was released in 2012, which was The Dark Knight Rises, unlike the other 2 movies of Batman directed by Christopher Nolan, that was my very 1st movie directed by Christopher Nolan that I ever saw in the theaters of my whole life, and then after 2012, I never saw any other movie in the theaters that was directed by Christopher Nolan in the theaters in the years that followed. And I can‚Äôt remember from 2013 or 2015 or 2016 or 2018 or even 2019, but from released in theaters in November of 2014, there was another movie directed by Christopher Nolan called Interstellar and I wanted to see it in theaters, and I honestly don‚Äôt really know why, but I never saw it in theaters, and I rented it a while later on the RedBox and I saw it on my TV at my house and it was quite an impressive movie, and then in July of 2017, Christopher Nolan had another movie released in the theaters, and this one was based on a true story of World War 2, and this movie was Dunkirk, and again, I rented that on RedBox, and this new movie being by yet again Christopher Nolan, I saw this movie in the theaters, literally 8 years after I saw The Dark Knight Rises 8 years ago back in 2012. And well, here‚Äôs the other thing. Back in July of 2017 from literally 3 years ago, my best friend and I went to go and see another movie in the theaters and he and I wanted to hang out and go to the movies, and well, before we went to go and see the movie, we both walked into a movie theater checking it out, and Dunkirk was the movie, but I don‚Äôt think it counts as my second movie from Christopher Nolan, as we only was a little bit of it and then we both walked out of the theater heading on down to sit down and watch the movie we were at the movie theaters for us. But that‚Äôs not the point. The point is, I have only seen not 1, but 2 movies directed by Christopher Nolan in the theaters in an 8 year time period of my life. Who else has seen a movie in the theaters directed by a director and it‚Äôs been a long time since you have seen a movie directed by him or her in the theaters, and then it‚Äôs your 2nd or even your 3rd movie directed by him or her in the theaters years later after you saw this movie or that movie you saw in the past directed by him or her in the theaters?",none,,2021-02-20 17:47:04.463161,0

I consider myself a moderately intelligent moviegoer, and i didn figure out he was fightng himself in the airport scene and it was the wife jumping off the boat pretty early on. The sound mixing was god awful. The reasons why the protagonist would endanger his mission for a woman he just met.. seemed silly. Didnt learn enough to care about the characters motivations. Thought Pattinson and Branagh were great,  Washington...just ok..a bit wooden.

My question(s) is this: 

Why were there the two teams (red/blue) in the end, i mean i know one was going forward, one was going back...but why?
Who were they fighting? 
Why were they fighting? 
What were they doing? 
How did that change anything? 
Did anyone hear anything besides explosions? 

I have many more but will wait to see if this isn't buried under 10000 comments. Looked great, shot great, movie should have been 4 hours long..maybe it would have made sense...sound was a HUGE problem.",none,,2021-02-20 17:47:04.463413,0

I avoided everything about Tenet before watching it last night. For me, it was far from his best work. I don't have a problem with it being complex or needing to watch it more than once to fully understand it. To me, my biggest problem with Tenet is that nothing is really personal or meaningful for the characters. We barely get to know them or even care about them. 

My whole thought the entire movie was why does The protagonist care or have to loose? What's at stake for him? One of the reasons given in the movie is to ""save the world"" which to me is extremely generic and cliche. The other is that he seems extremely vested in the girl and her son but why? There's no real love story or deep connection there at all. 

That's where this movie really lost me. Yes there was really cool things to look at and the score was amazing but I didn't walk away feeling any deep connection between the characters nor did I care for them much. 

In Inception, Dom is trying to get home to be with his children. And he carries the burden of his wife killing herself because of something he did. A father reuniting with his children if the mission is accomplished or going to jail for life if he fails gives great motivation and shows the consequences. Tenet has none of this. It's pretty much a guy trying to save the world bc it's his job. The consequences is the world ending, okay I get it... But it doesn't really matter if we don't care about anyone on screen. The main character really has no other goal or anything to loose other than just doing his job.",none,,2021-02-20 17:47:04.463843,1

Leaving the theater after watching Inception left me with questions about the characters, the overall state of mind that Hobb has at the conclusion, lessons learned for each member of the squad, and what was to become of the man who accepted a lie that his father loved him and that he wanted him to live his life the way that he wanted, what was to become of this man. See with inception, there was a heft that came with each of its characters and development of them as well as the plot. The plot was complicated, yet not so convoluted to the point where the viewer was left with questions about the plot itself, most of us understood what was happening, it was more of understanding the deeper side of the psyche of the characters (hence, the ever so infamous question, is Hobb still dreaming at the end of the movie.) 

With this movie, I felt as if Christopher found that the success of Inception hinged on the fact that some of the plot points being complicated made the movie enjoyable, but that isn't the case. Tenets major problem is that there are extreme complexities within the rules and regulations of how the world works, and these complexities are thrown at us at a blistering speed that nearly robs us of the enjoyment of an easy going movie experience. 

Don't get me wrong, damn near every Nolan film has some sort of depth and has its own twists and turns, but Tenet just felt as if Nolan wanted to make the most complex, convoluted, and hard to follow story in recent memory, and in that he succeeded. But where Inception shined with character, and development, Tenet completely lacks these same traits and feels more like a giant meal with too many things added to it, yet has no flavor at all.",none,,2021-02-20 17:47:04.463942,0

His latest turd seals the deal for me- tenet... oh my fucking god, what an abysmally shallow mess.

I don't mind this, but in this film, characters would exchange vital information that explains what they're going, why they're doing it, and how it all works and 70% of it was muffled.

Pros: 
music is really interesting; I even listen to the soundtrack on my phone
acting is spot on
the idea of inversion is cool

Cons:
there is really no story to pull you in (the screenplay writer needs to find a new job)

the end fight scene...the ""good"" guys are shooting at...someone I guess...rarely showed the enemies
very poor job of explaining what's going on (there is a painting that is fake, go talk to this guy about it, now kill him; I mean...don't, or else everyone will die, but then do it anyway)

Alcoholic Robert Pattinson is funny the first 5 minutes.
The music is so intense all the time for no reason because nothing happens on screen that reasons the usage.
Many ridiculous scenes, and I'm not even talking about the ones that involve backwards time.
It seems that nothing is actually clear and they don't follow their own rules many times.
""Bad people are bad, so we have to kill them first"".
This movie insults my intelligence. And that makes me quite angry to be honest. 


2:30 hours of nonsense just trying to understand it for no reason meaning even if I ""know"" what is going on I don't even care anyway. They can all die for all I care since they don't even feel human, just programmed dolls with ""conversations"".
So I'm supposed to just eat this load of garbage of a movie to fulfill Nolan's fantasies that he can actually make movies and Denzel's son's fantasies that he can make a badass character with the way he walks and kiss their feet and thank them and go watch it again in 3D. Yeah, not happening. This movie is so much better towatch if you are drunk, since you will stop paying attention and sleep through it. A better use of your time, believe me.

SPOILERS












This has nothing to do with time but a stupid premise that allows things to go backwards but zapping it in a microwave. There is the main character who fails at everything surprising because his only qualification for his position was suicide. The second character knows everything solves every problem and is completely pointless besides that. The third character is important because she was impregnated by the bad guy with no redeeming qualities, it is a plot point that he is so selfish he will destroy the world because he is dying.
There is no suspense in this movie if you follow the plot you figure out that everything has already happened therefore we're waiting for the omniscient trainee to do what he came to do and guess what he did. The surprise was they put the woman who tried to kill her husband and showed nothing but selfish and bad decision making in charge of not killing the bad guy, oops.
Time had no theory here they don't solve the paradox they create nor do they mess with it as a dimension it is just things can now go backwards through time which makes no fucking sense because for time to act that way it would not be a river that can change but a straight line where there is no consequence from your choices and therefore no free will. I hated Interstellar for abandoning it's science to have it's resolution but at least the premise was strong this is just stupid. Transformers has as much intelligence and action as this heartless silly movie.
I love The Prestige, Inception, Momento and others films he's made but this is soulless and just a premise to have cars drive backwards.",none,,2021-02-20 17:47:05.092760,0

So you have several things working against you in the first half. That mix is favoring the music and sound effects over the volume of the voices. Of course the start of the movie is the set up so you want to hear that key dialogue. compounding that is the plot is complicated and the character names are confusing. Finally a lot of the scenes are special forces guys who are wearing gas masks or oxygen masks, muffling their voices. Now luckily I'd heard it was a complicated film so went in paying 100% attention and managed to follow it. So the film itself. If you guys have ever heard or watched a sci fi comedy show called Red dwarf, If I were to rank the best episodes from that show to top 5 there is one somewhere in my top 5 that plays with this exact sci fi/ physics theory about time flowing backward. The famous scene from it was this backward pub/ bar fight where the crew are experiencing it forward in time. Its like Nolan took that seed of a sci fi idea and put it in a spy movie, but I agree it took a while to get going.

Jeremy got it spot on, they explain the complicated things in this movie flawlessly, but the simple things, such as character development and just setting the scenes are poorly thrown together. On top of that, whats a simple throw away line of a mom wanting to remove her son from a asshole billionaire becomes the entire driving thread for the entire movie. Whats worse, it's only reinforced or made important by a simple ""you don't know what its like to be a mother"" line. While the ENTIRE FATE OF THE WORLD IS AT STAKE fyi. Back to the pacing, it starts off fast and does not slow down. I get it, its a thriller, edge of your seat ride. but the simple editing is so hard to keep track of. There's a portion where John David Washington's character begs for a spot at a exclusive dinner for the following day, -30 seconds later he's at the exclusive dinner and immediately leaves, -30 seconds later its the following day and the person he just met is speaking to/of him as if they've been lifelong friends. That break neck speed is the entire movie, even in exposition logs that should take its time to allow the audience to process the very important information that was always being conversed at a million miles a second. The conversations are very to the point, and leaves little to actual world building other than a few flashback sequences. (The reason behind this was explained in film, but just because you warn the bank before you rob them does not make the crime any less punishable.)

But. it is a Nolan film after all,
It is a good movie. If you can keep up and hold onto key information through out the film, you will be thoroughly rewarded come the film's climatic last act. Even keener eyes would pick up the stories loosely predictable patterns -(not a complaint) before the characters do themselves. Once you start to develop the way of thinking that the characters are forced to learn themselves in order to operate in this world, the movie becomes a lot more fun. The story is unique, the actions scenes are phenomenal, and the ending predictable, but in a good payoff-ish way.

As Jeremy said, This is most likely a 3 1/2 hour movie that was compressed down to 2 1/2. Not to mention I'm positive the pandemic is largely responsible for some of the poor editing choices with the editors working largely from home and a potential delay between communication with the director. If there ever is a ""directors cut"" this movie would easily be on par with movies such a The Dark Knight and Interstellar. This isn't the ""Movie industry savior"" as some hoped it would be, but it'll definitely get your heart racing in key moments. 

No one asked a random guy on the internet comment section, but if i had to rate it, I'd give it a 7.5/10
That's a tough score admittingly, yet if it were not for the pacing alone, this movie would be sitting much much closer to a 10.

I was able to piece together the gist but man, this sound mixing was the worst I've ever heard. And this script needed another run through. Ultimately his weakest film IMO. One of my big concerns is Nolan is  going down this path of less and less character development. Dunkirk was basically a bunch of one dimensional characters on a beach, but essentially worked because of the device of this being basically real, and following three time lines. But now we are basically getting an action thriller. There's no need for these characters to be so weak. Kenneth Brannagh was the most layered character here, and he's the one we aren't supposed to identify with. 

I'm fine with filmmakers pursuing similar themes to their other film's. All great artists are basically obsessed with one or two ideas in all their work. But for Nolan to release a film with characters this lacking, it's like a rookie mistake. He's made nearly a dozen pictures at this point.

The characters were super one dimensional and boring with no personality what so ever. So everything the characters did had no meaning behind it at all... Even the countless boring dialogue scenes could not add in any lines to give any of the characters any personality traits which made it seem like every dialogue scene was just two robots having a conversation  on screen....some scenes did look visually stunning, but every movie with a high budget is going to look good. If there are cool fight scenes, but you are not emotionally attached to the outcome of the fight scenes, then the scene just turns into every other generic fight scene we‚Äôve seen in hundreds of other action movies... 
even after doing research on the plot, the plot is just like every other generic  action movie but they just introduced the inverted aspect to it which was cool and different, but still felt like any other boring generic action movie plot but with some parts moving in reverse...I can‚Äôt say I enjoyed this movie one tiny bit for what it was... I definitely would not recommend this movie to anyone.",none,,2021-02-20 17:47:05.749378,0

Nobody in Cinema has ever represented the image of the hero like Nolan did in all his movies. He as always chose the perfect actors for the roles: there is a scene where Branagh is really mad, and he changes totally the look of his eyes... Amazing!... And well, I love how Nolan is moving forward in his attention to time and how it affects people Life and mind, and I'm Happy he seems to be faraway from that freudian and stupid idea of the dream as physical space, he had in Inception (his worst movie, maybe...)...

Your mind gets blown away at the what Chris Nolan was trying to achieve . Wait....should i put "" was"" or  ""is  going to"" Cos it hasnt happen yet , unless u watch it the 2nd time . 

The magnitude of the entire concept of this movie is strectching my brains to its limits . Never have i watched a movie 2 times and gets Awed at the ingeniuity of the Twist at the end , which is also the beginning . 

Its the concept of the movie thats intrigueing . Not the plot nor the cast . Its a rather simple plot to begin with, ur normal spy movie, with no hollywood A lister heavyweight  cast . Michael Caine was for just a 5 min scene . 

The entire movie was a roller coaster mind bender. It starts of with a loud Bang , then a slow climb to the Top then the sudden  drop towards midway till the end . I was gasping for air. 

Many people left the cinema wondering what happened . It left me wanting more. Half suspecting i missed something, there is a message in the movie i missed . I couldnt put my finger to it, it compels me to watch it again , 

And when i did. It was as though i reach a state of Zen and became part of the movie . I totally understood what Chris Nolan was saying to me , my future self when i watched it the first time. 

You see . There was a message did you see it? If yes what did you think of it ? Feel free to comment below . However i cant tell you what it is. Whatever happens , happens for a reason",none,,2021-02-20 17:47:05.750600,0

It's a movie where you need to pay attention to details. I looked away for a few seconds on the first time and didn't see it was the backpack guy that saved the Protagonist at the Opera, so yeah, pay attention guys. Details come and go really fast. Also when you know all the twists, you notice new things. For example, it happened to me when I saw the car scene the second time.

What I expect from an action movie is me sincerely going ""fuck yeah"" or ""holy shit"", and that keeps me focused on it, wanting more. This movie did that. And it even brought tears to my eyes, so yeah, all the points from me.

And I don't want a sequel. I want a prequel. Of Neil's life before all of this happened. Neil was, by far, my favourite character.

Inception and Interstellar were brilliant because they had big ideas that were perplexing at times with action set pieces that worked, and the ideas you could grasp them eventually- and they were interesting- here they are not even if the storytelling was better. This film seems like Nolan doing a parody of his earlier works. It wants to entice you with its spectacle; extremely loud, extremely bombastic action scenes and thundering score, but only comes across as aggravating. He is doing a bad impression of himself LITERALLY. The discussions over time between the male leads seem posed and silly- and feel like an imitation of Gordon Levitt and Dicaprio in Inception. That's another thing- the dialogue in this movie is so damn bad. The whole film is a letdown. Rating: Big, loud and forgettable. Also, the statuette blonde Birkin bag carrying Sloaney who is fighting for her son- I'm so over this female trope (can you even write good female characters Nolan?) Oh, and the bad bond villain played by Kenneth Branaugh it laughable chud. It was pure spectacle big noise nonsensical dialogue self fellatio parody big bravado GARBAGE. I actually really did not have fun watching this; the music was deafening; the story, the dialogue, and the cardboard characters were icing on the BS.

The performances are too stoic. Zero personality, except brannaugh. Pattinson was a nonentity too. The action was not discernable from the average Bourne-knock-off shaky cam. What does the !movie offer other than interesting locales and movie effect of reversing camera footage backwards? Doctor Strange movie did it better and clearer and it was actually impressive..

1. Inception
His most complete movie. Complex plotting, decent character work, emotional undertones, mind-blowing visuals and direction.
2. The Dark Knight
Unstoppably great on every level, but lacking the flair and originality that puts Inception on top for me.
3. Dunkirk
Visually brilliant, remarkably intense, painting in broad swathes of emotion rather than an emotional core of a relationship, and his usual time-switching style makes this thoroughly engaging and powerful.
4. Interstellar
Delves deeper into the human side of Nolan‚Äôs characters, it possesses astounding visuals and easily understood characters, with a simpler plot line that nevertheless plays well with the ideas of fate and family.
5. Tenet
Pure story, pure spectacle, gripping and tense, with a intricate plot to be pieced together alongside set-piece brilliance.
6. The Prestige
Intriguing and entertaining, it wows with revelation after revelation as it races with parallel stories towards a series of wonderful twist endings.
7. Memento
Groundbreaking and smart, Nolan‚Äôs breakthrough effort is still cleverly designed and possesses just enough hidden depth to be a little more than just a gimmick.
8. The Dark Knight Rises
Flawed but still a worthy and emotionally resonant conclusion to the Dark Knight Trilogy.
9. Batman Begins
Nolan redefines the superhero genre in a competent character study of Batman‚Äôs origins.
10. Insomnia
Well-made, if not particularly interesting or original.
11. The Following
Intriguing concepts abound in his debut, which though decent enough to watch lacks the finesse or the true subtlety to handle a smaller film.",none,,2021-02-20 17:47:07.328154,1

It's even worse the 2nd time around. I was hoping it would get better but alas...it did exactly the opposite.  All of its flaws were accentuated. It's an incoherent, convoluted, incomprehensible mess. We just don't care about the characters. There's no central dramatic spine or character driven idea that we care about. It's all just visual spectacle. 

It feels like Nolan had a 4 hour movie somewhere but he's had to cram in everything he wanted to tell, say and do into 2 1/2 hours. Doesn't work. the whole enterprise just feels terribly rushed.

Most of the dialogue scenes are risible and most disappointing of all (and a cardinal sin for a Nolan film) I was bored watching it again. Even the action scenes didn‚Äôt excite me the 2nd time around.

And you miss one expositional talk scene (and please...when is Nolan going to fix his sound mix? It's just awful. SFX are ear shatteringly loud and in yer face and then the more important dialogue scenes you have to strain to decipher) and you have no idea what's going on for the next 15 minutes. Just awful.

And that catamaran scene...WTF was that!? They're out on the boat and I thought oh yeah here we go...a decent action scene...And then they started talking!! Expositional talking! What!!?? I'm thinking 'what are they doing? Why are they talking about important stuff now I can hardly hear them. They've got helmets on and are talking through friggin microphones ffs!' Ludicrous.

Lee Smith's absence is notable too. I thought it was terribly edited, especially the interminable dialogue scenes in the first half an hour. Really disjointed and jarring.

And as for John David Washington...Well I thought he was awful. No gravitas at all. Terribly miscast. He was even worse the 2nd time round. And you've got Kenneth Branagh hamming it up like no tomorrow. He's almost laughable. And I know three dimensional female characters aren't exactly Nolan's strong suit but please...do you think we could have a bit more from Elizabeth Debicki (who does an ok job mind you. Don't get me wrong) other than ""I have a son""...who by the way we never discover and we are never privy to their relationship so how can we even care. Pattinson was decent enough and Aaron Taylor-Johnson had presence but was criminally underused.

I could go on but suffice to say...It's disappointing. I was expecting more. It's certainly not as bad as Interstellar but it's probably his duddest film after that...possibly in the realms of The Dark Knight Rises.",none,,2021-02-20 17:47:07.598935,0

The sound mixing is on purpose. Throughout the movie the spies repeat an idea so much it seems to be a theme: you only know what you need to know. This happens repeatedly. Team members are given only a part of the information. The sound mixing makes it so that the audience only knows what we need to know WHEN we need to know. When first encounter a scenario, the mixing muffled certain dialogue. When we encounter that scene again (spoilers) from a different perspective, I noticed the muffled dialogue was repeated more clearly. The sound mixing purposely lets us experience the same thing as the Protagonist on purpose. I think the confusing way in which we get the information is so we experience it‚Äôs unfolding like him.",none,,2021-02-20 17:47:07.892197,0

I don't want to encourage anyone to risk their lives. The only reason why I saw TENET is because the cinema I went to had the proper safety measures and because I live in Rome, where the COVID-19 cases aren't as high as other places (at least for now). If your situation is similar to mine, that's a whole other conversation. Now, the plot revolves around a secret mission. So secret that, a couple of times, the agents and the employers discuss it in public, including a ferry where they're surrounded by people. Wait, what? Like most of Christopher Nolan's works, we have a complicated plot involving a lot of real science and philosophy in our hands. Unfortunately, there's something missing that was present in his previous projects: Strong emotions that drive the main characters through their journey (a husband trying to kill his wife's murderer, a father who misses his son and daughter, a father who misses his daughter and I guess his son too, etc...). Here, we learn nothing about our hero. And don't tell me that's the point, like in DUNKIRK. That was because the soldiers served as vessels for the viewers to insert ourselves into, in order to feel what it's like to be in a war zone. Not to mention that 2017 hit was designed to be a complete visual and auditory experience. This one balances the images and the audio the same way most movies do, and the protagonist is presented as a real person. Without knowing what motivates him on a personal level (instead of just wanting to save the world), I couldn't connect with him and, by extension, with the movie. Also, he and a lot of the other characters are similar in terms of personality, whether they're displaying their inner strength, their intelligence or their sense of humor, so they don't stand out, unlike INCEPTION with its group of distinct individuals. Speaking of that 2010 classic, it didn't matter that the events were written as a traditional heist film, because they took place inside people's dreams. All kinds of unpredictable and imaginative things happened in each environment. Here, a special element is introduced early on, but it's not used to the fullest until the 2nd half. The 1st half is a traditional spy film (and not a very interesting one) that occasionally turns into science fiction. It would be easy to dismiss Jennifer Lame's editing as choppy. I mean, I can't remember a shot lasting more than 5 or even 2 seconds (to be fair, I wasn't actually timing them). There are even moments where a character is doing something and in the very next shot they're doing something else in another part of the room, indicating that at least a couple of seconds have passed. However, that and the near total lack of establishing shots makes me think that her hands were tied and she was just doing her best to reduce the running time down to 150 minutes. Honestly, I would've preferred it if she had deleted full scenes. Trust me: Not all of them were indispensable. No other aspect about this production is bad at all, but without something to get invested in, what's the point?

No, this was Nolan's way of turning the reversing bullet scene from Memento into a 2.5 hour movie, and it was underwhelming.

The protagonist does not have a name because he is replaceable with any black person. He is trying to move forward but few ppl are destroying their culture, society and the possibility of a bright future . As this unnamed protagonist is trying his best to move forward part of the society seems to go backward, from liberal world view to radical conservative ideas from stone age. And the reason for doing so is not rational, rather a emotional one. These people, these radical right wing bat shit crazy people have already realised that they are a dying bread and so they wish to destroy the building blocks of a civilised society. Nolan has compared this rotten mentality with inoperable cancer. 
To defeat these Madmen, liberals must move forward and backward at the same time. They need to go backward with the whole PC culture, Cancel culture and SJW shit. In response to conservative ideology the liberals have become overly sensitive radical leftist drama queens.

The Dark Knight Trilogy (yes all 3. To me it is one complete experience)
Inception
Memento
Tenet (maybe because I am still hyped and the film is fresh but I freaking loved this movie) 

After Memento/Tenet this is where it gets difficult.

I really did not like this movie. I find the inversion premise weak, and the action more gimmicky than immersive or awe inspiring. My reasoning against the inversion thing is that there is no real agency, everything is set in stone and nothing change because it already happened. Once destiny is in place, puff, whatever characters say and do stops mattering. 
The second point is about the action, as it is visually okish?!! Of course technically is very interesting, Nolan loving practical special effects is always on point, yet here they are also quite tame and grounded. So without spectacle, without awe, everything is.left to the plot to evoke emotions, but I felt no tension at all! It was just a show case of the inversion. Literally we know the good guys are going to win from the second we are exposed to the inversion principle, so what am I rooting for? It is just mindless slaughter. Honestly,  it was like watching a tech demo for future Nolan contracts. The whole movie is a Nolan 2hrs long trailer for his upcoming epics.",none,,2021-02-20 17:47:08.538362,0

The sound was awful. If you're going to make your movie a densely complicated headtrip maybe don't require your characters to deliver vital exposition through masks or on speedboats with explosions in the background.

The plot was neither here nor there: a standard Bond maguffin complicated by the rather silly inversion gimmick. Nolan manages, not for the first time, to make his ostensibly terrific practical action sequences look drab. The whole thing was a shrug and a headscratch when I wanted to punch the air.

He comes up with this Tenet crap,  a self-indulgent and conceited film. It's not serving the audience at all. It's just an action movie wrapped up in scenes of time going forwards and backwards. And the so-called big action sets are nothing new...Just vanity on the part of Nolan to not use CGI. They are only grand because the music is loud (done so amateurishly). The time inversion plot device is exposited in 5 mins and in some fantastical physics mumbo-jumbo.... No one explains how it is even triggered... it just happens. The darn inversion also happens willy nilly... And later a portal to the past is suddenly available, to let the good guys travel back into the past (wtf). At the end the movie, just to add to the mystery,  the black dude (Washington) has the gall to tell you he is the protagonist of the she-bang when it is clear the white dude (Paterson) is the one who has been puppet string-pulling everything all along. The ending is rushed:""Oh, there are other selves (what the fuck). Yes, the whole movie is about time inversion....and that's just the quick bait. In actual fact, it is all about a black dude trying to help a white woman leave her asshole of a husband. Why? Go figure. Great sex? No. Great kisser? No. Another WTF.

Plus the audio was so bad I had to revert to reading the subtitles (one more WTF). As for the dialog it's all sensible only to the characters, so don't even bother to try to make sense of it. This whole movie is like a baker making a confection only he likes. Who cares what the shoppers think or prefer or make sense of it.

I can see Nolan patting his back and think he has made another surprising movie like Inception.  But any movie that is obscure, intentionally obtuse, self-aggrandising and seemingly made for the director himself do not deserve to be in the cinemas. It's a Nolan lab movie. So Nolan, go fuck yourself and give me back my cinema ticket money, including popcorn. That's $40. 

Tenet is like Interstellar but worse. Taking a smidgen of a physics idea and try to make a family movie out of it. Only this time, the physics is out of everyone's depth and Nolan has the gall to tell the audience ""Don't bother to think about it."" Even a performance art film at a contemporary museum has better respect for the audience. At least you leave thinking and exploring some deep issue. With Tenet, it is just a fucking mess. Yes Nolan,, once more, Go fuck yourself.",none,,2021-02-20 17:47:09.764817,0

I guess we're all dumb asses for not thinking that was the easy part? 
But yeah the character relations definitely didn't help. 

Totally get the sound mixing comment, it kind of made the dialogue feel quite mixed up (lol) in the whole experience, like it flowed through it instead of with it as a distinct element. 

It kind of reminded me of Mad Max Fury Road except there it was done well. The dialogue really flowed with the tempo of the whole experience and meshed with it nicely but was distinct and clear. Also sparse, which probably helped.

The only time I do is when I'm on the fence about going to see it. Tenet hit at a good time for me. Not only was it a CN film but also it was the first movie to come out as the cinema reopened. Thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I was a bit worn down by the length but I'm also on a shit sleep scheduled ATM so I kind of blame that. The way they do the traveling in this movie blow me away. You've seen it dozens of times but this was fresh and like Jeremy said there aren't very many fresh movies out there. Most just play it safe or have a quick twist thrown in at the end.

The only other movies I've seen lately that were fresh to me were 1917 and JoJo rabbit. They've left me at least feeling something new. There are very few directors that are willing to step out nowadays either due to cancel culture and fear of backlash from the internet brigade. When watching JoJo rabbit all I could think of was how did this get made? Every time I saw Hitler doing random shit I wondered who had a stroke on the day this got pitched to have it gotten into production. It's the type of film that would enrage a mob and get boycotted on twitter with some stupid hashtag before they even got done with filming but it didn't. And it was great. Good writing, characters and a different perspective. Even though the end message was the nazi's were bad usually anything that even looks like bad people showing good characteristics is enough to send people off.

Sorry for the rant. It went a bit off base towards the end but I feel strongly about creative freedom and you don't get too much of that anymore.",none,,2021-02-20 17:47:10.035250,0

I watched The Dark Knight Rises two more times - each in a different theater - and the dialog was equally muffled by the score and the scenes background noise.

I agree though the movie is high concept as hell but I still really liked it. The thing though is this movie unlike inception puts its character really second to the plot. So that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs less accessible.

It‚Äôs definitely not in my top Nolan movies but as a concept it was dope.

The thing that surprised me most about this movie is that it really is nothing more than Christopher Nolan doing James Bond with the time inversion as little more than a McGuffin. Inversion is never really used to its full extent - not the way Nolan embraced the dream concept for Inception. 

The problem with this being a Bond film is that the action scenes, with a few notable exceptions, are really not that great and can't compete with what the best of the genre has to offer. Which is understandable - Nolan is more of an idea director, not an action director. His ideas are always more interesting than what is actually happening. Unfortunately, in this movie the ideas aren't as fully explored as they usually are in his films - leaving you with a feeling of bland emptiness. Plus it still had that Chris Nolan emotionless, cold objective observer feel that most of his films have.

Again, you are right, the sound balance was WAY off. Overall, I liked the film, but it just lacked much impact.",none,,2021-02-20 17:47:10.397430,0

I also think sound recording is often secondary for Nolan, which is like a film school taboo. I was a film student and my professors agreed that often the worst element of student films is the sound because they spend so much time forcusing on how the film looks and not enough time worrying about how it sounds. And Nolan is known for being an economical director, his productions pretty much never go beyond their filming schedule. He always finishes productions on time or ahead of schedule. So I think that's why the sound in his films is always one of the worst elements. The recording of the sound on the day-of seems to take a backseat for him compared to everything else.",none,,2021-02-20 17:47:10.398116,1

Then how come he wasn't seeing Niel Backwards like Sator and other Time Inverted objects and people when he went to meet Priya for the first time in Mumbai?  There is more to Tenet than you realise.
Movie starts with Opera, the painting name was Arepo. (same letters, inversed)
The bad guy was Sator. The security company at the airport was Rotas(again inverse of Sator)

Nonetheless I watched it in theatre twice and I'm tempted to watch it again (blessed be Cineworld and Cinema City for their monthly subscription model, blessed be indeed). Not because I didn't understand something; the movie is not that complex. But it was such a joy for hungry cinephile inside me. I love watching movies in theatre, it's my church (TENET on Wednesday and Friday, The New Mutants yesterday, and Unhinged most likely on incoming Friday).

HAHA! Seems them masks didn't help ya much Murica. HAHA! But anyways, seems i loved the movie far more then you Jeremy. I was half expecting this to be Awesometacular or atleast Buy it on Blu-ray worthy. I watched the two first trailers. And i honestly didn't know what to expect outside from that so i went in expecting a good Nolan movie. And that's what i got. I think if invert was the constant of this movie it would be a bit too much. I genuinly like how we experience the logic of it as the main character does. And i liked the characters and the dialogue. I'll admit the Russian badguy was very stereotypical to a point where he kinda made me laugh. But he still did a good job. But this movie does so well the whole upping it every act. Like it goes from a spy movie with some inverted bits in it to just all out timy whimy madness. Towards the end when you finaly start putting the pices together it's just like ''WOW!''. So i loved the film. I gave it a full score. All the actors did a great job for the most part. The story had me hooked. It was a true Nolan movie. I find it hard to put it on a list of top Nolan movies however. I don't really know... But i think Interstellar is my favorite simply because space is my thing. But it's also genuinly an Amazing film. The Dark Knight is probably second to it with Inception following that... But after that i just don't know what order to place the movies. All i know is that i have yet to see a Christopher Nolan movie i didn't love. Nolan at this point is just that Director i will allways go see the movies for. I know that his movies are cinematic masterpices trough and trough. And this one was no different. That final act tho.... Once everything comes together and you get it and the action pumps up.... It's so fucking insane! That final act is... Mindbendingly awesome! It's totally unique! And the ending... Well, it's confusing! But also not really. It's.... Hard to explain is what it is. But you get it if you pay atention. What ever, i'm allready pumped to see what Nolan does next. I mean the man has done ilusions, his done dream mind fuckery, his done time and space bending with Black holes and worm holes. And now hes done  timy whimy fuckery with reversed time flows and shit... What's next? It's kind of hard to imagine. Personaly i don't feel like TENET needs a sequel. It does wrap up it's story. So if there is a sequel it would have to be a new adventure in the same universe and maybe the same characters. I wouldn't mind it. But Nolan does run the risk of the not so good sequel syndrom if he does that. I think there would have had to be a door left open in the movie. And yeah, there are doors. But those doors are for ''The Adventures of_________'' really. The plot itself does wrap. So Nolan's next film should probably and will probably be something new. But at this point, what? It's hard to imagine. Maybe he'll mess around with Gravity? Maybe he'll do his take on something else that has been done? Imagine a post aphocalyptic spy movies with AI that has a heist plot.... I mean, all Nolan movies are in a sense a Heist. Well, most of them. Time heist, gangster heist, dream heist... HAHA! Or maybe he just gives up and makes a Childrens movie. I would watch that tho.",none,,2021-02-20 17:47:11.079760,0

Someone said it true - Tenet isn't for everyone.
You know what, Tenet can't be compared to other movies and what critics say is full of sh*t. Nolan used multi-layered storytelling to really keep the tension throughout the movie. But people are expecting some groundbreaking suspense in the end that unfortunately doesn't exist. The beauty of this movie lies in its roller-coaster journey and that's what Tenet wants to show you. A totally different angle of cinema that's unfair to be compared.

For most part I agree with you, it was definitely original take, no doubt about it. It also made me think that it's something I've never seen before when I left cinema. But that's where our similarities end i feel. I was very confused by set up and explanation of the world portrayed in the movie. And when I say confused, I mean I had no idea wtf was going on. I had general idea of concept , of course, and by no means I'm an average popcorn flicker , I love challenging movies ,but boy does this movie confused me. And not only me, when it finished and I looked at the audience, everyone was confused with a wtf  just happened written all over their faces. The story was rushed, without proper explanation I feel, which caused chain reaction of bloody confusion. The more I tried to get my head around it, the minute I thought I understood what was going on, Nolan threw new piece at me, that shattered everything I knew. And I'm afraid for me it wasn't in a good way. I felt alienated when I watched it, because I couldn't fully understand what was going on, as my friend whom with I went to see it, and rest of audience also. On top of that, sounds effects? Man, it was just overdone. I get the idea behind it, it is supposed to make you feel like you are actually on scene, but in a movie like that, where every bit is very important to understand, muffled dialogue doesn't help,it's actually doing opposite. It actually made me angry at times, that I can't understand what actors were saying, as it was obviously crucial in understanding the concept. The cinematography was amazing, as well as special effects, that's a standard in Nolan's movies. Actors played it amazing also, although I felt Pattison wasn't given enough attention, given how crucial of a character he happened to be in the end. It could've been amazing movie, the idea behind it is fantastic, but for me it was way overcomplicated on screen and sounds score has ruined it for me completely, rending it unwatchable. Maybe if I watch it another 10 times, then I'll change my mind, but as a one off in cinema I can't give it more then c minus. Also I just wanted to thank you for your reviews and all the work you do here, I think it's fantastic. Keep up, cheers.",none,,2021-02-20 17:47:11.347119,0

Cause I did like this movie but I certainly have a lot to say. Let‚Äôs start with this, I was like everyone else with Tenet. I was super excited, who wouldn‚Äôt be! Christopher Nolan directing, big budget summer blockbuster, with a complex plot, awesome trailer and a great cast! I‚Äôve been waiting for this movie for a long time and as soon as I found a showtime for my city I decided I had to go. So I saw Tenet and I have to say, this is a Christopher Nolan movie. It has his style of direction all over it. The complex and dense plot, big action spectacles and a long runtime. Will people like it, most likely unfortunate for me not so much. What really bothered me about this movie was the plot and how Nolan told this story. It didn‚Äôt feel cohesive or even understandable really but rather very confusing, rushed and the outcome of it all made me question what was the purpose of all that just happened. Even some of the plot points of this movie that kinda make sense doesn‚Äôt actually do. Like I didn‚Äôt really know much about the villain or his goals and there wasn‚Äôt enough character development to him other than a cliche evil plan, him being just a jerk but the actor who portrays him did a good job. The acting of this character gave an impression of unintentionally being funny and entertaining. But a lot of this movie felt like it was trying to be an extravaganza of action scenes, set pieces and dazzling spectacles. Luckily It does accomplish that though, a lot of the times. The action is really well done and does a lot of the spectacles. I just wish that the movie presented a more compelling story, because it felt as though it was kinda trying too. The story, plotting and even sometimes the screenplay felt so jumbled throughout the entire runtime. It tries to be so intellectual and complex but at the end it didn‚Äôt succeed at it. Overall Tenet wasn‚Äôt as great as I hoped for but, big and sometimes fun action scenes, good acting, sound design, and the look of the movie are all positives for Tenet. Maybe I just wasn‚Äôt smart enough to appreciate all this movie had to offer and that‚Äôs unfortunate, but I did have some fun with Tenet and think most people will enjoy it.",none,,2021-02-20 17:47:11.920285,0

The tour guide (if you will) is saying basic introductory nonsense, so the music gets louder for cinematic effect.

While Batman begins was an okay movie, it kinda sucks as a Batman movie and is not on my list. Dark Knight and DKR are shit for Batman movies.  Inception was on par with Memento but none of the characters are very likable, which brings me to my problem with Nolan. His movies are all about the set and the world and his characters come in a distant last when it comes to set up.
 Nolan did the story for Man of Steel... How do you make Superman even less likable? What a shit movie. That's when I seen it. Nolan is M.Night Shyamalan with a Batman movie that people liked. Of course Interstellar proved my point because that movie is DOGSHIT.  I've never seen such a waste of time and money. Since then I don't bother with Nolan movies and to be honest, I think I've saved myself some money. Nolan-fans try to sell his movies to the masses as something cool to watch but always with a cringy look on their face as if they are wasting some other person's time and money 05:00 and they feel bad. Like they know... just burning the money for heat is better than giving it to Nolan. 
  I'm not saying he shouldn't be able to make movies... Just not 200 million + movies. Nolan is more of a 40-80 million dollar director. Maybe he needs to head to Netflix for the next decade where he can pop out 5 or 6 $50 million dollar movies before giving him another shot at something over 100 mill. 
  At least Warner Bros can claim the movie lost money because of Covid and not because it sucked a bag of dicks.",none,,2021-02-20 17:47:12.629604,0

It feels like he cares less and less about people btw. The characters becomes more and more stale and it gets harder to hear them. Christopher Nolan loves loud bangs and he wants to make sure that everyone hears them. Fuck what people say in the movie. His next movie is going to be about robots that can't talk and backwards Michael Bay explosions.

Anyway, I saw this movie two times and I enjoyed it more the second time.

Trying to rate his movies based on my memory:

2. Inception
3. The Prestige
4. The Dark Knight Rises
5. Batman Begins
6. Memento
7. Tenet

The first half of the film is entirely set up but I feel that it has good paceing due to a few action scenes and the hallway scene you mentioned plus (no spoilers) that incredible motorway sequence. The second half of the movie is pure Christopher Nolan fever dream which makes it feel like his other movies, especially Inception with the tension and use of music to convey stress. This second half is - in my opinion - flawless. However, the first half of the film is validated if you watch the film for a second or even a third time. The multiple viewings make the entire film feel like a Christopher Nolan epic that is up there with inception, The Dark Knight, Memento, etc. Anyway I agree with your review but only from a first viewing perspective.

However it did make it very fuckin easy to predict how the film was gonna end, if you have watched most Nolan movies or a lot of cinema at all, you can sorta just call each and every turn of the film, which isn't necessarily a bad thing but at the same time it is very hard to follow If you were to go to the toilet per say, feel bad for anyone who dashes to the toilet for 2 mins to only miss half the important shit 

And with the audio mixing id say that Nolan probably does the who diagetic sounds and soundtrack overpowering bullshit to disguise unnecessary dialogue and is trying to make you pay more attention to what's on screen as opposed to what the characters are saying

It's great but not without its flaws.

If you want the full Tenet movie experience, just like I saw it in theaters this summer, DO NOT, DO NOT turn the subtitles on when you watch this movie. Obviously, Nolan did not want you to fully understand this movie the first time you see it. It is meant to be watched again and again, understanding more each time. When I was watching it in theaters, because I couldn't understand the dialouge and even the action was confusing, I realized it was all intentional. Once you see this movie, you will BEGIN to understand it. Watching in the theater, I couldn't wait to see it again, and I knew I couldn't understand it until I had my own copy to turn on the subtitles and watch and re-awatch certain scenes.

I liked Washington in Ballers, but he was more comedic there. He really did sell leading action star here, definitely someone should give him another shot at a lead action role. Patterson, he barely held his own at the supporting roll against Washington, despite having more dialogue in their scenes, as he was the expo dump/ dues ex machina. The dialogue between them felt stunted, and I didn't feel that way with Washington's other scenes, so I have to assume the issue was Patterson. I definitely am not interested in a movie based on Patterson lead, at least not yet, so Batman's is a no for me based on him being the lead, can definitely wait for video. I doubt Tenets box office will hurt anyone involved, as it outperformed everything else mid pandemic. I would be interested in a prequal/sequel, but it feels the story has already been told and the trick has been played, I'm not sure how they make it feel fresh for a second movie. I bet if Nolan gets a Bond film, the bad guy has a time fetish. In a way, I think Nolan is wasted on Bond, unless they are trying to reinvigorate the franchise, seems like both Nolan and Bond are at comparable levels, doing similar things, so merging them won't be bad, but won't significantly improve eithers stock. Nolan can make his fresh Bond clone, like Tenet/Inception and it will still do on par with Bond, while Bond can use a cheaper director, and do nearly as well as a Nolan helmed Bond.

I'm sorry but I found this one of Nolan's weakest movies because as good as the concept and visuals were, it was completely undercut by the motivation of the villain. They literally found a way to invert and communicate back and forth through time and with all the possibilities that you can explore with that concept, you go with a guy that's terminally ill and wants to use it to destroy the world?! Like not even rule the world, literally destroy the world and everyone in it because if he can't live no one else should be able to--how on earth are we to buy that even his own henchmen would go along with this? His upper tier henchmen knew what the end goal was and they're all just fighting to die for one guy's delusions? We've seen such plots from lesser films, but I expect way more from Nolan. 

It would be like if Palpatine was somehow terminally ill and instead of having the empire ""rule the galaxy,"" he told them to destroy the rebellion and then when they're done to go commit suicide because if he won't be alive to see their victory, none of them should be. Once word got out that was his motivation, the empire itself would have rebelled against him. 

I normally enjoy Nolan's twists, but this one felt like he passed off explaining the villain's motivations to M. Night Shyamalan üòï.",none,,2021-02-20 17:47:16.240916,0

The third act was particularly stupid with a faceless battle with no real tangible threat (not one you see at least). Elizabeth Debicki's character is shallow and literally defined by her relationship to her husband (the villain) and her son (her character motivation).

It feels like forever ago when I saw it in the cinema. Saw it in Australia where theatres reopened in August. As much as the sound mix is really horrible and it did make the movie a little more difficult to follow I'm still glad I got to see it on a big screen. It's really all about the spectacle more so than any other Nolan film. The actors and consequently the dialogue are just a necessary evil for him to put these amazing visuals up on display. It does lose quite a bit on the smaller screens so I knew where Nolan was coming from when he blasted HBO Max. I'm not an anarchist either. As soon as they announced moving their 2021 slate to HBO Max I was bitterly disappointed. Since I can't and really don't need to get HBO Max because everything except their movies I can get on one of the streaming services here I'll see a few of their upcoming movies at the cinema. We're lucky enough to have pretty much gotten rid of covid here. I only want to see a few of their films anyway.,none,,2021-02-20 17:47:16.896589,0

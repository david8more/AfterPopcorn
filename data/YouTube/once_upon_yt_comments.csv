The fact is the viewer doesn't and shouldn't go into this film looking for a tense riveting narrative - the subject matter is the Hollywood industry, it's not Inglorious Bastards or Kill Bill. There's more than enough tension in the film anyway and as for the 2nd act you're knocking on - that has the now iconic ""Spahn Ranch house"" scene with Cliff and the creepy Manson acolytes and of course the hugely satisfying climax at Rick Dalton's house. The film was perfectly paced. Are you saying you want tension and high drama stress in your films for 160mins? Inglorious Bastards wasn't like that either inbetween the moments of extreme violence. As what you say, I don't know anyone that has seen this film and thought it was boring, you ought to give your fans more credit if you believe that. People that go to watch this film or types of it are genuine lovers of film and will fall in love with the long gone era of late 1960s Los Angeles that's brilliantly depicted.

As the plot unfolds casually, there is always this lingering presence of Sharon Tate, who embodies that tension because most viewers at least have a vague knowledge of what happened to her historically (at least I would hope so). It made it so that for me personally, it was impossible to fully relax into what I was seeing without a slightly uncomfortable feeling in the pit of my stomach. I can't agree with your assessment of the Spahn Ranch scene being ""blehh"". The buildup is wonderful and the release is a subversion of the million things the viewer is expecting and dreading happening to Cliff. It's actually one of my favorite scenes, personally.

I was 18 in the summer of 69 and the Manson family murders really shocked the country.  In the pre-internet era we weren't inundated with 24/7 real crime news stories and there were very few mass murders then.  So I felt a low voltage tension right from scene 1 in the theater.  Knowing Tarantino's penchant for graphic depiction of violence didn't help.  Being immersed in the sights and sounds of the late 60's again was kind of a thrill and Quentin's choice of tunes was fine.  So, strapped in for the ride, it was just a question of how much the director was going to manipulate the viewer leading up to the horrific crime.  What you saw as a comedy film I saw as a slow, uneasy descent to hell.  The whole thing was like being in a roller coaster ride that you were told in advance had mechanical issues.  I think Tarantino made the film assuming the audience had some historical grasp of the gravity of the crime on which the movie was premised.  That throws a whole different  perception of the yellow brick road of songs, quirky characters, and humor he adorns the film with.  The brief smile flashed by the Charles Manson character summed up the movie for me.",none,,2021-03-08 16:47:30.062738,0

The audience sees Brad Pitt more than the character. So I don't understand why Tarantino had to turn Bruce lee into an asshole so Brad Pitt can mock and beat him. All of this may not have mattered if there was no negative Asian male stereotyping in Hollywood, but that is not the case. Asian male stereotyping has been around for decades – Asian men are bad guys, weaklings, foreigners, or kung fu characters. And now Tarantino had turned Bruce Lee, who had tried so hard to rid those negative Asian male stereotypes, into a jerk who got his ass handed to him by a white male sex symbol. Tarantino should have consulted Shannon Lee beforehand, but he didn't give a damn. It would have been a great film, but that scene killed it for me.",none,,2021-03-08 16:47:30.062952,2

I have little contextual knowledge about this period, but I don’t feel like the film did enough to convey this. Maybe it does if you really read into it. There are characters like the husband and wife of the production set, that perhaps symbolise this. 
Your insight towards the end, about how we have been trained to want everything right now, that every scene needs purpose is a really telling one. I think this may be a reason why we may struggle when watching this movie. There are however, other factors, and I think your right on tension. This film has none of it. 
. Characters feel like they are going round, without any fear, precondition or urgency, everything is so chill, so relaxed, theres no plot in this film, theres no struggle. There are no stakes, and its because of this that the film can at times be quite taxing. 
There are however, moments when the movie really shinres. Leonardo’s story, from falling during his first audition, to picking himself back up and succeeding is one of tarantino’s most poignant ever scenes and could be the mostmoving of his scenes. 

P.s ‘its an argument for the Hollywood star’. Nice insight.",none,,2021-03-08 16:47:30.063013,0

THAT SAID, JUST TO ADD TO ONE OF YOUR POINTS WE ALL LOVE MARGOT ROBBIE. IF YOU DON'T, YOU GOT SOMETHING WRONG WITH YOU... OR YOU JUST SHE'S AWESOME FOR OBVIOUS REASONS I HEART TONYA WILL GIVE YOU ONE SIDE OF THE SPECTRUM, AND JUST EVERYTHING ABOUT HER WILL GIVE YOU THE OTHER SIDE... THAT SAID, BACK TO MY POINT. WELL, ACTUALLY TO YOUR POINT... WHAT'S CRAZY ABOUT YOUR POINT IS THE QUESTION I'VE ASKED MYSELF NUMEROUS TIMES. WAS SHE EVEN IN THE ORIGINAL SCRIPT? CUZ AS YOU AND I BOTH KNOW TARANTINO GOT A HANDWRITTEN LETTER FROM MARGOT ROBBIE ABOUT WANTING TO BE IN HIS NEXT FILM. REASON I BRING THIS UP IS BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE FILM WHEN DICAPRIO IS SAYING GOODBYE A CLIFF WHEN HE'S GETTING OUT OR ONTO THE AMBULANCE AND DRIVES AWAY....(I HAVE A FEELING YOU KNOW WHERE I'M GOING WITH THIS! LOL.)
... DUDE! WHERE DO WE SEE SHARON? THAT'S RIGHT! WE DON'T! SHE IS OVER THE INTERCOM FOR THE FRONT GATE! DARE I SAY... SHERATON WASN'T IN THE ORIGINAL WRITING FOR THIS AND SHE WAS JUST LITERALLY A THREAD AND OR THE SPIRIT OF THE FILM AND WE LET THAT SPIRIT LITERALLY LIVE ON AFTER THE FILM DUE TO THE CHANGE IN DIRECTION IN QUENTIN TARANTINO'S UNIVERSE. SO YEAH, I WAS STUCK WITH THAT AFTER I WATCHED IT I WAS LIKE MAYBE THIS WHOLE THING WAS WRITTEN IN AFTERWARDS AND HE JUST HAD FUN WITH IT BECAUSE YOU KNOW SHE WANTED TO BE IN IT AND OBVIOUSLY AFTER HE MET WITH YOU KNOW SHARON SISTER UP IN SANTA BARBARA AND DISCUSS THE FILM AND THE WAY HE TOOK IT AND WHERE HE PUT HER IN THE FILM THINGS COULD HAVE WENT ONE WAY OR THE OTHER SO ANYWAY I COMPLETELY AGREE TO YOU WITH YOU AND I THINK THAT THAT INTERCOM HAD A LOT TO DO WITH JUSTIFIABLY CONCRETING THAT THEORY.

DONE RIGHT, that's important, you also see them trying to just get you on their side with references, basically just stealing fame from original content... and that's where Tarantino exceeds. His stuff is also often just an homage, but perfectly implemented and mostly not just pop history that's probably getting recognized by a target audience but rather actual stuff he seems to appreciate. And then he doesn't even throw it together like you except it, it's rather random at first glance, but it just works so good.

""Inglorious Basterds"" was an absolute masterpiece, but this one....just think it hadn't been made by Tarantino - how is it perceived then? So, it's obviously important, WHO does a film...but for me, it's a pretty mediocre semi-comedy, which doesn't have much interest for its own characters and with a lot of stuff leading nowhere or that isn't even needed to show or tell anything - and concerning the craft, Tarantino himself has done FAR better things, and there are many other directors out there, that do much better - Ari Aster, to name just one...so, in conclusion, I think that even Tarantino-Fans (which I consider myself to be) will be a little bit disappointed by this one, and,yes, it hurts to say, but I think it's his worst film so far....",none,,2021-03-08 16:47:30.975449,0

Tex was just on a horse. The red head had a few scenes, but no lines or focus on her. Up until the end you have zero idea that she's important at all. The blond was still just an extra even at the end. I feel like they should've focused more on the Manson family. Build that tension as the night draws closer. I loved Brad Pitts character. That was a great storyline. I wish the movie had just focused more on the central plot of the coming altercation at the end.

I just watched this the other night and found it an incredibly boring, 5/10 movie. Good performances, yes (Pitt was phenomenal, Leo was great, and that little 8yo girl was fantastic). Good cinematography, yes. Good script, yes. However, Margot Robbie's character was incredibly underused. And why was so much time spent on multiple scenes that went absolutely nowhere? The final 10 minutes of the movie should have come 30min earlier. 

*Examples...*
When Sharon (Robbie) went into the theater and watched her movie, why did we have to sit and watch that for 10min? Or when Cliff drives, why do we have to see everywhere he goes? Or when Cliff went to the Manson farm, why was there all that build up for some big reveal to just have it lead to nothing? Or when Cliff and Rick spend a good 10min sitting in front of a tv, examining their performances in past roles, why did we have to watch that?

Don't get me wrong, I love a good slow-burn movie when it's executed well. I just found myself more frustrated with scenes that acted like they would go somewhere, and then just drop off.

The artistic value of this movie is high, despite the obvious celebration of the rich, the white, and the bourgeois - which unfortunately forms a central theme. Despite these distasteful elements, this is for me a great movie, and belongs up there with Birth of a Nation.  Chris is wrong in suggesting  that the performance of Margot Robbie was supefluous: She represents beauty and innocence. The scene where she is in the movie theatre and puts her bare feet up....!

This comedy drama is Quentin Tarantino at his best. It's fresh, original and tragically funny. It's a beautifully finished period film, mixing history and fiction in a cool entertaining way that is also thought provoking and even inspirational in the end... Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is a montage of life in 1969 Los Angeles, and its huge expanse of city life and urban sprawl. It focuses on seemingly disconnected characters whose lives end up converging together in an epic way... Sharon Tate, a real life character, was at the center of the movie start to finish. So, of course the actress who portrayed her had to be in the movie! Chris. What did you want, an all-guy movie?.. In the end the fictional characters of Rick and Cliff came to her rescue, which rewrote history, and it was the best feel good moment I've experienced watching a movie in a long time. I hope to see more rewriting of tragic history in more movies... Chris brought up all that time spent at the Charles Manson ranch, and how it seemed to go nowhere??? IT WAS THE CHARLES MANSON RANCH. Cliff definitely WENT somewhere, Chris, and I didn't fear for the Bruce Dern character. I feared for Cliff... My God, if Cliff discovered a dead George Spahn, that would have been the end of Cliff, and the movie. So were expectations subverted?.. NO... CLIFF PAID A VISIT AT THE CHARLES MANSON RANCH surrounded by brainwashed maniacs. Expectations exceeded, right there, and that was before Cliff beat the shit out of one of those hippie pieces of shit, and drove out of there alive in his friend's beautiful 1966 Cadillac coupe DeVille... Tarantino had a very clear vision, and he put this movie together methodically. Nothing in the movie happened for no particular reason. Tarantino wasn't just goofing around with the camera one afternoon in L.A., spending many millions of other people's money, just having fun... Chris, can I ask you something?..

His ability to write good dialogue is usually the main reason. In ONCE UPON A TIME IN HOLLYWOOD, the main reason is how the actors deliver their lines. Not that they were badly written or anything, but there are no memorable quotes. Fred Raskin's editing is weird (and not in the cool way it's intended). Kurt Russell's narration comes and goes without any rhyme or reason and, several times, he redundantly mentions a date or time while an on-screen text is showing it. Whenever a period piece shows archive footage to provide context, it normally takes about 2 seconds. That's enough for the viewer to recognize the clip. Here, they're shown for much longer. In some cases, the scene from a movie or TV episode is almost played in its entirety. I know Quentin likes to pay homage, but there's no point in that if it's going to ruin the pacing. Not to mention that his strenght is taking elements from other works and adding his own style. Let's play a game. Imagine placing the climax of INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS onto PULP FICTION. It wouldn't fit, right? That's this movie in a nutshell. We get over 2 hours of different people who are somehow connected doing all sorts of things without that much plot progression, but time flies by thanks to the writing, directing and acting. There's even a very long sequence about a fictional TV show. I was so invested that I kind of forgot I was watching actors playing actors playing characters. I will say that the tone and especially the camera work and editing felt too modern for a TV pilot in 1969. Anyway, the climax is an over-the-top gore fest that reveals that this is an alternate timeline. It's fun to watch, but a ""This was just a slice of life"" ending would've been more appropriate. Unlike I.B., there are no layers of depth (like the bittersweet irony of a person sacrificing themselves to kill Nazis without killing the specific Nazi they wanted to get revenge on) or an ambiguety on how the future will be affected. It's a revisionist fantasy for the sake of it that has a clear outcome. The villains experience a violent encounter, but it felt to me that the women received a more brutal treatment than the man. Coincidence?

Spoilers: Personally, I really enjoyed the film and it's casual vibe (I was expecting a lot more scenes, an Inglorious Basterds kinda pacing), but I don't think it had enough depth to justify the run time.

They could have made the ranch scene shorter and cut some other stuff and the very insulting Bruce Lee scene, the narration was weird and the narrative too loose.


 The acting by Leo and Brad was top notch, one showing struggle while another showing swagger and Margot brought a certain innocence to Sharon's role but I wish she had more to do. Leo yelling while sipping a margarita was hilarious. Even the supporting performances by the Manson family members were amazing. 

The last 20 minutes of the film and that fictional twist was interesting. On one hand, the idea of a sweet ending where Sharon and her friends survive that horrendous incident would hit any viewer right in the feels. On a humour basis, Brad vs. Manson Family was the best scene of the film. But at the same time it seems like the movie manipulates you, because you're bearing through the slowee scenes to see how Tarentino deals with the murder scene. But he replaces it with this crazy fight scene and gives a fairy tale ending, which also seems like a cop out somehow.

Overall, certainly not as good a Tarentino film as Pulp Fiction or Kill Bill, but better than Kill Bill vol. 2 and Hateful Eight, it's up there with Djnago Unchained and Inglorious Basterds.

I did have to explain a few things to daughter (notably the whole Manson thing) but we both had a great time enjoying the film coming from two different age perspectives.  She is a die hard Tarantino fan. I felt tension all the way thru as I was expecting the gratuitous blood and hyper violence he's known for.

Cliff's visit at the old movie set was actually low key very thrilling and suspenseful. I expected someone to die.

Quentin, I love what you have done here. This script sings a love for Hollywood that leaps off the page. I like that you're changing history again and I think that this mixed genre thing you've got going on could work really well.

I do have some issues however.

One of the things I look forward to in your screenplays are the hidden coincidental connections and clever foreshadowing of events to come. e.g - ""Garcon coffee!"" or ""Pai Mei taught you the five point palm exploding heart technique?""

I know you really wanted to do 'a day in the life' of these characters, but the lack of connections between these stories makes for some uninteresting set-ups that never quite pay off.

1. Steve McQueen sets up the relationship between Jay Sebring and Roman Polanski, but we never see or hear from him again.

2. Bruce Lee and Cliff Booth fight, but we don't get a resolution?

3. If the Manson Family gets killed before they murder anyone, Charles Manson will never be implicated in the murder and he will still be out there.

4. Jay Sebring is clearly trying to get back with Sharon and Roman is cool with him hanging around all the time?

5. The Western TV show with Rick was cool, but he goes and acts in a Sergio Corbucci film we never see?

Now, I'm no Oscar winning writer, so take this with a grain of pepper...

What if you scrap the TV Western scene and convert it to a sequence in Italy showing Rick working with Sergio Corbucci on Nebraska Jim. Nebraska Jim is a success and when Rick comes back on a high, he finds an invite in the mail to Sharon Tate's party.

Rick and Cliff Booth head to the party, and as they walk up to the gate, Bruce Lee and Steve McQueen pull up in a red Ferrari (I am sure you know this, but they were good friends in real life. Bruce was his trainer and Steve was an accomplished martial artist). Bruce and Cliff have words before they speed off up the driveway and into the party.

At the party Jay Sebring spots Rick and they have that interaction you wrote at the end where they talk about his body of work, showing Jays appreciation for Rick as an actor. Sharing their mutual love of pop culture, Cliff, Rick and Jay become friends and make some drinks together.

Steve McQueen and Bruce Lee chat to Sharon Tate when Roman Polanski comes bursting in pissed at Jay for trying to steal his pregnant wife.

Outside the Manson family members (Tex, Pussy, Sadie, Patricia and Linda Kasabian) pull up with Charlie in the driver's seat. They all smoke acid dipped cigarettes (except Charlie, who pretends to).

Charlie runs them through his plan once again, making sure everyone knows what they have to do. They get out of the car and Linda Kasabian has second thoughts. She makes a run for it, leaving them with a part of the plan missing - Charlie now has to go in with them.

Jay and Roman are about to get physical. Rick and Cliff stand on the side of Jay, and Steve and Bruce side with Roman.

It's about to get nasty when Sharon's stands in the middle trying to break them apart. They start to fight, Sharon's water breaks and she goes into labor.

BANG! A gun fires in the air and five Manson family members (Including Charlie - who is holding the gun) walk into the party.

Charlie gives one of your famous monologues about his distaste for the entertainment industry, and the Mexican stand-off begins.

In an awesome Kill-Bill-esk kung fu fight, Bruce, Steve, Rick and Cliff take down all the Manson family members.

Only Charlie remains. He's had the gun the whole time, but has shown his true colors and been too afraid to use it.

Bruce, Rick, Cliff and Steve all begin to converge on Charlie. He who knows he's done for, so he turns the gun on himself and pulls the trigger - CLICK! he's out of bullets.

In a Death-Proof-esk ending, Cliff, Rick, Bruce and Steve take him to pieces.

Sharon gives birth, and Roman and Jay make up.

In a post credits scene (because they're all the rage these days) we see Rick, Cliff, Steve and Bruce working together on Game of Death - The movie Bruce Lee never finished.

Just a suggestion.

Hope it goes well for you.

Peace.",none,,2021-03-08 16:47:32.256201,0

Honestly, with regard to your point on the lack of tension in the second act - many many points in the film (for me) almost felt like he was toying with many of our expectations of Tarantino’s films. 

Take the old house scene you talked about that ends a bit deflated, it gave you the feeling that CLEARLY something was GOING to happen...and it’s going to be BLOODY and SINISTER. But....actually - “oh so cynical! She was telling the truth! Were you expecting violence??” I got the image of him laughing at us while we watched, expecting Tarantino style violence. 

Then.....the end..............GOOD GOD. I was approaching discomfort with the level of violence. Especially with who the majority of it was aimed at in today’s climate. Like it was a “OK, here you, here’s the violence you’ve been waiting for! Don’t complain! This is what you wanted!!”

I just got the feeling at so many different points that he was really having fun and using our expectations to his advantage. It felt like a film that was almost more for his entertainment than for ours (in reference to those points, there was obviously more to the film than that).

Still, good review, as per usual 👍",none,,2021-03-08 16:47:32.256339,0

But overall I loved it. The sumptuous filming and wry humour. I burst out laughing and slapped my thighs during the climax. Not sure I was supposed to. It was just so great. Pitt just gets better with age. I never rated him, but now I do.

Everything after they enter the house feels somewhere between Inglorious Basterds and Death Proof.

Brad Pitt has never been better. The swag, charisma - he steals the show. My favorite performance from him. *Inglorious Basterds and Snatch right behind.* 

I think this is my favorite DiCaprio performance, too. In some scenes, he’s playing a character playing a character. He’s a very talented and convincing actor. Excellent job.

We all know Tarantino loves Bruce Lee - he’s paid tremendous homage to him over his career. 

*spoilers* People are forgetting that Tarantino shows Lee training Sharon at one point, and it’s more to his peaceful nature... but nobody brings this up. 

The pacing is slow, towards the middle, but picks back up. I personally didn’t mind the slow pace, at all. I loved the dialogue. 

The ending, oh my god!!! Woooo!!! I loved every minute of the ending. Very brutal!!

 *SPOILERS*

In this case, I strongly disagree with you on two points. Firstly, as far as Act Two, I found it incredibly anxiety producing, almost as much as the last scene. Secondly, Sharon’s character is not incidental. Tarantino almost makes it sound like he wanted part of the film to be an homage to her life and what was stolen from her. That is why he chooses to portray her as a sweet, regular person, doing regular things any of us might do: dining out, listening to music at home, hanging out with friends. Even if I hadn’t heard Tarantino talk about her so affectionately, I kept thinking, over and over, how heinous her murder was, especially in contrast to her sweetness.

They're different films but share some plot elements (idiotic characters caught up in a sinister plot carried out by... other idiotic characters)


But I disagree in the tension aspect. Every time I saw Margot Robbie on screen my mind was split feeling ""Wow, she's so cute right now"" and ""If all goes well, she's going to be horrifically murdered"". And that was all the tension I needed. It's true that plot-wise her character does nothing to advance the plot, or to escalate tension on her own, but the mere reference to Sharon Tate and the fact that Robbie played her as a total sweetheart was what build up so much tension in me. And the sweet, sweet release of tension in the last scenes made it all worth it. Great film, loved it to death.",none,,2021-03-08 16:47:33.061488,0

I just came back from the movies, talked with my girl all the way back home we both love Tarantino MPs but some how I was disappointed by this one. In your review you say that is ok that It’s laid-back how ever in other movies you have the tendency to pin point cardinal mistakes from certain movie standards. Here I think your a bit over protective. I think this movie was “Lazy” to say the least... it was well acted yes but besides that I think it has no impact or message that author has made us used to in the past. I take it as a failed attempt to do some thing differently what he for sure was trying nothing more that that, if narrative was supposed to be concentrated on Brad and Leo characters I think there was no chemistry between them... if you think hard on it the only  thing that comes to my mind is the title “ once  upon a time... “  Hollywood is some thing that we perceive as dream of a different world and maybe just maybe author was trying to tell us that things are not always so perfect as we normal folks tend to imagine, but if so i think construction of the movie was not well build. In my opinion 6/10 or C+/B- in your nomenclature;) all best !",none,,2021-03-08 16:47:33.061593,0

Personally, the first of these worked really well, but the second one relies too much on Tarantino assuming the audience already knows what happened to Tate. The better version of this tension-building process is when we see Manson as he visits the Tate house, because it’s the only time we see him despite his weight hanging over the rest of the movie (a bit like the shark in Jaws was my first thought). And the ever-present Manson women all over LA probably achieves that tension-building better than the Tate stuff. Probably the sequence of Tate in the cinema could have been cut, but then again it did allow Tarantino to get some prime feet shots, and we all know how much he enjoys those!",none,,2021-03-08 16:47:33.062118,0

The first 8 minutes of this review is a synopsis of Tuartino's early works more so than being about one film.

I typically do not waste my time with most films coming from Hollywood today. The majority are lowest common denominator dreck force feeding political drivel by the spoonful. I do enjoy Tarantino's work and was in the process of going to see this film. 

Thankfully, I watched your review before I purchased tickets for my fiance and I. You see, I was under the impression that this film was about the Manson family. Unfortunately, I was wrong about the content...this is not the film I came to see. I chose to forego seeing the movie and we are opting to game the rest of the night. We are huge gamers that love all things gaming. I hear the Grandia Collection calling my name!

What's truly frustrating to me is the missed opportunity this represents....As I near the completion of my masters in criminal psychology, I truly would have enjoyed seeing Tarantino's take on the Tate and Labianca murders. I have little interest in old Hollywood action stars. Perhaps when this film makes it to Red Box I might be ready to watch.",none,,2021-03-08 16:47:33.416003,0

I think she (Sharon Tate) actually was this character who all the tension was gravitating towards to throughout the whole movie. Cause both 1 and 2 acts of the movie were dedicated not only to explaining to us who Dicaprio’s and Pitt’s characters were, but also to introducing us to the Manson family and this cute innocent pregnant young actress who’s whole existence seems to radiate with cuteness. And we all were watching this thinking “she’s gonna fucking die”. 
And that is another great aspect of this movie - that duality of it, as if we were simultaneously watching a 90s slasher kind of buildup mixed with a truly hilarious comedy. 

So imo exactly the fact we all were watching this movie being completely sure Tate was gonna die adds so much to the final fight scene. I personally wasn’t expecting that right until Pitt gave a sign to his doggo. I was like wtf!?",none,,2021-03-08 16:47:33.416091,0

Tarantino is out to make the feminazi's complain about violence to women who actually did kill Sharon Tate and her unborn child.

All the tension genuinely built in the scene of the ranch flows into nothing and it leaves the spectator lost. Also, it would be great to see Rick's own problems interact with the rest of the ""story"" . It seems like this character has his own lineal path and nothing fundamental touches him, there are no revelation, no transformation, nothing. It seems to be that there are well defined and made characters, like Cliff, with interesting frameworks but they do not change each other, they do what their nature rules them.  In addition the roots wich should support the final part have no been developed... this scene would have gone the same way if it would be happened at the beginning of the movie! In addition there are too much focus in cultural references and history. They are awesome and interesting but they eat all the attention. A film needs more to survive than that.  I think this story has an incredible potential to develope a movie with deep well-built characters, great music, great tension in Tarantino's way and great background but it has been wasted.

This movie is probably more for the folks in Hollywood than general audience but man, the dialogues just go on and on, it drags for such a long time and the so called “climax” of the movie seems to be added just because there should be some blood since it’s Tarantino. I get that his style is a mash-up but in this case instead of looking like a beautiful quilt, these pieces fell apart and did not look well together. 
Also, idk how he managed to pay respects to Sharon Tate because honestly, she is such a 2d character, who is just obsessed about herself, going off to watch her own movies.

Correct me if I’m wrong, but in my opinion Margots character was a kind of trick. Tarantino did 2 things at the same time. One of those things was historical  meaning as you mentioned in your review. But the Second one was more tricky. As a viewers we assumed that we all know what will happen. By putting Margaret in those meaningless situations we were thinking about her last moments. Something similar happened in “ Fast and furious 7” (Furious sevenI believe🤔), with Paul Walker... R.I.P
And of course the tricky part was later.

At first I didn’t know how I felt about the ending but the more I thought about it the more I fitting I thought it was. The one reservation I had with the film was that the lack of strong supporting characters . The thing about this film is , is that there is a lot of characters played by great actors but they are literally cameo appearances. I mean actors like Bruce Dern , Steve McQueen, Luke Perry , Dakota Fanning and Kurt Russell (just to name a few) all have under 3 minutes of screen time. For a film with so many colorful characters I would have liking to see more them more developed and give more contribution to the plot or even the development of Rick and Cliffs characters. Also I don’t know how I feel about how little Charles Manson is in the film because on one hand I think Tarantino doesn’t want to make the film about him but on the other hand I think it would have added more tension if he had more scenes.",none,,2021-03-08 16:47:34.235291,0

Which means we get to see 60s Bruce lee which is awesome and establishes Cliff as a superhero (he wears a tshirt that says champion on it for most of the film) the scene merely establishes Cliff as a badass.

1: This is probably the only Tarantino movie I have no desire to see again.
2: This movie is probably/unfortunately dependent on the audience having the knowledge of what actually happened to Sharon Tate.
3: I will pose that this entire, long film is about 1 moment. The flip.


All of Tarantinos movies have violence in them. As far as I remember all of the violence in earlier movies is either funny, justified or both. This one is different.
As the movie went on, and especially when the 4 mansoners drove up to Ricks estate I was dreading the finale. I think partly because all of Sharon/Margots scenes have been innocent and happy. I didnt want to watch the ending, and I honestly thought Tarantino would just make a historical movie and show us the murder. I dreaded it. The violence or the expectation of it felt horrible and wrong.


Then they enter the wrong house, Brad/Cliff greets them...and the movie flips for the first and only time. Instead of being horrified at a stupid and horrible murder....we cheer as the villains are slaughtered. I dont think I have ever experienced an expectation be flipped that fast and that brutally. 


Also...in the aftermath I was thinking of what the manson girl said in the car. ""We grew up watching TV and it taught us murder. Lets murder the ones who taught us murder"" Or something like that.
The ending of the movie have Rick being invited up for drinks at Sharon. The only ones suffering from violence in this picture are the violent villains. It might be a bit on the nose, but that felt like a message to me.


It was quite a thoughtful movie, but also less engaging than most Tarantino flicks. The setup was very long, with less payoff than usual. That might have made the last payoff (the flip) be felt that much stronger, I dont know. As usual it was something unique. But when you know the flip, the entire movie kinda loses its luster for second viewings. Like the sixth sense. And its too long to be enjoyed more than once I think.",none,,2021-03-08 16:47:34.236711,1

Like killing Hitler and thus prematurely ending World War II in Inglourious Basterds, Tarantino rewrites the Manson murders here, and I just don't know what he's trying to say or do when he makes such historical changes. It's one thing to present actual events in a twisted Tarantino way, but it's another thing entirely to take an eraser to it and say ""Nah, it didn't happen at all"" when we all know what happened. The Manson murders and the aftermath also reflected the change in Hollywood in that era, but by altering those events, it almosts feels like Tarantino is negating those real-life cultural changes, which would in turn seem to negate Rick Dalton's career struggles throughout the movie, which is the primary focus of the film.

This is definitely the best of Quentin Tarantino's recent output and stands head and shoulders above all out there now.
This is a film that can easily be watched multiple times, so layered and so much detail
Tarantino is that guy that sat glued to the TV and there are so many references to shows that he devoured, some say that the Rick Dalton character was partly based on Pete Duel from Alias Smith and Jones, who battled with depression, alcoholism and eventually died of a self inflicted gunshot wound to his head. Rick Dalton in a soliloquy threatens to blow his brains out after messing up his lines due to consuming eight whiskey sours the night before.
A rumour is that Gene LeBell did in fact manhandle Bruce Lee on the set of The Green Lantern, substitute Cliff Booth for Gene mixed in with a bit of Paul Newman and Hal Needham, who was Burt Reynolds stuntman and you have Brad Pitt's character.
Acting in this film is off the charts, forget about Margot Robbie not having many lines what about Roman Polanski one of the most influential Directors ever, I think he had one sentence in the entire movie.
Scenes and Dialogue have not been wasted in this film, would be interesting to know if Tarantino will release a Directors Cut with material that has been cut from this particular film.
I for one would pay to see it at the Cinema
The scene where Brad Pitt gets up on a roof to fix an aerial, hardly anything happens but rather like the entire film it is riveting.
This film really is a love letter to the forgotten people from the film & television industries in the Sixties & Seventies and I cannot wait to see it again.

Since Jackie Brown, every time Tarantino has put out a film I've gone to see it ASAP (save for Deathproof, which I didn't see in the theater) because I know a) I'm going to get more than my money's worth and b) I'm 100% guaranteed to be fully entertained. He's not exactly one of my favorite directors of all-time and I don't (currently) own any of his films (that VHS copy of Reservoir Dogs saw a lot of action from 1994-1998), but he is most consistent contemporary director and his love of cinema is palpable. He makes films for mature movie lovers with a dark sense of humor without delicate sensibilities, but somehow my dad seems to enjoy them as well. *shrug*",none,,2021-03-08 16:47:34.628965,0

Tarantino is famous for subverting the expectations cinema has built into us, and with this film, he subverts the expectations of what we've come to expect from him. The Spahn Ranch scene is one of Tarantino's best because he keeps us locked to our seats with incredible tension because we expect a terrible outcome. And he keeps twisting the knife, stretching that rubber band from when he arrives at the ranch to entering the house to beating up the hippie. Tarantino knows what we expect from a Quentin Tarantino film, and instead of delivering what we expected, he gives us a loving, thoughtful, endearing, and tender portrait of an era that ended tragically. It's the last thing we'd expect Tarantino to make, and it was brilliant in all the right ways. And I fundamentally disagree with Stuckmann's statement that this isn't Tarantino's best movie. It's very much his best movie, but in the same way that The Social Network is David Fincher's best movie. It's his most well realized film, in every aspect, from the directing to the writing, to the acting, pacing, and soundtrack. It wont be his most influential film, same with Fincher (Pulp Fiction and Fight Club respectively take those spots), and most likely not even his most enduring film

*SPOILERS*

(something the movie comments on with the ending conversation between Rick and Sharon and Jay Sebring), which Tarantino is clearly aware of, but that doesn't mean it isn't his best work. Tarantino himself even stated that this film is his magnum opus, and I'd be hard pressed to disagree. It's a brilliant, inspired, near flawless movie that, at the very least, reminds us of what movies should be and is a true Hollywood masterpiece, something rarer and rarer since the 70s. All in all, the best film of the year so far, and should be respected as Tarantino's best as well.",none,,2021-03-08 16:47:34.629007,0

All i know is i saw this film. Amazing actors, amazing acting, great setup. All these great qualities for no narrative??? Hmmm. It was a breath of fresh air to get something so different and “rule breaking” but i wouldn’t say that necessarily makes it a good film. It was more entertaining than mid summar but it came close for me! Mid summar had all the qualities to be a great film but because it was lacking in its plot it wasn’t..so what makes this different? Because that was its purpose? Idk dont get me wrong film is art on its OWN. But it definitely comes from literature, and thats why it has that cliche of following a plot and a narrative and following the “rules” because thats how you tell a good story and keep the audience involved. Can you write a GOOD book with no narrative? If it wasnt for brad pitt and leonardo dicaprio i probably wouldnt have cared for this movie at all. Because everything but them was senseless and pointless. The only thing that seemed to follow through throughout this movie was their friendship so i found myself rooting for both of them.

Don’t get me wrong, I throughly enjoyed the film but I had no idea what I was getting into with this Tarantino film. I watched the trailer right before entering the theater, not that I need a trailer to see a fucking Tarantino film but just to dip my feet and prepare myself. 
Another friend with me told me that Charles Manson was involved in a small way. And that’s where the movie went right over my head. My knowledge of Charles Manson is slim to none. I know a little, straining the little, about Charles Manson. I knew he had a cult following, I knew about satanic murders and whatnot but I’ve never seen a documentary and I’ve never read up on him. 
So I’m watching the film and I’m watching the character of Sharon Tate and I have no idea why she’s in the movie. Im waiting and waiting and waiting for these characters to cross path, which SPOILERS, does not happen until the end of the movie. And I’m misunderstanding what the plot is, and especially what the end goal of the movie is. The ending happens and it was amazing in every Tarantino way and the characters finally interact and the credits start to roll. I’m thinking “that’s it, all that buildup for him finally to get his old stardom back and we don’t get to see it?” 
It was like I was waiting the whole movie for the movie to start, y’know? So I called my dad because he wanted to hear my thoughts before he watches it. I explain my grievances when he explains to me that in real life, everyone was killed by those Manson cultists. Without that knowledge, all the tension with Margot robbies character was completely lost to me. I didn’t get it because I didn’t know about the real life event it’s based on. That kind of bugs me because he’s doing the same thing with Inglorious Basterds by retelling history but unlike inglorious basterds, I had no idea what history he was retelling. It severely impacted my enjoyment and understanding of what this movie is. Because I was watching it thinking everything was fiction, not grounded in some form of reality. Don’t get me wrong, my lack of personal knowledge is by no means the fault of anyone but me, but I wish someone would’ve told me what this movie was actually about, which the trailer didn’t give me, so I could’ve done some research. So I could’ve learned about the brutal murder that Tarantino decided to rewrite. I still thought it was a great film but if I could change anything about my first viewing or anyone’s first viewing is to learn about the murder the movie is leading toward because without that you’ve got no tension and, from my perspective anyway, no story.",none,,2021-03-08 16:47:35.040946,0

When they show her full term pregnant and kept showing the dates my skin was crawling.  Then all that massive potential energy built up over two hours gets converted to kinetic energy when Pitt smokes the acid and DiCaprio yells at Tex.  This gives you a huge relief of tension to the point where you enjoy watching two young women be beat to death by two of the biggest actors of our generation.

I liked how not everything in it was important to a later scene.  I didn`t see anything in the movie I didn`t like.


Why does a movie have to follow the 3 act arc ,have everything in it be an important thing for the plot and have to have charactor growth. Don`t todays moviegoers want movies to reflect real life more? Well , In real life , people see and experence stuff that in no way relates to later events. People experence random events that don`t lead to a special direction and , in real life, even in events of great impact people often stay the same as they did before the event.",none,,2021-03-08 16:47:35.041759,0

Saw it the other day; it was particularly ironic, sitting in the theatre, listening to the audience laugh away at the ending, while (I'm assuming), most (a young Taiwanese audience, in my case; but I imagine this can apply to many of the audiences that will eventually see this film) not knowing the actual history of the event that this film precludes ... it's not a ""happy ending"", but rather the ""beginning of a horror show"". That feeling was interesting throughout the final 'showdown' scene, as I didn't know when or whether Brad Pitt's face was going to be blown off, or Francesca get gutted ... kinda freaky queasy feelings in my stomach...
I guess the climax could be seen as a foreshadow technique to the horrors to come.But again, without context, what then is accomplished, except the graphic act in itself? And, despite Tarantino's obligatory ""style"", I think if that was the objective (a foreshadow technique), it could / would have been accomplished much more subtly with even greater effect (as, in my opinion, evidenced by the Spahn Ranch scene).
But then, it could be that Tarantino is simply providing alternative history (a parallel universe) where the Manson Family murders are in fact thwarted, by the actions of that night over at Dalton's house... ??? And it IS a ""happy ending"", after all.
But if that's the case, why? We spend 3 hours waiting for his ""joke"" ending? That's a little self-indulgent, even for Tarantino ... Why not go full-bore fantasy land, instead of such exacting detail in all other accounts of that period of TV and film specifically, and L.A. generally?
In the end, a ""story"" still ought to be a ""story"", in any art form. I think Tarantino lost the ""story"" in this one somewhere along the way... maybe even from the beginning, just in order to justify his ending, which seems to have come first to his consciousness.
(There's mention on the film's Wikipedia page of Pitt originally being cast as the investigating officer of the crimes ... Wait, WHAT? So the crimes DID happen; or DIDN'T happen; or ... Ah, now there's some potential evidence of Tarantino no being sure himself as he was developing the script, leading to the mess that I'm describing here!
""and that Pitt was in talks to portray the detective investigating the murders."" - Wikipedia Page)
Beyond that, if one isn't old enough (or researched enough) into that particular time period (let alone the cultural gap I refer to regarding sitting in a theatre full of young Taiwanese of which I'm guessing the vast majority can't even relate to Sharon Tate and related murders history the ending hinges on!), then despite the craft of the acting, directing, cinematography, et al, most of the film's script (thus significant humour) would simply be a complete waste of time and effort and energy and commitment and ... 
Now, (I guess ???) luckily, I did grow up watching Manix and Lancer, Steve McQueen and The Rifleman, the influence of spaghetti westerns on pop-culture, reading Kid Colt comics, etc. So I (like others of my generation) can appreciate the innumerable humorous references written into the film. But I couldn't help understanding as I sat watching this, how many people wouldn't. Again, is the film made to appease Tarantino's self-interests and indulgences? Obviously, to a great degree.
But here may lie a valid critical argument: Make the thing and stick it in your basement then. Or show it to some buddies / peers who are going to get it, even. But is that art? Is ""art"" self-indulgence, or is ""art"" a means to communicate something to an audience? Tarantino seems to think the former is far more important than the latter. And to me, it's to a fault.",none,,2021-03-08 16:47:35.456361,0

It was long, slow, and one of the most boring movies I've ever seen. It was mostly talking, and occasionally stuff happens. Also, I had no clue about the whole Sharon Tate thing, and I think it's a point against the movie for expecting the audience to know about real life events in order to understand it. Having watched some of Tarantino's more action-oriented movies prior to this one, it was also a severe disappointment.

""Once Upon A Time""


That right there should subvert your expectations you're not going to get what you think and that's what makes Quentin top tier as a director, he slowly built up literally everything for the finale and it payed off.. We were always told that the Manson family were monsters and evil beyond belief, whereas Quentin wanted you to have the two main heroes not GIVE A FUCK and be able to make them their bitch.. I fucking loved that, I loved that Rick and Cliff were so far and away capable of quick thinking! Why? Let me explain


Rick Dalton was in the movie constantly obsessing over small details, he tried to remember everything important and constantly loved re-watching and re-living his movies.. So what did he remember when the moment came to life or death? ""Oh yeah! I got a fuckin flamethrower prop from my Nazi movie!"" Absolutely loved how Rick was really in a way a genius.

Cliff is a man with absolutely nothing to lose, The Manson family fed on fear and they became confused and frightened by Cliff's nonchalant attitude to even the most tense situations.. He was, in a way, their kryptonite because he wasn't even in the slightest afraid of Bruce Lee so do you think he would be of frightened by a bunch of loser psycho kids? Fuck NO! 


The more I think about this movie, the more I'm in a awe of the way Quentin built tension only for it to go nowhere most of the movie and why is that? Well it's fiction! The title makes it clear that this is a happy ending kind of movie, our heroes make it out alive and do it with style. 9/10 for me and from a creative standpoint I think it's a highmark for film.",none,,2021-03-08 16:47:35.456930,0

The movie dragged for the first 90% essentially and I was super confused with the brutal ending.  It wasn't until my husband explained that there were the Manson murders in 1969 that I realized what a gem the film really was.  The movie seemed to me like a character study of these two men whose careers and lives are burning out.  Rick says he feels useless, like he doesn't add anything to the world, and his stunt double is essentially in the same situation, only even worse because he's also about to lose his job of driving Rick around.  Even the audience gets to a place where we almost stop rooting for Rick, especially because he's kind of a tool.  And then, bam, these two characters who are deemed ""useless"" inadvertently stop this major Hollywood murder that, as someone else in the comments said, essentially brought about the end of the Golden Age of Hollywood.  It's the most epic, ""What if?"" because it doesn't ask you to believe that Rick and his stunt double are heroes -- they're a hot mess like most of humanity -- but in that moment, they change a horrible event in history.  Moreover, Tarantino didn't just kill the Manson murderers.  He had their demises met in the most gruesome ways possible.  There's no question as to who the villain is, even if Rick is the asshole for most of the movie.  Someone else in the comments said that it's Tarantino's middle finger to the Mansons, and that's exactly how I watched it.
So, on the whole, the context really does it for me.  The movie was long and tedious, but the payoff was incredible.",none,,2021-03-08 16:47:35.457299,0

She's crucial for building tension, crucial to show why its worth being an actor in the first place, and she evens out the emotional core of the film by giving some space from Pitt and Leo's darker story line. If she wasn't in the movie, the ending wouldn't have worked and people would've said it was disrespectful to Sharon Tate. If Tarantino did give her more of his sort of dialogue, people would've said it was disrespectful too.

The cinema scenes with her are probably the ones that had to carry the most narrative weight in the film (Yes, even more than any of Pitt or Leo's). It's subtle, but it develops her character, sets up stakes in relation to who we'll lose when the historical events happen (since most people know the murder but not who she was), shows why it's 'worth it' for actors by juxtaposing with the scene of Leo flubbing his lines and going off on himself, her interaction with Bruce Lee inter-cut with the scene is used to balance his portrayal since the first one was negative but necessary to set up the final confrontation's plausibility, and brings us away from the behind-the-scenes of Hollywood to see how it interacts with the world at large - which is later integral to contrast with how The Family believes Hollywood has affected the world. It wasn't a glamorous scene to act like Leo gets on the set of Lancer or Pitt gets in a couple places, but it's the scene that makes the movie work as a meta-narrative (which is the point of the film) and the other scenes with Margot Robbie are necessary to make this important scene work in the narrative. This movie would've been bloated with any more story lines to try 'giving Margot Robbie more to do' (which is dumb, she already accomplishes the thesis of the movie) and cutting Margot Robbie from the movie substantially would either make it not make sense or take away the broader purpose of the film.

I think people might not have had time to process the movie fully and that's why we're seeing so many people think Margot Robbie wasn't doing much. It's also a difficult scene to 'get' since it's done with next to no dialogue to contrast with the dialogue-driven scenes going on with Leo on the set of Lancer. It also doesn't help how the scenes with Leo on lunch break, flubbing his lines, then his 'dark Hamlet' scene are immediately gratifying in relation to Leo's character arc at that point in the story where Robbie's scenes are busy laying the groundwork for something that takes the entire film to pay off.",none,,2021-03-08 16:47:35.457674,1

Agree with most of your reviews. I have a bit of a bone to pick with you on this one. You, like 95% of the other reviews of Once Upon A Time....have misunderstood the role of Margot Robbie (Sharon Tate) in the plot. You say she doesn't have much to do. Or much to say. Maybe she's not important to the plot?


Her performance is critical. Her lack of dialogue is intentional. She is portrayed as the Icon of Hollywood at that time. She's a beautiful woman, nice to all and she serves as a bridge. She's the connection between the old Hollywood we see dying out & the new ""hippy"" style that is taking over. It would eventually die out itself but not before ushering in the 1970s. 


Too much dialogue for her would skew the viewer to have an opinion that perhaps she isn't someone worthy of being saved at the end of the film. Playing an Icon is difficult but Robbie pulls it off almost perfectly. We see her as totally sumpathetic. The audience going in, is probably going to know that she is a murder victim to the Manson family. Her portrayal is as a shining beautiful person WORTHY of being saved. Too much dialogue would probably spoil that. 


I agree totally with how Tarantino wrote that character.  It's similar to the decision NOT to show if Cliff (Pitt) really did kill his wife. We are supposed to bond with him throughout the movie so we can root for him the last 15 minutes. By not showing more of that scene of him on the boat with his wife, Tarantino is telling us that he probably did not kill her. He puts up with his bad reputation on movie sets because he doesn't feel he has to justify something he's not guilty of. I saw parallels between him & Tate in this film. 


She's above the fray. Dialogue would just bring her down into it.",none,,2021-03-08 16:47:36.198971,0

If you didn't grow up during this era of American culture, or if you aren't a major Hollywood scholar/mogul, you probably aren't going to get as much out of this movie as Tarantino's other works, even if you really love his work as a director and writer.
I'm 22 years old, and I went to see this movie with my parents. When the movie ended, I didn't really see what was so great about it, but after a conversation with my mom, who grew up during this era, I got a better understanding of just how important the Manson murders actually were to that generation, and how much they changed life and culture in America. For a lot of people who grew up around this period, the revision of the Manson murders that Tarantino pulls off is kind of like if someone made a movie thirty years from now about the 9/11 hijackers, and had them just miserably bungle the whole thing up and get their asses deservedly handed to them, leading to a cathartic happy ending that we sadly didn't get in real life. It's a revision of a real-life event that had a traumatic effect on the American consciousness, and Tarantino wanted to rewrite history to have a happy ending like in the old movies he loves, which is actually kind of sweet when you think about it.
Unfortunately, people younger than, say, 30-40 probably won't get much out of this. All the references and nostalgia would have little effect because it's of too early an era, and the revision of the Manson murders doesn't have the same impact for younger audiences because we've all grown up in the post-Manson murder world, where macabre violence and cynicism in both life and entertainment are both ubiquitous. We see mass shootings and murders and rapes and all manner of unspeakable horrors every single day, and we've never really known that idyllic world where people felt safe to leave their front doors unlocked at night. Going into it with this context in mind might help people appreciate the movie more, but most probably won't go into it with that context.
And really, even with all of that taken into account, it's still not one of Tarantino's best movies. It doesn't have the same innovation, energy, conflict, eclecticism, or imagination as his best works do. Granted, it still has a lot of those elements, just not as much as say Kill Bill, Pulp Fiction, or Inglorious Basterds. As a matter of fact, pretty much every element of this film, while still really great, feels watered down from his best works. And considering the 3-hour runtime on top of all of that, I can't say it's a movie I would see more than once.",none,,2021-03-08 16:47:36.199041,1

She is the example of someone who's just stoked to even be in a film. Even a small role, and a comedic role. She loved the slight reaction the audience was giving her in the theater. She was so happy to be in the Playboy mansion, and had a completely wholesome and innocent vibe the entire film. This to me was to contrast the difference in actors here. Leo's character is basically pissed hes no longer the biggest action star going and is trying to get a movie with one of the best directors in Hollywood and is still crumbling at the thought of only being a secondary character.

I believe the entire point of these seemingly meaningless scenes with Margot were to purely show the other side of Hollywood. Some people are genuinely excited to be on screen, be known by a small amount of people and are quite fine being a side character, which is exactly what Margot is in this film.

That being said, they certainly could have given her a few more lines at least. I think he did all of this purposely but I'm not sure it completely worked for me either.",none,,2021-03-08 16:47:36.598725,0

It's SLOOOOOOW as fucking hell, like for real, but it's amazing. Has possibly the best car-chase ever put to screen in episode 5, to the tune of Barry Manilow's 'Mandy'. It has Miles Teller, Jena Malone, John Hawkes and tons of brilliant unknowns. Instead of dialing down the style for a TV show, Refn turned up his style to *ELEVEN* . And its beautiful. I'd say the show has the closest resemblance to Twin Peaks more than with any of his other work, considering its co-written by the legendary Ed Brubaker, which means that yes, the show is also really darkly hilarious, just  watch any of the homicide division office scenes (theres literally a scene where the lieutenant gets the whole room to chant fascism, and later reenacts the crucifixion of Christ before feeding Miles Teller a pringle). Chris needs to watch it if hes a fan of Refn. The show is highly symbolic and ambiguous, and it's fucking brilliant, although the pace and dialogue style is very similar to Only God Forgives, which I seem to be in the 1% of loving that movie , so I guess most of y'all will hate it. The cinematography, directing and the Cliff Martinez score is typically top notch, all the characters are really interesting, including Billy Baldwin, who I had no idea was a person because how many siblings does Alec Baldwin have anyway? Go seek it out if you think you can handle the pace and style. And if Chris doesn't know, someone with greater power than I, please alert him.",none,,2021-03-08 16:47:36.599187,0

Some of the complaints like Margot Robbie as Sharon Tate not being important to the narrative, and the film lacking tension indicate they missed Tarantino’s point. Going into the film Tarantino expects us be aware in 1969 Sharon Tate was murdered by the Manson family and based on his previous work that murder will likely be the climax of the film.  This is foreshadowed throughout the film, like when we learn Rick lives next door to Sharon and how Cliff keeps running into one of the Manson girls, eventually taking her home to their camp.  Theres supposed to be a slow building tension as these things play out.  The natural conclusion is Rick and Cliff are likely to get caught in the cross hairs and more than likely be punished for their brazen disrespect of the Manson clan.  Rick in the driveway the night of the murder and cliff when he visits their campsite and beats up the guy who flattened his tire.  The acid dipped cigarette, Rick and cliff getting drunk. It’s all meant to create tension, for us to worry they won’t be able to put up a fight During the inevitable Sharon Tate murder scene. Notice how they put time stamps on the screen the night of the attack. We’re supposed to think this is a recreation of the real murder. Until the fairy tale reversal. Cliff runs into one of the Manson girls a few times and eventually ends up taking her to their camp. I felt this tension and sense of anticipation throughout the whole film. Then we get the beautiful and satisfying ending when he flips our expectations and cliff and Rick end up inadvertently saving the day and rewriting history.  Tarantino wants us to think this film is doomed to follow real life history with Rick and Cliff caught in the crossfire.  The film is basically a fairy tale (hence the title) where Tarantino’s fictional characters essentially have supernatural strength and ability.  Like how Cliff put up an even fight with Bruce lee. In real life Cliff would have gotten his ass kicked by Bruce. But here, these characters are like Tarantino childhood movie heroes.  He was 6 years old in 1969 and looked up these types of actors and performers (Rick and Cliff) like kids today look up to iron man and captain America.  So in this fantasy fairy tale his movie heroes have supernatural strength and ability.",none,,2021-03-08 16:47:37.003426,99

He racked up the tension further with Pitt surrounded in the living room in that state. When he gave his dog the whistle and started smashing the Masons, it felt so cathartic!

The quality of the dialogue in this movie had absolutely no rhythmic substance nor did it have any indication of foreshadowing or build-up to that big dumb ending put in there solely for subversion. Comparing this to lebowski is too much of stretch because in that movie the writing had enough rhythm between to keep the viewer engaged in what was otherwise meaninhless conversations.

It is not just a collection of scenes. OUATIH is about Tarantino's current struggles with aging, or his mid-life crisis. Despite DiCaprio playing an actor, he is supposed to be Tarantino of today; an aging artist in Hollywood who has passed their youthful heyday, is uncertain about their future, and doesn't know what to do next. Margo Robbie's Sharon Tate is actually Tarantino of the 1990s, a contrast to DiCaprio. Robbie, like Tarantino during the days of Pulp Fiction, is filled with happiness and optimism about the future. I think you have misinterpreted her character. She isn't required to do much other than to show playfulness (dancing at the Playboy Mansion) or happiness/joy (seeing her own movie on a screen).

The families of these victims, and I'm not just pointing to Debra Tate who it seems ""loved"" the film thinking Sharon was alive and vibrant. Makes no nevermind she is not the official Tate family spokesperson and she's clearly misrepresented everything her mother Doris, and little sister Patti fought for in terms of their work on behalf of crime victims. Tarantino also mocks the other family members like Leno LaBianca's mother who died within two years of Leno's slaughter all because she couldn't take the grief of what happened to Leno and not having her son in the world. Same thing with Steven Parent, the first victim the night of the Tate killings. He's not even represented here. But then what would an eighteen year old kid who was working two jobs to save  enough money for college in the fall mean to Tarantino? He clearly only saw fit to allow Debra Tate to read the script, while not giving any consideration whatsoever to Sharon's surviving husband, Roman Polanski. His third wife Emmanuelle Seigner was so disgusted with him she has posted a few times to her Instagram about the disgraceful way he treated Sharon and Roman. And Emmanuelle isn't the only one pissed. Shannon Lee, the daughter of Bruce Lee was never contacted to ask for her permission as the holder of the estate of her father, for Bruce Lee's image to be shown in the film.

But that aside, I think this movie is flawed from the get go because of casting. Honestly, I have no intention of seeing the film for that very reason. Maybe it's just me, but if I were going to make a film that was somehow connected to the Tate-LaBianca murders set in the late 60s, I would have an interest in realism and therefore cast my film with a bunch of relatively unknown, yet talented, actors. The casting of this film is absurd and it's like QT was competing with the Oceans 11 franchise to see how many A-list actors could be thrown together in one film. He's basically the A list version of Adam Sandler at this point. Make a film and cram as many of your Hollywood buddies (and in the case of Adam Sandler, total hack sports talk radio host Dan Patrick) into your film as possible, because.... reasons. Hell, since QT is down with Roman Polanski raping a 13 year old girl, and given Polanski's connection to the plot, I'm surprised there wasn't a Polanski cameo. Maybe even a comedic one. Because, you know, child rape is funny. Great review on your part but the fact that this piece of shit is still respected in any way in Hollywood absolutely pisses me off. For my money his last good film was Basterds. I hope like hell he sticks to his plan to make one more film and then disappear.",none,,2021-03-08 16:47:37.369874,0

The meticulous recreation of 1969 Hollywood and the brilliant sweeping shots Tarantino uses to romanticize it is endlessly fascinating. Tarantino finally examines the melancholy side of nostalgia and the result is heartwarming and powerful. It is not a movie for everyone. It’s a slow burn that’s deliberately paced but teases the inevitable shocking ending every step of the way. I loved it. A masterclass of direction. I do think it lacks Tarantino’s signature dialogue though. I needed my Jules/Vincent “Royale with Cheese”, “Foot massage”, “Walk the earth” scenes between Pitt/DiCaprio that showed their bromance on fully display. The movie also needed more DaKota Fanning (who is remarkable in her one scene), Margot Robbie (the heart and soul of the movie), and Margaret Qualley (explosively temptous and creepy at the same time).

 I saw the movie yesterday July 25th, the day it came out, first off I have not seen all the Tarantinos's movies only some, but I happen to think this one is a great one, keeps you entertained from beginning to end, I agree there were some aspects that sag a bit in the second act, but not enough to make you loose interest due to the nature of it's busy nature, but the key here is to make you forget about the piece of chicken you are about to put into your mouth. DiCaprio's acting??, let's say I smell an Oscar and the editing is just alright. To me the movie is kind of comical and that's what keeps it fresh, the movie is based mainly on DiCaprio's character (Rick Dalton) , with Pitt playing a phenomenal supporting acting role, Pacino's enjoyable few scenes and Margot Robbie as the sensual, lovable Sharon Tate, but her part doesn't really bring anything much to the plot of the movie, nevertheless just to watch her say ""klutz"" is good enough already. The casting is perfect just watch Steve McQueen being portraited by Damian Lewis. The only weak part of Once Upon A Time In Hollywood is the end, that albeit Tarantino changed reality and I accept it for reasons of respect, it was zoomed out from a robotic camera which leaves you wondering a little bit, now if you are product of the 60s like me, just listening to the soundtrack is worth paying for your ticket.

Stars are hugely important to making a movie marketable. If Tom Cruise does a movie, you have a pretty good idea of what quality it will be, for example. If there are no stars, it's much more hit or miss.
2. Tarantino has made good movies and terrible movies. Inglorious Bastards was a ridiculous and cringey, not that many people minded seeing Nazis lose. The Hateful Eight was a really lame movie with a lot of disturbing and cringey scenes.

Basically, Tarantino has a habbit of doing two things:  putting sick, weird, or disturning scenes in movies and making SJW wet dreams. Some horrible scenes that come to mind are the ear scene in Reservoir Dogs, the ball-gag/katana scene in Pulp Fiction, and the confederate oral scene in Hateful Eight. I could have lived my entire life more happily if I never saw those scenes. As for SJw wet dreams, the entire plot of Inglorious Bastards was a ridiculous fan service to Jews that want to have killed the Nazis. Django Unchained was similarly for Black people who wany to have killed slave owners. Not that slave owners and Nazis weren't horrible people, it's just SJW fan service and not particularly close to reality.

I saw this movie Thursday on the opening night and I have to say I think you missed the mark on the ""lack of tension"" for the second act.  There are not many scenes in cinema that get more creepy and tense than when Pitt's character visits the Spahn Ranch.  I hate to say it but I think that unless you are over the age of forty or have researched the Manson case in any serious way and perhaps also grown up with an appreciation for the shows of the 50s and 60s and Spaghetti Westerns then maybe many of the instances and tension points and nuances could be lost on the viewer.

[spoilers ahead] for example the scene where brad Pitt is on the boat with his wife. We never get payoff to that. Maybe it was meant so we can draw our own interpretation of “did he kill her” but why leave that up to us? It’s a vital character point and we as an audience have to decide if this guy is a deranged killer or not? We see Manson once but in the end it’s just his goons that come to kill them. I get that it’s probably more accurate that way but this movie is throwing accuracy away. At that point we should just never seen Manson at all and let him be a background figure. The guy at the playboy mansion watching Tate and being creepy never goes anywhere. I’m happy they gave te a happy ending but in this fictional world I want to see that “what if” scenario go further. I wanna see if she was never murdered how well does her life go. The one girl that stole the killers car and fled doesn’t do anything for the story except maybe because she left that’s why the other three failed but if that’s the case that only works for people who know details about the murders to an extreme detail. Everything with Margot robbies Tate was wasted for a misdirect. Clearly he wanted to set it up so we think we are attached because we think she’s gonna die, but she doesn’t and in the end she isn’t even involved in the final conflict, so what’s the point. If she would have been in the house when everything went down it would have made so much more sense why we would care for her because we would be afraid for her. But really her buying a book and watching herself in a movie and training with Bruce lee are all pointless scenes because her character is the equivalent of a family guy cut away gag. “Remember that time this lady got murdered” it’s pointless. I understand the point of this movie. I understand who it’s for, but fundamentally it is a bad movie. It has great moments, and if it just stayed focused on the main two characters and cut a lot of the unnecessary stuff, it would be so much better. Hell the ending scene was amazing but even it is just random. Why not have them coming as revenge that Pitt beat up their friend. That makes so much more sense why they’d attack that house. Instead apparently Manson gives them that order, but they ignore that order and go for decaprio for some reason. It’s just a mess and they should have cut the fat and stayed focused.",none,,2021-03-08 16:47:38.142693,0

Also, NO SJW nonsense to sit through!!! Thought Margo Robbie's talents were completely wasted. Thought the Manson Family was portrayed pretty well from everything that I have ever read about them. Probably best part of this movie was the 1960s music and remembering how everything looked back then - was 6 years old during this time frame and the scenery/clothing/language/etc. just brought all kinds of memories!! Plenty of cameo's as well. Again, an OK movie - definitely better than everything else that is currently out there.",none,,2021-03-08 16:47:38.143164,0

So the trailer to this intrigued me since  it's a film about film making (which is a thing I like) and the Charles Manson thing is there (which I'm fascinated by). So is it one of his 'homage' films (a reference Tarantino really doesn't understand judging from his other films) and does it have his annoying hipster dialogue, OR does it really do the REAL film thing? 
What I mean, does he really make a film (and preferably a slow one)? Not just a collection of stolen scenes stuck together pretending to be a movie?",none,,2021-03-08 16:47:38.495188,0

I think it’s fair to say that ten films is a good number to aim for and retire under for someone whom puts out three films on average per decade; not including collaborations with other directors (Sin City, Grindhouse).   So long as Quentin Tarantino is at peace with ten movies under his belt, then that is fine. Perhaps # 10 could be about the LGBTQ issue before it grew so much support.  Back when it was taboo.

I heard that and immediately one name came to mind. from the world of TV.. Matthew Weiner. a writer/director whose work has so many moments that feel like they are just there for the moment itself. not for the character / not for the scene or the plot or the narrative. they are just there. almost feels like those extended shots are there for showing that sometimes during or at the end of a shot - people behave in a very ordinary way and there is nothing really to see. nothing to take something out of it. but it's shot and he puts them in there for us to experience that inconsequential / insignificant scene or moment. I find it very different and beautiful. it just somehow adds more realistic life to his work. this used to be part of classic cinema alot. perhaps back then it was how films were made but people like Tarantino and Matthew Weiner understand the significance of something like that",none,,2021-03-08 16:47:39.687508,0

His whole career has become a giant, self-aggrandizing eye-roll to me. I can understand why people enjoy his films. He can write the hell out of a bit of dialogue and he creates interesting characters (peaked with Hans Landa and Aldo), but it all feels so superficial. Again, I understand why people enjoy his films, especially someone like Chris, who can appreciate the hmm... ""texture"" of Tarantino's film making, and that's enough to make the run-time spent on it worthwhile to him. 

But listen to the review. A second act that's meandering and potentially uninteresting, even lazy. Not enough build-up, a lack of tension. A character with major screen time whom Chris feels could be written out. Which to me is made all the more egregious by the fact Margot Robbie's character seemingly does nothing of import. She is literally just a pretty face for the viewer to gawk at. I can already see some of the pitchforks that will get raised at that. Sharon Tate was a rising star. She was a person. She had agency. She DID things. If Robbie's role in this is so inconsequential, couldn't it be argued that the use of Tate's name is a bit exploitative? If she has no bearing on the film, yet is in so much of it, then what was Tarantino trying to do with the character? After all, this was an intentional decision by Tarantino, but I wonder if it will back fire with some of the audience. I found this quote of him talking about how he portrayed Tate in his movie:

""Unfortunately, she’s kind of been defined by her murder. I thought the best way to get her across was not sticking her in a bunch of scenes with Roman or with other people where she’s [furthering] a plot, but just hanging out with her, letting her drive around Los Angeles, do her errands, and just see where the day takes her. I wanted to show people a glimpse of Sharon before the murder, so they think of her as more than just a victim.""

So my question is, could she have been named anything else and still have had the same impact on the film and by extension, the audience? Will people walk out and feel that Tate's been redefined in their minds? Or will they just think, ""that was a great movie, and Margot Robbie was beautiful in it but didn't do much did she?"" In short, will it MATTER that Margot Robbie's character was Sharon Tate? It'll be interesting to go into the movie with that in mind, see how it plays out.

Like with so much of Tarantino's film making, I understand where he's coming from and what he's trying to do, but I just don't know if his execution works. So yeah, I can understand the A- Chris is giving the film. It comes from an appreciation of Tarantino as a film maker, and the artistry on display in his films. But for me, artistry and a very apparent love of film just aren't enough. The same way that gratuitous violence masking a thinly veiled attempt at making a statement isn't enough for me with films like Django Unchained, Inglorious Basterds, or The Hateful Eight. The same way that his penchant for paying homage to his heroes isn't enough for me anymore in films like Kill Bill or Pulp Fiction. 

I've initially enjoyed most of Tarantino's films. But any examination of his films always makes me feel like Tarantino's just a pretentious dick, who's more concerned with painting himself as an edgy art house maestro than with actually making a good film. For me, there's just a massive disconnect between what he says about film (particularly his own films), and what his films turn out to be. I've watched all of his films multiple times, precisely because I can see nuggets of stuff that I really enjoy, even if the overall work just doesn't do it for me. Even if I hate his work in general, I feel that it still merits examination. There's a reason so many people connect with his stuff. I'm just not convinced that he's the master film maker that people make him out to be.

Though to Chris' point, I'll probably go see this movie just to see DiCaprio and Pitt work off of each other, if nothing else. As I said earlier, Tarantino can write some really great dialogue. So I'd be down to pay $10 to watch two of my favorite actors banter with each other. But I can already tell that while I'll probably enjoy the performances, I'm going to dislike the film overall. But who knows, maybe this is the one that hits the mark for me. I do enjoy hangout movies.",none,,2021-03-08 16:47:39.688561,0

There are plenty of movies like this that are much just “the adventures of these characters” that I like & work for me, but the pacing and really long runtime sort of diminished that for me, especially because we spend 30+ minutes in some scenes in the movie.

All of the acting was great, of course (Brad Pitt, I thought, was also the star), and it’s really funny at parts, but I just caught myself wondering, “Where is this movie going?” so much throughout it. Again, I don’t mind seeing a movie about... nothing, really, as long as it’s done well (some of Richard Linklater’s movies like the Before trilogy, Dazed & Confused, and Everybody Wants Some are similar to this style).

From the review it sounds like the humor is more ""real life"" rather than movie humor....meaning humor sounds like something you would laugh at if you actually saw/heard it happen in real life, but since this is a film I expect more.  I have a higher standard for humor in movies....to come up with a ""funny line""  spur of the moment in real life is difficult and therefore my expectation (what I will subconsciously accept as ""funny"") is lower.  But in a movie, they have time to craft and create and redo to make sure everything-- dialogue, phrasing, timing, etc is perfect and I expect that level of humor in my movies.  I could hear something in real life and crack up laughing...but if I heard that same line in a movie I might only give a little smile.  My expectations are higher for movies...I appreciate the crafting of the joke, and the art and care of crafting that joke is a huge part of what actually makes it funny for me.  Funny in real life is not nearly good enough to be funny in movies.

On the other hand, especially after seeing I, Tonya, Robbie has proven to be one of the best actresses of her generation, and if you’re going to have her in your film, it feels like a waste if you don’t use her enough. I think she will turn out like Pitt. People initially dismissing her as another pretty face, and she’ll eventually be a legend like him, proving she’s a lot more than that. 

As far as the film not being the typical Hollywood movie goes, I don’t care. I know that Tarantino is known for gore and stylized action, but after rewatching Django for the first time in a while, I found that the most memorable aspects were performances and dialogue. I had completely forgotten how bloody it got after the halfway point. It was still very entertaining, but I was caught off guard by how I wasn’t remembering that, but remembered lines and interractions.

He says that we are accustomed to watching good cinemas these days where  every scene has to mean something. And he used this observation to defend Tarantino's unusual style of film making. It is kinda ironic because Chris usually is highly critical of movies when they are slow and boring.

But if you're not, all you need is a place or a situation and BOOM, you have your setting to write scenes for.
Robert Altman's Nashville is about a time and place and the country music scene in the 70's, but what's the film about? A political rally in Nashville and all the press people and
various odd characters who happen to live or show up there. That's it. And it's regarded as a masterpiece.
Or what about some of Fellini's films? La Dolce Vita, 8 1/2 and City of Women are based on nothing but feminist, absurdist and satirical ideas, but they're absolutely spellbinding as
Marcello Mastroianni bumbles his way from surreal scene to outlandish situation. 
Tarantino may not be able to quite reach those heights himself, but I suppose that's a bit where he's coming from. His new film is more about a time and place, rather than a specific story.

I enjoyed a few scenes, like the scene with the little girl who was kidnapped for ransom. The acting within acting was amazing. When he steps out of the second layer of acting, Leo made the first layer of acting ( Stepping into Rick's character)  felt like  stepping into reality. I call it ACTCEPTION. And the ending of course was sort of redeem much of the aimlessness of the movie in the first 1.5hrs., especially when you know how the actual murder  went down. It was cathartic.

If they get confused by the art they believe it's great rather than being honest. This movie was great as another rule breaker from QT and the way it was shot. And man QT gets the best out of every single actor in it. The little girl was maybe one of the best ones and I have no idea who she is. 
Everyone who grew up in the 60/70s feels the vibe from it and that was probably the best thing about it. QT really went all in on details and the way people behaved. People were very different back then and much more direct, offensive and in your face than now, as people now are more subtile, sensitive, passive aggressive and harder to like. Making it harder to trust anyone than back then. Most likely because of the internet. Anyway, watching this movie made me feel a bit sad because of that. It made me miss the 70/80s and wish we never got internet. It has kind of screwed us all up a bit, becoming more stressed and weird and I don't know if I will live to see people relax again like in my youth. To younger people this movie won't make any sense. But to us over 50 it makes a lot of sense even if it actually doesn't. It's hard to explain. I wish QT had done some things differently as he had all this talent and money to make this movie. So in a way it feels a little disappointing after I watched it. Like an opportunity he screwed up by getting arty farty. Still a good movie you should watch, if only to maybe understand how things were before internet. One of his best technically. But it is far from his best movie, story wise. 6/10.",none,,2021-03-08 16:47:44.047136,0

You watch some of his films and it feels like almost every single person walking down the street is a suspicious evil twisted motherfucker. Except for this film which, curiously, has a lighter tone. Also some scenes are way too violent, as in, you can almost hear the heavy breathing of Tarantino himslelf masturbating to the trauma unfolding in the scene, but without a necessary counterpoint of beauty or emotion to balance it make it all work as a grand story. Basically he is, or seems to be, a nihilist (which is okay) that has delved to deep into ""the darkness"" when filmaking and doesn't siccessfully balance that with ""the light"". I don't remember a single emotional scene in his films. Even though I haven't seen them all so I can be wrong, but not one of the films I did see has got me. Not even Pulp Fiction, which I also find overated. Many if his films are hardass characters, weird dialogue, weird funky/rock music, and of course violence.

I'll probably get lectured about cinema and all that, but it's just my thoughts.

I never said he was bad, just overated.",none,,2021-03-08 16:47:44.047493,0

Someone told me OH YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT SHARON TATE YOU NEED TO KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT HER TO LIKE THIS MOVIE!!!  Not true...I feel like this movie was about two guys nearing the end of their movie careers as actor and stuntman respectively and the twist ending was a nod to Sharon Tate and what happened on that night.  I think it would have been more effective, personally, had they left out all the scenes with Sharon and just made the ending a nice ""holy shit"" moment for the end of the movie for those who know.  So yeah...I went in thinking it was a play on the Sharon Tate murder and kept waiting for her to sink more into the plot and that didn't happen.",none,,2021-03-08 16:47:44.048199,0

The guy died because of an aspirin ffs, you have to end this myth. Any type of cult of personality is something harmful in my pov, Bruce Lee is a case that has gone out of control a long time ago. The man was really arrogant, there's several reports about it, what he talks about in the movie is also well documented, etc ... Similar to Ali, who was also a jerk who sold himself as a badass, but Ali went out there on national TV and really fight, he broke his jaw, almost died in the ring, ended up with a neural disease for life, etc ... Bruce Lee doesn't even have a video showing the guy really fighting, there's zero evidence. We only have legends and myths.

Teasing .. that's what merges the scenes together, it's the common theme, and the actual plot of the movie. All the dialogs are just character building and preps for the final scene. I like it a lot.
It depends heavily on if you know about Manson's case or not. Which, outside US, is a huge problem. But all I knew was that Sharon Tate was killed by some hippies, and that's all you really need to know.",none,,2021-03-08 16:47:44.515512,0

Some good bits in the film, I like the pace, have no issue with the length, think the acting is good, love the sets... but none of this means anything when a film has nothing to say. Like, making me wait two hours for a childish revenge twist is not good enough. 

I haven’t had a problem with the other Tarantino movies, they feel like more complete works, even if some are much simpler. 

This film relies on building suspense to something that happened in the real world and changing that history - it’s just... uninteresting.

My fav part was when he was on set filming the scene where Leo is playing a villain and holding the little girl hostage. Totally a Django unchained villain type performance coming from him. Anyways they cut the scene and everyone praised Leo for his performance. His Co star tells him that's the best acting she's ever seen. This hits Leo's character hard since just the night before he had a total alcohol induced identity crisis in his trailer feeling like an unraveling ""has been"" and thinking wtf am I doing. Anyways this girl's simple comment to him brings him to tears on set because it was just what he needed to ignite the tiniest spark he had left in his confidence. 

This scene choked me up since I feel like I can somewhat relate. I'm 31 years old with a wife and 4 year old daughter. I recently completely uprooted my 10 year, somewhat established career to start a new one as a software engineer. I'm in the middle of a 12 week full stack development program and thinking to myself wtf have I done. Learning html, css, SQL, python, Java, JavaScript, Ruby, rails, vim all within 12 weeks.

Spoilers: Personally, I really enjoyed the film and it's casual vibe (I was expecting a lot more scenes, an Inglorious Basterds kinda pacing), but I don't think it had enough depth to justify the run time.

They could have made the ranch scene shorter and cut some other stuff and the very insulting Bruce Lee scene, the narration was weird and the narrative too loose. Considering that their big selling point is the ending twist, the movie could have literally started at 2 hours, once Rick and Cliff return to LA.


 The acting by Leo and Brad was top notch, one showing struggle while another showing swagger and Margot brought a certain innocence to Sharon's role but I wish she had more to do. Leo yelling while sipping a margarita was hilarious. Even the supporting performances by the Manson family members were amazing. 

The last 20 minutes of the film and that fictional twist was interesting. On one hand, the idea of a sweet ending where Sharon and her friends survive that horrendous incident would hit any viewer right in the feels. On a humour basis, Brad vs. Manson Family was the best scene of the film. But at the same time it seems like the movie manipulates you, because you're bearing through the slowee scenes to see how Tarentino deals with the murder scene. But he replaces it with this crazy fight scene and gives a fairy tale ending, which also seems like a cop out somehow. The film would only work if you actually knew about the Manson family murders, otherwise it falls flat.

Overall, certainly not as good a Tarentino film as Pulp Fiction or Kill Bill, but better than Kill Bill vol. 2 and Hateful Eight, it's also inferior to Djnago Unchained and Inglorious Basterds.

When Charles Manson sends the hippies to kill the people there (arguably becaus of what cliff did) you see that they attack ""the wrong house"": in real life the hippies killed the pregnant Sharon Tate. In this version cliff stops the massacre (like brad pitt killed hitler in basterds) and that opens a possible bridge to polanski notice rick dalton. As said by Sharon Tate in the last line "" this is Rick Dalton, a wonderful actor"" and Rick has a line to polanski now.

To me it really needs the audience to know what was the fate of Sharon Tate. And it also need you to recognize the Manson girls in order to build tension and suspense. If you do not know these things, the movie is not going to tell you till the very end. Which I kind of understand why they did not want to put any focus on the Manson family. But being as it is, you are just watching the main characters slowly get closer and closer to something you do not know what it is and have no clue how bad its going to turn. I guess this will be like an audience watching Titanic without the first scenes where they are told its all going to be a big tragedy. And I got myself thinking how would Titanic play if they did not set up immediately what is at stake. How would Titanic work if you did not know its a tragedy in waiting. I think this movie would improve if it started with some first scene with people talking what a BOMB was the Tate murder. And then you could still go the way the movie goes because it would still be ""once upon a time"". But knowing that the main characters are going to get involved with something incredibly big would make the movie much more meaningful. Like...if you knew there are going to be a bunch of hippie girls who are going to turn into serious killers…..all those funny scenes suddenly become serious.

It's slow, that's right, but I wouldn't say that there's not tension. You need to know about Charles Manson and the murder of Sharon Tate by Tex and three other members.

So, when finally it happens... and it doesn't... you feel like if you were finally getting the joke. 

The movie is full of great scenes, great moments, and a the quality of the direction is absurdly high (like it usually happens with Tarantino movies). 

The only problems: The movie is really slow. The first hour and a half all you have is exposition. And for the people that know nothing about the murder of Sharon Tate... they probably won't get the ""joke"" in the end of the movie.",none,,2021-03-08 16:47:45.316506,0

The whole Manson part of the film and the last like 15-20 minutes feel like they’re from a completely different movie. Doesn’t fit with the rest and feels like he just needed to find a reason to have his trademark violence. 

Enjoyed the violence in it because it was great but when it has no place in this movie it isn’t good. A decent 6/10 film to me because the main story of the ageing actors was great and Brad Pitt and Leo are fantastic. Margot Robbie was completely wasted though and reduced to nothing but eye candy for the whole runtime.

This was not Tarantino's best, and it kills me to say that as one of his biggest fans. It had all the hallmarks of a Tarantino classic, but it just didn't have the plot to back it up. Tarantino is somewhat known for having flimsy plots loosely tied together by his unique style and the electrifying performances he gets out of his actors, but while this had all of that I just felt the film had no real direction until the end. I understand that to some extent the payoff of the end sequence is somewhat enhanced by the somewhat slow pace of the film beforehand. But, the fact remains that the film as a whole can at times be somewhat monotonous. In short, this is a good film, with amazing performances, quippy dialogue, Tarantino's unique visual flair, and it has one of the best endings I've seen in a film all year.

He tries to say this is to much of a Hollywood insider pat on the back movie about production meetings. The movie is called once upon a time in Hollywood sorry its not the next mcu movie. I mean there's that one scene with al Pacino but it's a great scene. Then he just goes that o but that one scene. I assume he meant the ending which i agree was fuckin amazing but every scene leading up to that was amazing as well. Although this is coming from the guy who gave the 2014 robocop remake a rave review and trust me its shit on film.

The good:

The movie was absolutely GORGEOUS, drop dead GORGEOUS.

The acting? I expect at the very least, Oscar nominations for both Pitt and DiCaprio. Unbelievable talent.

Dialogue? Some of the scenes will go on to become iconic and will be referenced for decades to come.

The bad:

Sloooooowww buildup. And I mean, painfully slow. Some people walked out halfway through.

Aimless direction. Where is this all going? 

Lacks that signature Tarantino craziness... except for like 10min of the over 2 hr long movie.

I'll be watching it again after buying it. I even debated on not adding it to my collection and I love Quentin and his passion for cinema. I never thought that I would see the day where I would come out of a Tarantino film and be disheartened, but I have come to that day. The film is basically if you sit down with Quentin for 2 hours and 44 minutes and talk about all of his favorite movies and the history of cinema and of Hollywood and, then, decide to make a movie about it. This is Quentin at his most Tarantino-ian. He has made a film about himself. This one is for the QT fans and no one else.

Seeing a Quentin Tarantino movie not be what you think it's going to be for most of it was a welcome surprise for me. Throughout the movie, the Hippies were unnerving to watch in how they were framed because I was not aware of the tragedy that the movie was leading up to and made all the tenser to watch unfold, especially with the characters not being portrayed as Super Badasses but simply flawed people. 
I liked the characters especially BWFF Cliff and his dog Brandy, Rick Dalton struggling with his place in the business was saddening to watch whereas a lot of people were laughing at him during his breakdown in his trailer I was watching with empathy.

He’s said Star Trek and he’s mentioned a Kill Bill sequel. If he is really only making ten films, it can’t be both, or maybe it can. So, I think I have it figured out.
A Kill Bill-Star Trek crossover, framed by the narration of Jules from Pulp Fiction while he wanders the world, talking to strangers (lots of cameos). There. Everyone can be happy.
Actually, with this set-up, it can be done and make absolute sense within Quentin Tarantino’s movie-verse. Remember, Kill Bill is part of his movie-within-a-movie world. So, as he has said, Kill Bill is a film characters from Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs would go see. Star Trek is obviously a known fictional universe. If Jules is narrating, he could just be making up a nonsensical Kill Bill-Star Trek crossover story with lots of campy martial arts fights and it wouldn’t have to make sense beyond that (try to imagine an Uma Thurman and William Shatner stand-off). It would just be Jules. No more. No less. Making weird shit up.
I would pay fifty bucks to see this film.
Also, this would free Quentin from any backlash from a miniature horde of angry Star Trek fans who may not dig an R-rated Star Trek film because it wouldn’t be canon anyway.",none,,2021-03-08 16:47:47.434073,0

Here are some reasons why:
1. It is not like the trailers. The trailers make it feel like a high energy homage, maybe tongue in cheek at parts, and using real events as a backdrop for the fictional characters to be a part of or influenced by. Not so much, the story progresses forward very slowly (intentionally) with so many long, drawn out establishing shots, and walks to and from cars, and worst of all to me (but others may love), car rides to highlight music from the decade. If you took all of the car scenes and songs, many in one drive to a location, you would easily have a youtube music playlist to jam to. I don’t want to harp on some of the other elements because they become a bit more plot specific, but using the word you used, it becomes a bit indulgent. Intentionally showcasing street signs, billboards, magazines, sodas, beers, cigarettes, anything to evoke the era and show that they were able to get it or recreate it.
2. It is uneven tonally. There are times where it takes itself very seriously and it works, introspective characters responding to their situations in believable ways. At other times it becomes over the top, which makes sense in the movie making elements, but when the real world of the characters and the almost slapstick surrealism intermingle without it seeming like it is meant to as a storytelling piece and more rather for spectacle, I don’t buy it. On the filmmaking side as well, there was a seen in which the dialogue was so quiet we couldn’t hear two characters discussing other characters from a far, but all of the music was suitably loud, so that was off putting, and in a conversation between two characters, there were splices, but they didn’t read as advancements in the conversations, but closer to retakes, but it was a “real life” scene. If that is the point, more power, but I both was able to tell that was the case nor did it work for me.
3. Things I did like: seeing the behind the scenes elements of movie making and studio which came across in the trailer. Actors dressed up as other actors. Some splicing of contemporary actors into older films. There is a great scene illustrating serious actor prep. The little girl was wonderful and the payoff fantastic. Leo was great, Brad Pitt was charming, but was basically a more physical Rusty Ryan (from Ocean’s Eleven).
4. Some final not likes: no pay off on a character backstory, some Family Guy-esque quick flashbacks that happen in the middle of events, multiple times of excellent tension building for a false conclusion. Ultimately, I think some people may love it exactly as it is. I may literally be missing the entire point of the movie and thus my complaints are coming from a place of ignorance. However, I think the movie feels bloated and excessive, especially when compared to its trailer.

So many films try so hard to attach you to a plot, it was refreshing to just be taken on a ride that in the end had a really satisfying payoff and made me love the characters even more. I get that the purposeless kind of direction isnt for everyone and the effectiveness of it does depend on the viewer having some knowledge of the murders, but the twist at the end is such a perfect subversion of expectations. It really becomes a buddy film with a fairy tale ending of a real tragedy, and the parallels it draws with reality are beautiful (in regards to filmmaking and ""making it"" as an actor). I left wanting to see it again immediately so I guess I completely disagree with you lol, I could watch it a hundred times more just for the awesome relationship dicraprio and pitt had and the growth they went through. Better than Pulp Fiction imo, which was already a purposeless film.",none,,2021-03-08 16:47:47.798936,1

He made us dread for DiCaprio as he walked up to the car. He made us dread for Pitt when he picked up the acid cigarette. He racked up the tension further with Pitt surrounded in the living room in that state. When he gave his dog the whistle and started smashing the Masons, it felt so cathartic!

Definitely worth a watch. It had a lot of good moments, but the biggest flaw with the movie was that it was too damn long! I felt like there was a lot of extraneous information that probably means something to critics and Tarantino, but to me just killed a lot of time unnecessarily.  The scenes with rick and the girl, the ranch, the final scene, and the overall vibe was great, but like what was the point of robbie's character? I understand that history has a purpose for her, but the movie largely didn't. It depends on you being knowledgeable about hollywood culture and history and if you are a bit fuzzy on details, the movie cuts you no slack. Ultimately, its a wild ride but its also a weird one that is funny, depraved, beautiful, detailed, and fucking strange.",none,,2021-03-08 16:47:47.800229,1

I get how the middle parts might’ve felt like fluff, but I thought it was interesting to see Quentin sharing something with the audience he clearly has a deep love for.

Let's be fair here. Tarentino is an indulgent filmaker. I'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoy Inglorious Bastards but when I was watching the movie I said to my peers ""This is the most indulgent movie I've ever seen"" because it had scenes of characters sitting around making small talk for long stretches of time before something would happen.

He has an incredible amount of pressure and expectations to live up to but I think his 10th and last film will be his masterpiece that gives you what you wanted in this.

Is it one of QT’s best? Time will tell... I believe many will NOT like this movie... It’s long, boring at times... There are a few ways to describe this movie. One that comes to mind is this... Ever have someone tell you a joke? A really long Joke? Halfway thru the joke you say to yourself “Get to the punchline already!”... or “This better pay off in the end!”... Well, the payoff at the end of this long joke is worth it... To me anyway... Another way to describe this film is to say it’s a film about nothing... You get to hang out with Leo, Brad... Margo... Not much happens... And then some shit happens... I feel like the initial reactions to this will be negative overall, but over time, It’s weird absurd story and QT excellence will put this film in it’s place along side all of his greatest. Brad Pitt is tremendous in this! He proves once again that he is one of the greatest actors of all time. Everyone else is very good... Leo did a great job as always and Margo Robbie is a shining star as Sharon Tate. I could watch the last 15 minutes of this film over and over on a loop probably for days! The soundtrack is typical fun awesome QT stuff... I’m thrilled to have finally sat in a theater and watched something special... Something original... Not a sequel... Not a big dopey action movie... Not a quirky little over hyped art film... A real old fashioned Hollywood classic with big stars and interesting characters. And that ending!!!!!! Holy shit!!!! So I recommend this for my film buff friends who really appreciate QT and fine performances... And don’t mind a little truth bending of historical happenings (ala “Inglorious Basterds”).

Oscar might be kind to Mr. Pitt, Ms. Robbie and QT of course, perhaps for original screenplay. Picture and Director will likely get nods as well.

Fun fact... If you ever saw the great film “Shampoo” with Warren Beatty, he played the real life hairdresser Jay Sebring who was Sharon Tate’s boyfriend, who has a substantial role in this QT masterpiece.

I loved the idea that while Leo was filming a Western, it was as if Booth (Pitt) was actually in one with the whole Ranch scene. Also, the foreshadowing of his actual fighting prowess during the scene with Bruce Lee was hilarious.

I also loved that by the end of the film, Leo’s character made it Polanski’s house. “I’m just one pool party away from being in a Polanski film.” Right when he thought his career was over and he and his Italian wife were going to settle down, his career may have only just begun. I thought that, and the touching moment between Booth saving everybody and Leo waving goodbye to him in the EMT was really touching and poetic.

I respect your opinion fully, JJ. Never mind what some troll idiots say and will attack you for not loving ANY Tarantino film that comes out. The trailers for Once Upton a Time in Hollywood never blew me away. It looks interesting, but I will be surprised if my reaction is ultra positive and I end up loving this QT movie as much as my 3 favorites. I still want to see it but I was always skeptical. Somehow, I felt either jeremy, chris stuckman or someone else would not be that invested with this pretentious experiment from Quentin T. 

Not exactly the response that many come to except from a Tarantino flick. Usually he puts out these gems that are purely re-watchable cult classics ie. Kill Bill, Pulp Fiction, Inglorious Bastards, Reservoir Dogs. Yet, even I have grown tired of latest pictures and I often stand alone on saying how he has sold out as a director. Thinking that his original and clever deconstructions on various genres are more original than bigger blockbusters. Depending on which major tentpole movies. I haven't truly loved a Quentin T film since Inglorious Basterds. I thought Django was just average. It's a really okay plot and over the top movie when you think about it. Hateful 8 is trash. I thought it was painful to watch 3 hrs of that lame af movie even one time through.   
There are so many times I can watch Leo Dicaprio play himself and brad pitt just being cool and himself? Whatever. Who cares. Why are we watching these? What is the theme, story and motivating force. If it sucks, I'll go back and watch Spider man FFH again anytime. Very good movie. I'll watch the Lion King, which I still didn't see yet.",none,,2021-03-08 16:47:49.796189,0

Some I get the sense they just don't give a damn.

Others I get the sense if they make a ""Jaws""-reference they feel they've made a ""deep cut"".

This will make me sound like an asshole snob (to some people...) but the truth is it's got nothing to do with me. Cinema is something I care about and it sometimes bums me out that influential voices on Youtube seem to not care that there are decades of films which exist, pre-""Jaws"".

There's over a hundred years worth of cinema to explore, and if you actually love the medium, it's a sincere reason to rejoice. Or should be.

1969 is 50 years ago...but in cinema terms, if you love cinema, that's irrelevant.

""Midnight Cowboy"" won the Oscar for Best Picture that year. I re-watched it a few months ago and that film will still hit you in the gut, hard. As much as any film released today. 

If 1969 seems like distant film history only relevant to old men with canes, that's...kind of tragic.

It's just, for every reference I see on a popular ""movie""-channel to Spielberg or Nolan (who are great) it'd be nice to sometimes also see a reference to Robert Aldritch. Or John Schlesinger. Or even Anatole Litvak.

I'll even take a stray Alan J Pakula every once in a while.

I just feel if you love cinema, truly love it, you should be enthusiastic (or at least curious) about its history. I don't feel I see enough of it on Youtube. It matters.

That said, Jahns is one of the few Youtube ""movie""-channels I watch, primarily because his enthusiasm and sincerity (and wit) are worth watching.

And I enjoyed his commentary on Collider Movie Talk.

Clearly Jahns doesn't possess a ""wealth"" of film knowledge, but that's fine. He means what he says and is genuinely clever. That counts for a lot.

It puts him lightyears beyond precious, posturing blowhards, humming with transparently unearned authority, like ""Your Movie Sucks"" and his...ilk.",none,,2021-03-08 16:47:50.640902,1

For everyone saying the Pitt / Bruce Lee fight was a dream, you're incorrect.  That was Pitt remembering WHY Kurt Russell won't let him on set anymore.  The distinction is that when Pitt drops Leo off, and Leo says Kurt Russell won't hire Pitt, that's for the Western he's shooting with Timothy Olyphant.  The flashback is for the Green Hornet show, which Leo mentions to Pacino he did a guest spot on.  Pitt is the stunt double for Leo on Green Hornet, where Bruce Lee was the co-star as Kato, which is why Pitt calls him Kato during the scene and Lee is wearing his classic Kato chauffeur uniform from the show.  So again, Pitt is remembering the last time Kurt Russell allowed him on set.  So when he snaps out of the flashback, he shrugs because he understands why Russell won't hire him back after that.",none,,2021-03-08 16:47:53.180302,55

So I think the main criticism of the Manson Family is more of an after thought, however I do agree. For starters Steven Parent I think his name was is completely cut from the film, who was in his car nearby and was tragically shot and killed. I’m not saying he should have died anyway, but at least a mention like you see him drive away or something. But also the fact that Pitt’s character was high, I do feel that they almost dishonour the real people. Jay Sebring who is the man talking to Dicapprio at the end (perfectly cast by the way), tries to defend and protect Sharon in real life and was killed for his efforts... Meanwhile the two stars do it pretty easily... turning it to slapstick. 
I think if Cliff or Rick actually died, giving their life to save the other and the people next door, it would have been better... Pitt is hospitalised but is obviously going to be okay, killing him off would probably make the Mansons just as dangerous as they really are, and instead of coming in for a good few drinks, he mourns to Tate and the others...",none,,2021-03-08 16:47:53.180337,0

The movie should have JUST been about Dicaprio and Pitt struggling in Hollywood.

What I understood is that the story is exactly what the title indicates; a  'fairytale' in the Hollywood of the sixties. ....SPOILERS AHEAD....   our two main protagonists are the underdogs with failing careers in a magical land where only few make it and in the end they save the day by beating the shit out of the bad guys and give us a Happy Ending to a story that we all knew did not have it as the people in Tate's mansion were slaughtered in reality.

Margot as Sharon seems vacuous and barely has any lines throughout. Can’t believe she didn’t object to any of it. Her role seems to be limited to smiling and showing off her legs. You’d never know this is the same woman who killed it in “I, Tania”. I think women’s feet has more to do with Tarantino’s fetish though (he famously had a thing for Uma’s feet in kill bill).

My first point I would like to make is I have heard many recounts of Bruce Lee's attitude on set and most of the time it isn't good he's cocky, he's ignorant, and self invested many martial arts experts have taken time to talk about how Bruce lee wasn't actually a fighting God how he was pretty good but he wasn't this legend that the movies (which I enjoy) make him out to be. 

Second I think that you need to understand that the movie isn't trying to make women seem any less then men it's about 2 men living in Hollywood in a world where the Manson's go to their house instead it's not a insult to Sharon Tate's legacy that they killed them and she didn't she was a pregnant women who was asleep and tied up in her living room with a drunk hair stylist and aspiring screen writer after they killed the heir to a coffee fortune not to be mean or anything but they arnt the most formitable bunch especially drunk as they were(besides tate) and the guys were buff action star/stunt double who had a flame thrower in their shed. Part 2 of point 2 the idea that it makes fun of women because she snores is crap because if she had been sleeping like sleeping beauty then it would have been holding women to a higher standard. By her snoring it is showing that even movie stars arnt perfect it's a movie about what holly wood was like of course people arnt going to sleep like angels. On top of this I can tell you from personal experience if you put on boots without socks on your feet are going to get dirty

Third point real quick the reason that Curt Russel doesnt liek Brad Pitt is because he got in afight on set with Bruce lee and threw him into her car his wife doesn't like that Pitt ""killed"" his wife because all people side with the character they relate to more Curt Russel's wife thought that he killed his wife because she was a wife. It's like O.J. most black people sided with him and white people thought that he killed his ex wife and her lover 

So those are my thoughts I hope that no one took offense. Grace I normally see where your coming from when you talk about this but here you just seem like your grasping at straws and out if your depth.",none,,2021-03-08 16:47:54.375442,0

I imagine the implication the film attempts is that Pitt's character may have killed his wife accidentally (i.e. the boat shook and he pulled the trigger on a spear gun as a reflex) or perhaps her ""shrewish behavior"" caused him, in a moment of frustrationc to pull the trigger (which would be awful and definitely murder, but could potentially allow the character to be ""redeemable"" through his later acts. Regardless it is weird the film never has the character address the issue or confirm or disconfirm his guilt. Unlike Grace I don't presume he's guilty just because he accepts his status as a pariah, but I do agree that the fact that ambiguity is present but then goes unresolved is a weird and unsatisfying story choice.

1. I didn't get that impression about the women in the movie but see what you're saying. Women in the movie were depicted EXACTLY like Hollywood treats them though, so I feel it's a commentary on that.


2. I don't think Pitt definitely killed his wife. I believe this was about the current state of things and how people are now assumed guilty before innocent. We don't know what happened, yet you are quick to say he's guilty. He was the most mellow character, and turned down that girl because she was too young. I don't see why you would immediately assume he killed his wife.

They can be that and murderers, too. That’s part of the tragedy of what Manson did to them, he took their innocence and naïveté and used it to make them do whatever he wanted.

Also, the Bruce Lee thing is...complicated. Lee, while being an incredible martial artist and one of the posthumous greats, was also kind of arrogant and would go and pick fights. The fight’s likely a reference to the Bruce Lee and Wong Jack Man fight, which is pretty long to get into here.

At no point does Tarantino imply that Tate was complacent in her own murder or that if ""real men"" were there, they would of survived.  This is a fairy tale/wish fulfillment, just like Inglorious Basterds and Django Unchained.  Did a group of elite Jewish fighters make laughing stocks of the Nazis and kill Hitler?  No.  Did slaves making laughing stocks of their captors, get their freedom, and get violent revenge on their captors?  No.  But, in Tarantino's world they do.  And in OUATIH, the Manson murderers are comically thwarted.  Instead of Tate getting murdered, signalling the end of ""classic"" Hollywood, she survives and in Tarantino's world, perhaps the 60's Hollywood he so loves so much survives as well.  He doesn't hate women.  But, this is a story of fading Hollywood, through the prism of a fading star played by DiCaprio, wrapped around the friendship of two men, Pitt and DiCaprio.   The inference that Pitt killed is wife is just that, background to make him come across as dangerous.  That, and his take down of Bruce Lee, is all there to set up the ending.

Oh, and I'm black, and always found his use of the N-word eye-rolling at best and annoyed at worst. I get the stories he's telling such as Django make that language fitting in a way, but it just feels like someone finding a gratuitous method to apply it.

Too bad you were bothered by so many issues that you couldn't enjoy it.
Regarding that ending though,remember that Tarantino has played with real events before.
In Inglorious Bastards,he killed Hitler,in Django he had a former slave get great audience pleasing revenge on evil slave owners.

It's Tarantino's ode to B movies, Westerns and 60's TV and maybe to Burt Reynolds and Charles Bronson  (RIP.) Totally sentimental and unironic and yes, undoubtedly masculine. 

I can understand why women would be turned off. I agree with you that it is retrograde. Yet I believe it to be defensible. It's a tribute to an idea of Hollywood which has been mythologized before. Men in white hats. Heroes who talk straight, walk straight and hit even truer. 

 But this idea of Hollywood really never was in reality. So Tarantino created a fairy tale for guys and maybe a few women in which the mythology is made flesh.  I think on that premise it works. 

True, the women, especially the girl who comes onto Booth, are objectified. Yet I appreciate the fact that like the men, the women could be on the make as well and be just as lusty and self interested as the men were. ( Armond White makes this point more eloquently in his review of the film.) Probably verboten to say in th era of Metoo but in the era of the Birth Control pill and free love probably perhaps this was more true then.  The scene in the car is an example. 

And as for the child actress? I saw her as an actress who was doing her best to be uber professional on set ( ""I am not an actress!""), yet when she senses that Dalton is not ok she comforts him. I didn't see  anything untoward with that. It seemed to be one actor consoling another on the job during a time of trial. Creating an ensemble. When Rick picks himself up and aces the scene with the girl the payoff is them acting like they are in conflict but not (He apologizes to her for the throw, but she is just as game for improv, pointing at her elbow pad.

 Finally, (Spoiler)  Though I enjoyed the fantastical aspect of the end, I can see how Tarantino really amped up the absurdity of it for laughs. It nearly undercuts the rest of the film for me. I must say I was one of the few audience members in the audience who was laughing during that moment.  Most were silent. Still I enjoyed it.

I strongly disagree with the idea that Tarantino disrespected Sharon Tate and the other victims of the murder at her residence. The film portrays them all in a positive light, as decent people at the precipice of fame yet not afflicted with the trappings of stardom. The ending of the film grants Sharon Tate and the others (including real-life widow Roman Polanski) with the continuous lives they deserved. It's odd that he saves them from their tragic fates, and that is somehow seen as exploitative or disrespectful.

Using something once in film could mean a lot of things, but twice, like with the feet and snoring, it’s obvious Grace is on the right track here. Also, that stuff with Uma Thurman and the stunt Tarantino made her do for Kill Bill 2 and she defended him even though she was coerced into doing it as she eludes to in a few interviews.

It would have been nice for Sharon Tate to be the hero except that she is pregnant. That means: no kung fu for her.

I often don't agree with your reviews, and sometimes, even your commentary, but I appreciate your right to fight for what you believe in and for your right to talk about your beliefs and about film. In this case, I really appreciate your thoughtful, well-explained commentary on this movie and the time period it erroneously depicts. I was a little disgusted about a lot of the concepts of this film, and I was not a fan of the choice of Robbie as Sharon Tate (nor the depiction of who Sharon was). I grew up in the late 60s/early 70s under the spectre of the rise of the serial killer, nuclear fears, the end of the Vietnam War, the rise of feminism, Watergate, the energy crisis, and the Bronx Zoo/Summer of Sam (I mean the Yankees and how NY was in the 70s). I have always been haunted by the Manson family and the gruesome Tate/LaBianca murders and how they changed Hollywood. How Terry Melcher's spurning of Manson's delusional estimation and belief in his own talent (and the little known fact that he also owed a ton of money to the Mob) caused one of the most horrific moments in history. As repulsive as Roman Polanski was (as well as his buddy Don Johnson, who never seemed to suffer the same fate as Polanski), there was never a real sense that he necessarily abused Sharon Tate. By all accounts, he truly adored her and was positively over the moon of her impending baby, and was crushed at her death. At any rate, I bring all this up because I am so disgusted at the constant need to feed Manson's ego (and bolster his insane followers' bloodlust), that Hollywood keeps feeding it with stories of him/them. Why not allow him to be forgotten, like should have happened. Yes, we all depict historical events, and we need to mark the impact that he had on these people and life then, but had everyone treated him as a nobody, he wouldn't have continued to wield the power he had, even from behind bars. Instead, people continue to glorify him. That is exactly what he wanted. Regardless, to think that too skinny, puny men would have taken care of the LSD-fueled, hopped up savages that were the Family, is ridiculous. It is positively preposterous (and Bruce Lee would have kicked their behinds six ways to Sunday).",none,,2021-03-08 16:47:56.159314,0

I have to disagree with some of the statements you made about the portrayl of women in the film. Not all of the women were just seen as objects.I think Sharon Tate was portrayed as a nice young woman who was clearly excited about her career taking off and becoming a mother. The child actress was fierce and serious about her job and was willing to get knitty gritty for the role (elbow pads and all). Leo's new wife defended herself against one of the Manson girls!

I asked 12 people at work and they had never Heard of Mr Roger. Tom Hanks is not a big name at the box office in Europe anymore. Captain Phillips and Sully is people we have never heard of before.

Kurt Russell’s character is known in the film as someone who firmly believes as well as his wife that Cliff Booth did kill his wife on a boat... now we also know that brad Pitt is reimagining a time of when he had a confrontation on set about it back in the day, and imagining what they must be thinking about what he did to his wife and that it will be brought up again... now with these two things that are clearly stated in the film... It can be very obvious that the flashback  scene we saw was a reimagined look at what happened through the eyes of someone who thinks cliff booth killed his wife, and that being viewed through the eyes of cliff booth as the reason why he wouldn’t want to go to the movie set. This could very well mean that the entire flash back we see is pure fiction, and to be honest I believe that was what Tarantino  was going for and people didn’t catch on or misinterpreted the information being given on screen.

I disagree with a lot of your takes. I enjoyed the movie quite a bit and plan to give it a second watch to see if any of your points take me in a different direction. I really enjoyed Rick and Cliff’s relationship and the story of their career arc. Areas that I disagree on. The whole foot thing is just QT and his known foot obsession. The little girl actress really seemed to me like an honest moment where she was being sincere in her reaction and commentary but not at all sexual. And for the ending..I did not see it at all as a slight to Sharon Tate or the others who were murdered. Much like Inglorious Basterds, the ending felt like an exercise in catharsis for the audience. It’s not QTs fault if viewers are unaware of the Manson murders as most are very aware going into the movie and I think most will appreciate that the 3 members of the family received what they did. The final aerial shot of Rick being greeted by Sharon and the other 3 was beautiful to me. Rick got what he was hoping for with a foot in the door with his new-Hollywood neighbors and it was a way for QT to shine a light on the lives of Sharon and the others and how inviting and loving they were in contrast to the Manson family.

The meticulous recreation of 1969 Hollywood and the brilliant sweeping shots Tarantino uses to romanticize it is endlessly fascinating. Tarantino finally examines the melancholy side of nostalgia and the result is heartwarming and powerful. It is not a movie for everyone. It’s a slow burn that’s deliberately paced but teases the inevitable shocking ending every step of the way. I loved it. A masterclass of direction. I do think it lacks Tarantino’s signature dialogue though. I needed my Jules/Vincent “Royale with Cheese”, “Foot massage”, “Walk the earth” scenes between Pitt/DiCaprio that showed their bromance on fully display. The movie also needed more DaKota Fanning (who is remarkable in her one scene), Margot Robbie (the heart and soul of the movie), and Margaret Qualley (explosively temptous and creepy at the same time).

So I think Tarantino portrayed women like that because they used to be portrayed like that, not necessarily because they actually were like that. It's like the style of those days. That would also explain why Pitt's character is still famous and nobody seems to have a problem with him killing his wife. And unfortunately, those things still happen today. Polanski is happy abroad, even Woody Allen is happy making movies after marrying his daughter... Things might have changed, but not that much and especially not in Hollywood. As for the bizarre ending with the Manson family, I guess it's just because it's supposed to be a made-up ending, how things would've ended following the 1960s movie vibe. Again, I haven't seen the movie yet, but I believe it could just be due to the fact that it's a movie based on the regular 60s aesthetics.",none,,2021-03-08 16:47:57.837367,0

I felt the exact same way leaving the theater last night - because I thoroughly enjoyed this movie...and it feels wrong. Aesthetically, this movie is perfect, and it sucks you into the glitz and glamour of 1960s Hollywood. And that I think is Tarantino's point: he's saying that Hollywood should've stayed that way. It's his revenge fairytale, hence the movie's title. He's giving us the ending we're all led to believe in popular Hollywood media: that everything is happy, the bad guys died, and DiCaprio and Robbie can have a lovely meeting once the fighting's done. I have the same fear that uninformed moviegoers will believe the story as true. I put in my review on Facebook that people should do research and have general knowledge before seeing this movie. It's easy to think that after the Manson Family murdered Sharon Tate, Hollywood was shocked to its core and then responded over time with darker and edgier films. The glamour and the fantasy disappeared. Of course, that presents the main problem, because Tarantino is so hell-bent on changing history to fit HIS vision of what he thinks Hollywood should've stayed like. And you're right: he's not critiquing or even playing with the trope of the ""strong male hero"" coming in to save the day...he just presents it. Though I can't speak of or for the female perspective, I thought Sharon Tate's scene enjoying herself in the movie theater was a reflection of how movie stars look for more than just validation from critics - she's experiencing her movie with a general audience and happy that they're positively responding to her comedy. Again, I can't speak of that scene from a female perspective and what it was like for you to watch it, but that's what I thought he was getting at - it seemed more than just objectification. Overall, I really liked this movie...but something feels wrong in saying that. I like the conversations this movie is starting, which in turn makes me like it more...but it feels weird to enjoy someone blatantly changing history, especially when it was such a tragic and intimately shocking story.",none,,2021-03-08 16:47:58.364342,0

I can’t tell if it is genuinely cynical audience indoctrination and normalization, was supposed to be a commentary on it (realllly doubt that one,) or if it just happened organically in production as everyone involved in the production literally indoctrinated themselves. 

It winds up smothering the audience in the uneasy vibes of a film made entirely by people who refused to take the red pill. 

Groupthink during the creative process is a very real thing, and it almost seems like this movie was made by people so far down the rabbit hole together they never took a step back and said “Wait, hold on. What is the point of this project? I forgot.”

","The last 5 minutes of the movie explain everything. 2 things:1- The photo of his daughter and Jimmy. These 2 persons are these ones that he loves the most. It reminds him how he lost them both. Frank killed his best friend and he lost his daughter after she understood he did it.2- The door half open at 1 minute before the end. Jimmy used to let the door of his bedroom open because he trusted Frank. Frank broke the trust and as a result he could never talk to his daughter again. This door represent the trust, and show that trust must never be broken. Trust is even more important than love because without trust there can be no real love.Great movie, great actors, congratulations Mr Scorsese."
1," It's brilliant, but best to go in with as few expectations as possible
","When I love a movie as much as I loved The Irishman, I feel torn. On one hand, I want to review it and rave about it and try to convince others to see it. But then on the other hand, I realise that doing so could set expectations too high, which could then lead to some people getting disappointed (this happens a lot with horror movies that get hyped at film festivals and then rejected by disappointed wide audiences, like with The Witch, It Follows, and Hereditary).So that leaves me in a tricky situation, and I'll compromise by praising the film as much as I can without overhyping, whilst also making vague comments that won't be specific enough to ruin what the film has to offer (because yes: it's a Scorsese film. He has an incredibly varied filmography when you break down just what he's made over the last half-century, and so you're never going to get exactly what you'd expect).Okay, acting: phenomenal. Besides Goodfellas, Pesci's best performance ever. This is the best De Niro's been since Cape Fear. This is the best Al Pacino has been in at least three decades. These men are old, and all accomplished and wealthy enough to retire happily at this point, but thankfully they all agreed to not only star in this movie, but commit themselves 100%. No one's phoning it in here. While the supporting cast are uniformly solid, these three steal the show and I hope all get Oscar nominations come awards season.Scorsese, to no one's surprise, directs brilliantly throughout, making every scene purposeful and captivating. The movie is long, but deservedly so. The various pay-offs towards the film's conclusion would not hit nearly as hard if the film didn't spend so long building character, suspense, and emotion.As crude as it might sound, this movie- at about the halfway point- made me forget how badly I needed to use the theatre's restroom. At a certain point, I accepted that I couldn't miss a second, and leaving the room for even a moment was totally out of the question.If you can see this at a cinema, and can handle three and a half hours without a toilet or snack break (no intermission!), then by all means, watch it on a big screen, because it's beautiful and ultimately the best way to experience a film of this scope and spectacle. But it'll be on Netflix soon, and perhaps some would prefer to watch it in the comfort of their own home, where snack/toilet breaks are possible.Whatever you do, make sure you ultimately watch it. Films like this don't come around too often, and this is such a perfect swan-song for this talented group that I doubt we'll see these legends together again.It's bittersweet, but if this is Scorsese's, De Niro's, Pacino's and Pesci's farewell to the crime genre, then it's an amazing note to go out on."
2," The Last Of Its Kind
","I don't know where to start on this one other than thanking Netflix for being the only distributor to fund this movie so we could see Big screen legends take their last big swing. The set and screen is smaller than I liked it to be, it being released on a streaming site but it's better than never seeing it.It's not a flawless movie and I wouldn't necessarily call it a masterpiece or something new and innovative. But for an old genre gangsta flick it's easily one of the best ones out there.The plot is a lot like Godfather 2 from De Niros perspective but that's all there is. It is more grounded and far too subtle compared to Goodfellas. And that's a good thing considering the age of the lead actors in the movie. But that doesn't mean its dull, gray and dreary because it isn't. It is surprisingly humorous, has some very serious scenes and doesn't shy away from giving us a blast of nostalgia every now and then.The cinematography is quite different from the usual modern movies we are accustomed to. It doesn't have an overabundance of Wes Anderson symmetric shots or Roger Deakins like Wide angle shots. The film was shot in a very old timey way with the camera pans and edits. The editing in the movie is great and the score is fitting. Technical aspects considered it isn't innovative or something jawdropping, but that was never supposed to be the main focus of the movie.The main focus for me was absolutely the acting. And why wouldn't it be with a cast like this? Al Pacino and Robert De Niro for the 1st time on screen together since Heat. Joe Pesci and De Niro since Goodfellas. Joe Pesci coming out of retirement and Martin Scorsese directing all these legends on screen together! If this doesn't get you excited for this film then I'm afraid nothing will.Speaking of acting my god do they act! Robert De Niro gives his best performance in his older age with this. Joaquin Phoenix was a top contender for best Actor Oscar and I agreed with that but after watching THE IRISHMAN everything changed. Robert De Niro basically steals his Oscar like a gangsta and gives the best performance of the year so far. Old Bobby here still giving top notch actors a run for their money and the guy is 76 years old!When was the last time you saw Al Pacino give a really good performance? Well that's exactly what he does here and it feels so good to see him find his glory days. He is his usual shouty self but shines better when he tones it down and let expressions speak.And boy have I missed Joe Pesci over the years and don't worry he's still intense as usual. And that's weird considering he is extremely toned down in this movie. If you're looking for a violent Joe Pesci like he was in Goodfellas you'll be disappointed. But if you're looking for an intimidating Pesci with a huge presence then you're in the right place.Harvey Keitel is in the movie for a very short time but he did his job fantastically. Ray Romano was a surprising standout and I can't believe how he kept up on the same plane as some of these industry legends. He doesn't really have a bigger role and basically gets lost as the film progresses but he made the most of his screentime.The film is 3hours and 30 minutes long but it never felt that long honestly. The first 2 hours went by a breeze but the 3rd hour was unapologetically slow. It felt a bit dragged on during the final hour and felt it was skipping ahead at the same time. it wasn't boring in any way but felt it could've been handled better. The CGI de-aging is so good that after a while you get confused how old the lead actors actually are. This is the best de-aging tech I've ever seen honestly.Despite it being slow in the latter end it still is a fantastic film. It doesn't set out to do something different, it doesn't try to set it aside from the herd. Scorsese did what he does best and made the movie he wanted to make. Its more of a last big hurrah for these living legends than something out to be a flawless masterpiece. It will most likely be the last of its kind and also the last collaboration of Scorsese with these acting legends. Considering the time we are in this might as well be the last Scorsese film, it most definitely is the last Joe Pesci appearance in a movie and the last good mobster hit with genre legends like Al Pacino and De Niro. So enjoy it while you can and savor it. Remember this movie 10 years from now and rejoice that you were alive to witness something truly fantastic. THE IRISHMAN is a farewell for most of these legends and a loveletter to the genre. It's the last of its kind and it went out in true mobster style."
3," The Scorsese format still works decades later.
","I was able to attend the NYC premiere this afternoon. Now that I've gotten over the shock of seeing so many celebrities, I'm able to happily to say that this movie, while being quite long, deserves to be remembered as one of Scorsese's great films.The Irishman reminds me a bit of Tarantino's recent hit Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood, both because it's a period piece and also because you need to know a little history to understand the direction of the narrative. The movie, while following Frank Sheeran (Robert De Niro) as the titular character, revolves around Teamsters union boss James Riddle Hoffa (played with intense and hilarious fervor by Al Pacino). Fortunately Frank goes to great lengths to narrate the story for the audience and provides a healthy dose of context for those of us not from the Kennedy era. The main thing you need to know going in is that Jimmy Hoffa had mob ties, and that he vanished in 1975 and was presumed murdered by mob bosses for being ""uncooperative"".The movie unfolds over four acts, told over several decades by Frank Sheeran. In act one, Frank is introduced as a WWII veteran who is stuck driving food delivery trucks in and around Philadelphia. He has the bright idea to steal some of the steaks that he's delivering, and sell them to local mobster Felix ""Skinny Razor"" DiTullio (Bobby Cannavale). Eventually his brazen willingness to break the law catches the eye of Italian mob boss Russell Bufalino (Joe Pesci), who happens to be a mobster on a national level. His calm demeanor is both comical yet terrifying. A soon to be classic line encompasses Bufalino perfectly: ""You might be demonstrating a failure to show appreciation."" Under his mentorship, Frank becomes a ruthless action man for the italian mob and explains with rather entertaining dispassion how he does his job properly. In act two, Russell introduces Frank to Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino), the outspoken and fearless president of the National Teamsters Union. Their relationship grows and Hoffa becomes Frank's second mentor. Together they use intimidation and bribery to gain influence until the election of John Kennedy, who subsequently appoints his brother Bobby Kennedy as Attorney General and immediately goes after Hoffa.The first two and a half hours are the most fun, and in particular the end of act three is some of the most tense and dramatic storytelling that I have had the pleasure of seeing in recent memory. At a dinner celebration for Frank (who eventually becomes a Teamster boss himself), tensions between Hoffa, Bufalino and the other mobsters reaches a breaking point, and the decision is made to make Hoffa disappear. But in a gut wrenching twist, Frank is the one tasked to do the job. In a beautiful display of cinematography over a thirty-minute buildup, Scorsese forces the viewer to the edge of their seats with the dread of what's about to happen. Robert De Niro's performance in these moments is master class; the inner conflict is all the more apparent thanks all of the time we spent watching Frank being raised by Bufalino and Hoffa in equal measure. I plan to watch this part of the film again, probably with a notepad.Getting away from the plot a bit, the movie is actually surprisingly funny. In one particular scene, someone insults an older Bufalino at a dinner reception. He and Frank exchange glances, and the frame suddenly cuts to a hotel bed covered in guns. Frank then narrates with excess detail and hilarious dispassion the ideal weapon for a public assassination. Moments like these are littered throughout the film and keep it from getting too bogged down in it's violence. It's impressive how quickly jokes fly, given the disproportionate amount of people getting shot point blank in the head. But anyone who has seen Scorsese's Goodfellas or The Departed will feel right at home.The heart of the movie is definitely Robert De Niro, Al Pacino and Joe Pesci. De Niro was de-aged with apparently exorbitantly priced CGI, as he is supposed to be younger than both Pacino and Pesci. While it's fairly obvious, I was never too distracted to not enjoy what was unfolding onscreen. Plus he's kind of made a career of holding one scowling facial expression, so that probably was a little easier to edit. Al Pacino is a riot as Hoffa, and is certainly one of the most arrogant, over-the-top characters that Pacino has played in awhile. Pesci as Bufalino is chilling, and it's fun to seem him as the boss in this gangster movie after being a junior-level mobster in Goodfellas so many years ago. The mentorship between De Niro's character and both Pacino and Pesci is amazingly entertaining.The only thing keeping me from calling this movie perfect is it's length. Three hours and (almost) thirty minutes is a very long time, and while occurring infrequently the movie does drag a bit. This is most apparent in the fourth act where Frank introspects during his final years, and attempts to achieve reconciliation for all the murders he's committed. It doesn't really offer any closure or seem necessary to wrapping up the narrative.Ultimately that doesn't even come close to making me not recommend seeing The Irishman. There's a reason Martin Scorsese will forever be known for his gangster movies. Combining comedy, violence, brotherhood and drama, he has created a formula that continues to work. The fact that he continues to make excellent movies at 76 years old blows my mind. Well done."
4," Latest entry in the Emperor's New Clothes Club
","You have to be absolutely out of your mind to legitimately think that this is Scorcese at his best and ignore all the flaws in this movie. Yes, I get it, he made a lot of great movies in his time, but this isn't one of them.A scene early on with Deniro beating someone up sums up the movie pretty well. The random no-name actor getting beat up is the only one exhibiting any emotion, as Deniro's character and his daughter sleepwalk their way through the scene like most of the cast does through most other scenes. It can be a bit hard to tell though since the camera zooms out so far that you can hardly see their faces, probably in an effort to avoid using the piss poor de-aging effects during an ""action"" scene, but it doesn't much matter because it's still close enough that we can see Deniro noticeably physically struggling to get through the scene. It looks awful and its depressing to see Deniro like this and to realize that Scorcese thought this scene was ok like this (why would they not have just used a stand-in here?), and this is pretty much how the movie feels in general.This is a very noticeably weak effort from Scorcese. Most of the characters are wooden and just seem bored to be there. Pesci and Deniro are shockingly lifeless here. Pacino seems to be the only one giving any effort, but even his performance only comes off like a pale imitation of his old self.Again, the de-aging effects are very weak and it's pretty jarring to see the flashback version of Deniro's character be referred to as if he's a young man (Pesci even calls him KID), but still looks like he's about 50.There are a ton of side characters introduced, most of which disappear immediately after their introductions and serve no real purpose. Likewise there are many vestigial scenes that serve no purpose to advance either plot or character.The plot is of course your typical gangster fare that we've seen from Scorcese so many times already. Guy gets into a life of crime, rises in the ranks, gets rich and lives it up, and then everything comes crashing down because he and everyone else he knows are absolutely terrible people, blah blah blah, we've seen it all before, but you know, you take something more recent of his like The Wolf of Wall Street and even though it uses that same old formula it still manages to be interesting because the characters have such personality and style and they keep your eyes glued to the conflict even though you already know exactly where it's going.Here? Not so much. The Irishman is an absolutely unremarkable mobster story with completely forgettable characters that don't seem at all interested in their roles and some production values and cinematography that the so-called king of cinema should be embarrassed to be associated with, and let me tell you, you people defending this weak excuse for a film aren't doing Scorcese or ""cinema"" any favors by blindly swallowing this crap and acting like it's the greatest thing you've ever seen. If you're so willing to suck down any product, no matter how bad, just because it has a big time famous name attached to it than you're really no better than the popcorn action movies and fans that you're so quick to condemn.As someone who's seen every Scorcese film before this, this is a 5/10 AT BEST and I will never pretend otherwise just because he did a lot of great films in the past."
5," I love Scorsese and all the great mobster flicks, but this one is OVERRATED...
","I love all the films of this genre-- Casino, Once Upon a Time in America, Goodfellas, Godfather, Mean Streets, Scarface, The Departed, Carlito's Way, Taxi Driver, etc. Scorsese makes some awesome epics, and I like a wide variety of other directors and their films in this vein. However, I find the hype and the hooplah around this one to fall a bit flat. I am sure I will receive some hate for this opinion, but this movie is nowhere near the level of Goodfellas or Scarface.1) The Run Time= I am fine with a 3.5 hour movie, but it needs to be great enough to fill that amount of time. I mean, at least 60-75% of it should be amazing. This movie is WAY TOO LONG for no reason. I can think of about 5 scenes that could be cut or condensed that did nothing to further the plot.2) The Aging and De-Aging of Actors= This was actually very distracting from the movie, and made me laugh in several scenes. Was this really NECESSARY? It seemed cheap and corny, and it really takes away from the movie instead of helping it. Wouldn't it be better to just get younger actors to play the really young scenes of DeNiro, Pesci, Pacino, etc??? No one is buying the age of these guys, even with CGI technology and effects. It ruined the belief of the moment.3) Pesci looked 139 years old throughout the movie, even in scenes where he is supposed to be young.4) Harvey Keitel's talent and presence was greatly wasted, as I barely remember anything that he did or said.5) The Women= the ladies are mentioned at the start of the film by name, and then become completely irrelevant to anything that goes on for 3 hours. They were extremely underdeveloped. This was one thing that complimented Goodfellas well- Ray Liotta's wife was always in the mix, or screwing something up, or threatening to kill him, etc.6) Lack of Suspense or Action= This movie became very run-of-the-mill boring after an hour or so. Nothing surprised me, nothing was exciting, and the action is so neutered and far between that I forgot I was watching a gangster flick. I can still remember Pesci stabbing a guy in the throat with a pen in Casino, or Scarface's last stand, or the beatings given out in Goodfellas. This movie barely had ANY MEMORABLE SCENES that stand out. The only great ones were a couple of really quick and realistic shootings of guys on the street or in an eatery by DeNiro.7) Pacino as Hoffa= He doesn't even resemble Hoffa at all, and neither do other people portraying certain characters. Robert Kennedy comes to mind as well.This is a decent movie, with great production values, classic actors, a legendary director, and nostalgic music with a great soundtrack. However, I just think a 8 or 9 rating is BS for this project. EVERYONE IS SIMPLY SAYING WHAT THEY ARE TOLD TO SAY, just like every other overhyped movie or author or artist. It is a good movie, but far from a masterpiece, or Scorsese's crowning achievement, despite what everyone says.Scarface, Goodfellas, Godfather, Departed= all light years beyond this movie, and with a shorter run time. This film needed to be tightened up and given some better scenes. It is interesting, but overbloated and overhyped due to the cast and director-- which can do no wrong in the minds of the average critic or average joe."
6," Good but also boring
","Great acting, very good cinematography and we all know that Scorsese is a amazing director, but the movie is very long, and feels very long, a lot of great movies are very long and they are great, like Lawrence of Arabia and Schindler's List for example, they are classics and in my opinion The Irishman is not going to enter in this category.Also the de-aging CGI is not convincing, and why putting those contact lens in De Niro eyes, when Scorsese made The Aviator he didn't put contact lens on Dicaprio, in Casino, De Niro didn't look anything like the character he was playing, it was unnecessary, probably Netflix fault.The most positive point of the film was Joe Pesci performance, he is very contained but can also show that he is a very dangerous person, very different than the roles he played in others Scorsese's films, which are also great, and some other movies he starred during his career.Looks like we never going to have a great movie with De Niro and Pacino playing two real old guys with a lot of screen time together, and i'm not saying that a lot of screen time together is necessarily better, for example in Righteous Kill they also have a lot screen time, but that movie was bad, in Heat they have only one scene together, two if you counting their confront in the end, but that famous scene in Heat was extremely well written, acted and with perfect timing, but this is for another review."
7," Weak by any standard but by Scorsese it's very
","Sadly a sub-par effort from one of my all time favorite directors. The story is weak (by Scorsese standard) and overly stretched. I can understand the appeal to revisit his trademark Italian gangster genre one more time, but this one feels unnecessary. The also trademark Scorsese humor is in-existent (except for the painting walls bit). De Niro looks disoriented, in the worst physical (hunched over almost the whole movie) and acting shape ever and out of place. Not very surprising, either. He spent the better part of the last 15 to 20 years doing mock impressions of himself which after the novelty faded ended him up in a series of quite dubious productions. That's a very long time to lower the bar and obviously takes its toll.The De-aging technique is unconvincing when the actors move. Their faces look animated, fake. There is little and uninspired music. Keitel looks fantastic but is underused. Pacino kinda overacts on occasion. Pesci looks fantastic and is in top form acting-wise but he's also in a supporting role (he's the best part of the movie) so he doesn't have a big impact on the movie. Romano is in top form but his part is also small.The movie is slow, linear, extremely long, predictable (how often have we seen the Hoffa story on screen? a superior version starring Nicholson comes to mind) and dull. There isn't much going on action-wise. A lot of innuendo and he said they said, but aside some quite dull hit-jobs where de Niro is supposed to be in his prime but moves like a 75 year old the story is quite static. The dialog is stale. Stunts are weak to say the least (Pacino's double excessively hiding his face when he hits the floor in a fight and obviously wearing a wig and body padding, and the store owner more than obviously throwing himself through the window of the store while De Niro clumsily mimics hitting him around come to mind, rendering those scenes borderline laughable). Colors, interiors, costumes are all in shades of beige. Camera work is rigid. Plus the Hoffa story is old news to begin with, there are so many insane things going on right now and would translate better to the screen in 2019. The edgy fast paced crazy energy of the more recent Wolf of Wall Street (not to mention his earlier masterpieces Casino, Raging Bull, Taxi Driver, Mean Streets or Goodfellas etc) seems that of a different director.All in all the weakest film in Scorsese's portfolio and not above a 6 stars out of 10 by any standard (I'm inclined to be lenient mainly because he managed to bring Pesci out of retirement for this. But by Scorsese standard it's well below that). It's more of a self-indulgent piece of nostalgia best left unmentioned when it's all said and done. And I'm hopeful that Marty will surprise us with more of his best work in the future and we can sweep this one under the rug."
8," Grossly Overhyped
","If your one of those people thinking about getting Netflix just so you can see this dinosaur, please don't.
Watching Robert DeNero in this film is almost sad. He plays the part of a guy in his prime, but the CGI face doesn't work. It looks animated at times and his body moves like a very old man ... even for DeNero's age of mid 70's.
The grocery sceen where DeNero beats up the store owner is just embarrassing to watch.
Joe Pesci comes out of retirement for this one and shines. He has a stare that burns a hole through you.
Al Pacino as the flamboyant Jimmy Hoffa works well.
Harvey's Keitel in a small mob boss roll is solid too.
But the editing is not together ... the movis drags ... and the fellas in the film unfortunately are just too old to pull this off convincingly.
It's too bad this wasn't made 25 years ago, it would have probably worked.
Grossly overhyped epic that is passed its prime, in more than one way.
Would never waste 3.5 hrs watching again.
If your hoping for the next Goodfellas, you've come to the wrong place."
9," Sorry Scorcese, TLDR.
","Some might hate it but here is a little bit of truth about the Irishman, against the 8s and the 9s and the 10s:
It is a ""Too long didn't read"" kind of movie.
What is the reason of this enormous more-than-three-hours runtime? Probably to enjoy as much as possible Pesci, Pacino and De Niro working together.
But folks, this time has come and gone...
Goodfellas, Casino etc. and anything Scorcese did is amazing.
But getting mob-type genre back in play in 2020 needs a bit of a twist and taste for the different audiences. 3' 24"" is outrageously long and slow even for the fanatics.
I watched it on Netflix and it took 2 days to go through the movie.
Very slow character development, which is absolutely not necessary, as we as audiences are already trained in this genre.
If you don't like this mob-type genre and these actors, there is almost no chance you would watch this movie or you 'd drop it after half an hour.
Only plus is the good acting of course and the great directing but...if you are new to this genre, start from the classics!

10," Oh god De Niro's phone call oh god!
","""What kind of a man makes a phone call like that!""
It Happened!
I've watched it!
Quite simply, The Best Film of the Year!
No, of the Last 3 Years!
The hype is real, set your expectations as high as you can possibly reach!Let me tell you something, I'm 25 years old and I didn't really got the chance to live the era of Masterpieces, I didn't see Raging Bull/Goodfellas/Dog Day Afternoon at its time, I didn't experience how its like to watch the best actors of all time in their fully artistic command.
The first time I've watched Raging Bull I truly envied those people who lived in the 80s, I was always wishing if time can just go back and see De Niro's rage or hear Pacino's Attica once in a theater! But guess what, It happened!This is the end of the era! The summation of Scorsese/De Niro/Pesci/ Pacino career, a final statement by masters!
Robert De Niro is EXPLOSIVE!
Pacino/Pesci are unexpectedly MARVELOUS!
Zaillian's screenplay is on point, you can't go wrong with him.
A 3.5 hour film without a single dragging minute, a poem of friendship, betrayal, regret and time!"
11," DeNiro beating up diner guy is where it goes bad
","The movie stars bold, we get some nice action, a somewhat of a storytelling and trying to ignore weird looking CGI on DeNiro's face.But what happens later, oh man.....When i saw this 76 year old men ""beating up"" the guy in diner for touching his daughter, with moves like grandpa, clumsy and unnatural i left my pink glasses and really started to pay attention to details.Aside from Pacino's acting, and best CGI looking effect as far as i'm concerned, the movie after 1,5 hrs becomes dull and stretched.Would have been much much much better to have had youngsters for half of the movie so it doesn't ruin the experience afterwards as we're looking to the same faces that's supposed to tell a story of a 30 years timeline and so.And i could have lived with that if it wasn't the bad screenplay....I was so anxious to see a movie with all my favorite actors and got to the conclusion that in life it's better to go down in grace than disgraced."
12," Disappointing by Scorsese standards
","First off, let me set this straight that I'm not repeled by long or slow films. However, The Irishman is at the very least 30-40 minutes too long, and the suspense sometimes is killed off by characters dragging the scene too much. The biggest offender would be the second last arc which I'm not gonna spoil.Secondly, for such a slow film you'd expect the pay off to be worth it, but it isn't. The message of the film is revealed very early on, and it's very obvious where this particular plot line is going to. These 2 factors (slow pace and obvious plotline) make the film feels particularly unrewarding to me.Third is the lack of the 'wow' factor, which is disappointing for such a godlike cast and crew. There is not a single memorable scene or line that stands out for me, despite the actors all doing a phenomenal job. And no, I don't really mind the CGI, even though it's not the best thing since sliced bread. The music is not memorable either, even though it can be an artistic choice to make the film feels more grounded and unglamorous.So where does this leave us? Personally I don't think this is a bad film, but it feels disappointing with such a big roster. Don't expect this to be the film to watch with friends over, as it's pretty (unneccessarily) lengthy and the undertone is meant to be a heavy one."
13," No wide cinema release? I understand why.
","Watching the wax museum version of De Niro for more than three hours wasn't the blast I hoped for. The CGI is not there yet. Dead eyes. Very distracting.Al Pacino pretty much tries to play Al Pacino, De Niro his usual bitter self, but nice to see wax-Pesci, who was the most believable character. He completely outshines wax-De Niro here.Oh, and by the way, Scorsese: there were no twin towers in the late 60's.I can rewatch 'Goodfellas' and 'Casino' over and over again. I will not be returning to 'The Irishman'"
14," Gangster Avengers born for Netflix
","This film is super long. Too long to sit in the cinema for as fantastic as it looks. I ran out of snacks, I was so gripped I didn't go to the toilet which meant my bladder was bursting only adding to the tension.This is pretty much the Avengers of the gangster movies where all of your favourite people are in one film written by the best writer and directed by the best director. Only Walken and Woods are missing.Making de niro young kind of works and isn't as distracting as I thought and Pacino is fantastic. If you expect Pesci to be the nutjob he was in the other Scorsese movies then think again and this is no bad thing. Pesci is one of the best actors alive with a fantastic range and this movie proves it.The Irishman is lovely to look at but for god sakes take a leak before you go or wait for its Netflix debut where you can watch it with whiskey and pause it for comfort breaks."
15," What a mess of a movie
","I cannot fathom two things: how this movie cost so much to produce, and why they wasted so much money doing so. This movie like watching a documentary about a political campaign that never ends. Seriously, save yourself 3 hours of the most boring and monotonous mash up ever. There is virtually no action or incentive to keep watching. It's 90% people talking at tables with lines like ""Who said that?! oh he said that?!"" or ""Ok, well you talk to him Frank!"" and then Frank talks to him, and then Frank talks to the other guys, and then Frank talks to him, and rinse and repeat. Occasionally a few seconds are spared for shooting someone in the head and then that's it. You are constantly left searching for a reason to keep watching, but it never comes.The acting is not even that good either. With the exception of De Niro and Joe Pesci, it seemed a little awkward. Al Pacino walks, talks and acts funny. They may have de-aged faces but the postures are very out of sync with their ages for almost all the actors. There was a scene where De Niro beats up a grocery guy that looked more like a rehearsal rather than an actual scene. I'm shocked they let it pass. I only laughed at one scene that had to do with ears and that's it (which is why I give this 2 stars instead of 1).I also gotta say that the ending was so anti-climactic and long-winded that after the movie I seriously sat there for a moment and contemplated why I wasted all this time on this hyped up monstrosity. Everyone claiming this is a masterpiece is either paid to say so or are saying so because of all the fancy names attached to this title. Or maybe they think they're being hip acting like this was worth a damn, I don't know. What I do know is that this is a complete disaster of a film and a waste of your valuable time."
16," Review the Movie, not the Director
","Peoples are losing their minds over the sainted director, forgetting the movie. Sure, it's well made, fascinating history. But it's second nature for De Niro, and Pacino overreaches at times. The third reel is repetitive over the decline of the De Niro character. Would be a better movie at 2hr 30. In fact, I thought it had ended about then, but it meandered on another hour."
17," Just amazing
","Classic Scorsese . De Niro is the best he's been for years . Pacino is really magnetic and charming . But for me, Joe Pesci is the standout. Quietly deadly, magnetic , loyal, complicated, its him that will get the Oscar . Saw it at the cinema ( sorry Netflix but I am not watching Scorsese at home ) and it was superb.
Oh Anna Paquin is used quite cleverly as well. Good actress . Decent performance
Go and see it at the cinema . You will remember the masters returning for one last ride"
18," 3 and half hours that would been better used....
","I love Scorsese's films, but this was one, is just one too many. It lacked tight editing, scenes lingered far too long to make artistic points. The technology of that allowed the actors to be made younger was not impressive given the actors could not move as if they were younger. The one scene that made this point, was when De Niro's character roughs up a corner grocer for shoving his daughter. The scene is difficult to watch given De Niro seemed to struggle as much with his own lack of mobility to carry off the fight scene realistically despite having the willing and compliant younger actor. Al Pacino's character looked nothing like Hoffa. Yes the acting was good in general, but the story was just too drawn out and slow and the characters were just not that interesting to hold your attention. As a man of 58, the hardest fact is recognizing the increasing limitation as we age, this movie opens with De Niro's character in an assisted care facility. It is where this movie should have stayed. The Actors and Directors are all legends, but this movie only took away from some of their carrier luster."
19," Meh
","Few years took for this film to arrive, Don't Believe tha Hype, this ain't no classic. Slow burn, with the last part sending me to sleep. Actors old made to look young and young-ish actor made to look old, De Niros dodgy contact lenses, also the way he beats up the greengrocer that was comical, looked like a 90 year old man dishing out a lame beating, notice his foot stamp with the opposite foot an nothing being under it hahahaa, Stephen Graham's accent dodgy. Years for this pffftttt."
20," Long, dull, uneventful
","Remember Bugsy Malone? That gangster film where all the characters were kids?Well, The Irishman is a gangster film where all the characters are geriatrics. At the start of the film, De Niro's CGI youthened character still looked like he's 50. They all do. They're old, fat, hunched, liver-spotted killers, even when they're supposedly young(er). It's weird.The film just drags on and on and never really gets going. The plot is disjointed and never really tells a story or builds a narrative. Unlike Scorsese's classics like Casino or Goodfellas, this film really struggles to develop a story worth watching.3.5 hours. $160M budget. Good Lord. At least this rubbish will be 'free' on Netflix soon. There's a reason no one else wanted it - it wasn't going to make any money at the cinema. Even the $13 you pay for Netflix is too much for this film."
21," Badda Bing! ... Badda BUST!
","Is it just me, or is Robert DeNiro once again portraying the mindless and aging FBI honcho Robert Mueller from SNL fame in this lengthy biographical film????? He sure runs like a 76 year old man so why no stunt double for DeNiro?Pacino isn't playing Jimmy Hoffa. Every time he opens his loud mouth, Al Pacino is just playing himself. In fact a VERY OLD looking 79 year old over-the-hill version of Al Pacino. Sad. Terribly sad. Jimmy Hoffa is rolling over in his grave or he is breaking through 20 tons of concrete to stop a has been like Pacino ruin his reputation.Mrs. Shullivan and I were anticipating another long awaited Martin Scorsese 1960's-1970's period masterpiece crime film, but instead what we disappointedly sat through was an over-hyped, (too) lengthy quasi biography on just one of the many here say storylines on the 1975 sudden and mysterious disappearance of former union Teamster President Jimmy Hoffa.This film version of the missing Jimmy Hoffa focuses on three main characters, Hoffa played by Al Pacino, mob boss Russell Bufalino played by Joe Pesci, and the underling stuck in the middle of Hoffa and Bufalino, teamster labour leader Frank Sheeran, played by Robert DeNiro.THE GOOD:
Make no mistake, without actor Joe Pesci's strong but silent type mobster boss performance this film would have been most likely rated nothing more than a Grade B film with more than half of the finished product still sitting on the cutting room floor. Unlike the previous Scorsese directed mob films where Joe Pesci plays a raging out of control mobster maniac, in this biographical film Pesci plays a silent, very controlled, smart and resourceful mobster fixer who doesn't say much, but when he does, you better listen. I felt Pesci's strong performance and especially his one-on-one interactions with his underling Frank Sheeran kept the flame from going out on this otherwise forgettable and over rated film. Pesci played a similar role (crime boss) in the 1993 film, one of my all time favorite crime films, ""A Bronx Tale"", which also co-starred Robert DeNiro and Chazz Palminteri.THE BAD:
Why did Scorsese have the now 76 year old DeNiro and the now 79 year old Pacino play their respective characters Frank Sheeran (DeNiro) and Jimmy Hoffa (Pacino) from their early days in the 1960's through to the year Sheeran actually died of cancer in 2003? The film would have transitioned much better through the five (5) decades of this biographical story line if two different actors had played a younger version of Frank Sheeran and Jimmy Hoffa. Off the top of my head I could see Milo Ventimiglia playing the younger Frank Sheeran and Michael Chiklis playing the younger Jimmy Hoffa during the 1960's scenes and then transitioning to the (past their freshness date) Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino playing the much older versions of their characters.THE UGLY:
The film it's way too loooooong and boring. I understand that NetFlix has to fill in 24 hours per day for their millions of subscribers but to just fill in with extended and continuous chatty scenes that were just wasted minutes as were the smoke breaks alongside the highways and motels, ENOUGH ALREADY!Sadly, I rate it a dismal 2 out of 10. Badda Bing! Badda BUST!"
22," A marmite film
","Clearly you either think this film is a masterpiece, or an overlong slow-moving indulgence. I am afraid I am in the second camp. Having rewatched the Godfather recently, perhaps my expectations were too high. No way is it in the same league."
23," The emperor has no clothes.
","The CGI faces create a soulless effect. It never feels like a real film, just a digital recreation where computerized characters are pretending to be DeNiro, Pacino and Pesci. They basically robbed us of the reunion by experimenting with a technique that fails so badly we know never to do that. The tragedy is this was not a time to experiment. They hang the entire picture on the believability of the de-aging, and it doesn't work for a second. It's egregious, bizarre, and will age horribly for the simple reason it's not registering as acting because computer programmers are doing the acting via mouseclicks. For Marty, a purest of cinema, to have this little respect for the purity of performance marks this as hypocrisy how he trashes blockbuster film. This is the theme park ride. This is a greatest hits tour through his oeuvre. This is uncanny directorial valley. I'm certain in 2050, you would get these old actors recreated exactly like this. That is our soulless future. Why rush to it? And the sad thing is, the cast were all there, and we will never get to see what they did. Clearly everyone is in denial and reviewing Scorsese's other works and pretending the emperor's wardrobe is just wonderful. When critics talk about the last half hour being a conscientious meditative coda on the gangster epic? Well sure, because they finally showed him acting. And it's not just that the CGI sinks the film, it's that it calls the entire thing into question and demands every other area perfect to make up for it, and can you honestly say the script and story is matching the perception of these rave reviews?"
24," Slow First Half, Masterful second half but overall should have been made 20 years ago
","The De-aging effect in the first half of the movie was very distracting and not really hiding well the old age of the main cast. Deniro, Pacino and Pesci all move and talk like old people...perhaps because they are old and some cgi can't fully hide that fact. The 2nd half of the movie on the other hand felt much more natural as the characters got older (no more distracting de-aging effect) and both the story and direction became A class. Scorsese did a great job creating tension and everyone else involved (actors, camera work etc.) gave their best.
If only this movie was made 20 years ago I'm sure it would have become a classic masterpiece without this annoying de-aging effect. As it is, this is a flawed masterpiece at best."
25," Almost Perfection
","Other reviewers at the top, when sorted by Helpfulness, have already covered much of what makes this film so exceptionally good. As such, and knowing that I have a tendency to sometimes exceed the number of allowed characters, I'd like to add just a couple of small things.First, the sets and costuming were near perfection. Every SINGLE piece of clothing which the characters wore, down to cuff-links, handbags, hair pins and shoes were of the era. That kind of meticulous detail can only bode well for a film. If the creators care enough about the small details, imagine what they do with the big ones.Secondly, in many films now, where there is a well-known and varied cast, you find that the screen time each devotes in comparison to the film run time, really leaves a little to be desired. That is not the case here. Almost every second of every scene is filled with one or more of these masterful actors, actually acting. Performing. Pulling you in to the world they are creating. All, without the need of heavy CGI or filler. As Hoffa might say: they get right down to brass tacks - and, pardon the pun, deliver.DeNiro, Pacino, Pesci, Keitel. Enough said. Leave politics at the door, and enjoy.Excellent film all around."
26," Unbelievably Bad
","Well, that was awful. If this excruciatingly long, pointless, meandering mess wasn't a Scorsese film and didn't include a famous, though ancient, cast, it would be getting universally panned. Seriously, what was the point? Three and a half hours of watching old men try to act like a bunch of bad-asses and I still don't get the point. That's three and a half hours I'll never get back."
27," To call it ""good"" is to call DaVinci a finger painter
",I'm going to steal something I read from a food critic once-this deserves a zero because it's so good it'll ruin everything else for you. And that's what this masterpiece is to cinema. It's truly just that effing special. It reminded me just how much I miss Pesci. Never in my life has time flown by as quickly as it did watching this. A true joy and a privilege to witness. Well done sirs. Well done.
28," I say it's dream come true for cinephiles
","Martin Scorsese's The Irishman is a magisterial mob epic...this movie is reflective more about greatness and losses. Finally Scorsese has brought the lost charm of gangster movies after so many years...but don't expect that this movie is treated with the same manner of Goodfellas..and the violence in this movie is not as extreme compared to his other movies in this genre, it's mainly focuses on the relation between Frank Sheeran and his boss Jimmy Hoffa..more like I say this is the ultimate gratitude to mob or gangster genre from the greatest living director with his competency.Robert De Niro gave his best performance in years..Pacino is electric, hope he will get his long deserved 2nd Oscar..Joe Pesci is real deal, he is not the desperado like in his other movies, in it he is sharp-witted quite sensible guy...when you see on these guys on screen you see the true power of art..The other cast members are also great.The film's first 30 or 40 minutes may be felt slow by some people but from when Hoffa kicks in, there is no turning back..The Irishman is the best movie of the year for me so far and 2019 is going to be one of the greatest years in movie history."
29," Unwatchable. Am I living in a parallel reality?
","At this point I'm sure all these positive reviews are bots paid for. There's no other explanation. This movie is absolutely unwatchable. One of the dullest pieces of cinema ever made since... well, since Scorcese's Silence (2016). I honestly do not have the faintest idea how anybody can enjoy this crap. Am I in a parallel reality?"
30," Self Indulgent Nonsense
","A group of 70-something year olds trying to act tough. Watching De Niro's lame attempts at cleaning up the streets (roughing people up that are half his age) was as much a farce as his and Pacino's acting in this crap. The dialogue comes off as ""hey, what clever things can we say because the camera is on."" Nothing comes off natural here. You want Hoffa? Check out Nicholson in Hoffa which was directed by De Vito. This? Please. Scorsese attempts his best to polish a crap... we all know it can't be done. If you insist on seeing it, Pesci's character is good. His performance trumps the rest. Very much a letdown otherwise."
31," A mafia movie that takes the time to talk about different topics in life
","Martin Scorsese grew up making gangster movies, for over 40 years he became the mainstay of modern gangster movies, along with Coppola marked a before and after in the genre, Scorsese immortalized gangster movies with Mean Streets, Goodfellas and Casino, films full of moral dilemmas, corrupt and proud characters and the typical final act of the film of the descent into misery. The Irishman brings all these elements together in a more existentialist and reflective way, despite being a movie about the mafia it feels more two-dimensional than most crime movies, especially because it is a very personal story told by Scorsese himself, unlike most mafia movies, The Irishman takes time to reflect on the passage of time, repentance, devotion, loyalty, and oblivion, all these doubts drown Scorsese and the main actors of the film who they have reached old age and are reflecting on their own lives.The Irishman has all the features of the Scorsese cinema, long shots, sharp and precise dialogues and dynamic camera movements, every time there is a shooting Scorsese manages to make it look more stylized than the previous one, we all know that the scenes of the Scorsese movies where the violence overflows are excellent, except for the scene of Frank kicking a man in the wax, De Niro's performance is quite disappointing considering that he is a 78-year-old man playing someone in his thirties. Like any Scorsese film, the story is marked by one betrayal after another, the mafia world is not the best to trust other people, loyalty is ephemeral, except that of Russel and Frank that is maintained until the end, when someone makes mistakes the mafia has no other solution than death, Frank was on the verge of making mistakes on multiple occasions but Russel was always there to rescue him as a sign of his true loyalty.The Irishman has an unconventional epilogue for the Scorsese films, we are used to seeing a spiral descent by the characters into madness or misery, or in both directions as is the case with Goodfellas. The Irishman for his part presents a reflective, emotional, sad and cold epilogue, Frank is alone in an old age telling us his story but continues to remain faithful to his ideals, this is demonstrated when he prefers not to tell the police about Jimmy Hoffa even after that all the mafia he knew is dead, that is his loyalty to his religion, the mafia.There are several peculiar scenes in this epilogue filled with a strong emotional charge, the ending leaves a strange feeling of mixed feelings, nostalgia, euphoria or confusion, but above all satisfied when seeing a film that refreshes the current cinema as only Scorsese could have done."
32," Can I get my deniro back?
","Just paid to watch this film and feel like I've been robbed by all the blatantly fake reviews on here.
I actually thought actors were supposed to pretend to be the characters they played? Especially as it was based on a true story.
Pacino was Pacino and De Niro was De Niro. Maybe these aged actors have become too big that now you only see them as themselves or maybe they are out of touch or too egotistical to try something different. It like eating plain cornflakes everyday of your life, if you've have had one bowl then you know what's coming. Also speaking of forever, it was like Scorsese was desperately trying to fill in the gaps with long drawn out scenes , the 30 mins of irrelevance at the end and menial tasks like standing in a queue being shown.
This film reminds me of watching your uncle get up to dance at a party thinking he's funny. It's been done a thousand times, everyone is bored and it lasts forever.
Self indulgent dross. If you feel like you have to watch which as a film fan you will, watch on Netflix over a week. Preferably at night do it can put you to sleep."
33," Simply Brilliant
","I was worried about the length of the film before i attended the screening, but i can honestly say, i was gripped all the way through, De Niro back to his best, Pesci was fantastic, Pacino was electric, Keitel was menacing & Stephen Graham held his own amongst this legendary cast.A return to this world that Scorsese has mastered with some of his best films & this film sits right up there right next to them.Get comfy & enjoy the great story telling ability of these masters at work."
34," Don't waste your time
","If you were hoping for an other kind of Goodfellas, like me, well I have to tell you this one is a letdown. A three and half hour long letdown. The story is boring as hell and there's little to no character development. You just can't seem to care about what happens after an hour into the movie, because it's hard to sympathize with any of the uninteresting characters."
35," Scorsese's Second Best Film
","Goodfellas is the third greatest film ever made; just after Godfather II and I (in that order). Those rankings put The Irishman at #4 all time. I've watched it at four times, and it grows on me more each time."
36," All past their best
","Too long, ageing effects are laughable in most of it and all the actors past their prime. Save yourself nearly 4 hours and rewatch Goodfellas instead"
37," Love this movie
","""The Irishman"" runs for three and a half hours, with an epic story that spans time and features many characters. Its main story revolves around frank, who becomes a gangster killer. Through frank's lens, we revisit the Kennedy era in the United States, and the Mafia and political dynamics of that era."
38," Mind-numbing
","Hands-down one of the most boring films ever made. An amazing achievement given the quality of the actors.Unless you enjoy watching the intricacies of union politics, don't bother watching it."
39," Old men
","Eighty year old men playing 25 to 60 year old men.
They walk and move like old men, plus it is a b.s. story.
Martin, you should have picked a different story for your reunion.
Other than that, nice cars."
40," Really really good
","Amazing acting, great story lines and some twists. Loved how the story was told through the eyes of De Niro's character as he was at the end of his life.For anyone that likes gangster movies, it is worth a watch - high quality actors from across the great gangster films. The only negative is that it lasts 3.5 hours. This would put me off watching it again soon, but definitely worth seeing for the first time.Kept me glued throughout - defo give it a watch. You won't be disappointed."
41," Goodfellas Turning Over in its Grave
","At an epic run-time of over three hours, you'd think director Martin Scorsese would make something more liken to an addictive limited cable series than an epic about absolutely nothing. It is, however, about someone, and that's Jimmy Hoffa played by a CGI-youthful Al Pacino, who, with Robert De Niro as sidekick ""house painter"" i.e. assassin Frank Sheeran, are involved in endless dialogue leading absolutely nowhere...Unlike Scorsese's mob classic GOODFELLAS, ironically playing-out like binge crime serials do now... with something to anticipate around every suspenseful corner... there's nothing to look forward to here except more and more conversations with De Niro on cruise control, and Pacino using a fake accent that's not only distracting but completely unnecessary.Narrated by a slightly more aged than he's already aged De Niro, rock-skipping through short, uneven portions of the past, the tech-rendered faces look somewhat young but the bodies are as stiff as genuine old fogies: like watching Redd Foxx as Fred Sanford wearing a 1930's-era James Cagney or Edward G. Robinson mask...Meanwhile, the continuous wrap-around section involves an afternoon drive with De Niro and Joe Pesci's powerful but overall pointless mobster Russell Bufalino, and there are a few new expository devices, perhaps to deviate from GOODFELLAS and CASINO: Like every mobster introduced with words flashing on the screen telling when and how they're eventually killed. It's not entirely clear why this happens other than to remind us who the movie's about, or that no one else actually matters...And yet, backed by the usual Scorsese jukebox of vintage rock/soul tunes while peppered with rushed bouts of ultra-violence, we learn even less about the doomed union leader than in Danny DeVito's limp Jack Nicholson as HOFFA biopic: proof that the man's legacy has nothing to do with his story, because he obviously doesn't have one worth telling, or watching."
42," Several Oscar nominations incoming
","The Irishman is another outstanding Scorsese film. De Niro gives one of his best performances in years. His narration is spot on and he makes us genuinely feel for Frank Sheeran. I believe his first Oscar nomination for years is inbound. Pesci is also great in a somewhat reserved role, but it's Al Pacino that really shines in this film. He gives his typical loudmouth performance and should be considered the favourite for best supporting actor, in my book. The film has a good pace to it. The nearly three and a half hour runtime flies by... for the most part. Midway through the second act, things can get a little slow but by no means is it boring. Perhaps it's the kind of film you watch on Netflix rather see it in cinema. The character development overall is excellent. We get a good grasp of every character by the end of the film due to the run time. However, we don't hear a huge chunk of information regarding Frank's Irish background. It is merely mentioned with one or two references. I personally had no issue with the de-aging. I think it's done really well. At no point was I distracted or thought it looked unrealistic. The ending and/or final act as a whole is conclusive. You leave the cinema with a smile on your face. I see a best picture nomination incoming for The Irishman. You should check it out when it comes to Netflix November 27. 9/10"
43," Long, but Good Movie for 2019
","Nominations at this point are inevitable as much as its detractors have pushed for it with their superficial criticisms- it's too long, and the actors are too old, etc. Joe Pesci is the one definite in my opinion that deserves an Oscar. He is just superb in his role in this. Pacino and Deniro are good to decent, but not award-worthy, also imo.I liked it and can see why it will get nominated, but it falls short of other mobster greats like Goodfellas. It is a quality mobster movie with a touch of ""Netflix"", which of course will diminish the quality."
44," It's too long and they are too old
","When we went to the start of the Irishman's career, I was honestly baffled a couple of times. What motivates this senior man to start stealing and hanging out with mobsters at his age? Is this young girl in his household his granddaughter? And they are now christening a newborn... his own?! De Niro was in mid-seventies so his character was at least 40 years younger! Makeup and visual effects can only do so much, he looks 55-60 in his ""youth"".It was a bizarre decision not to use a younger actor. Imagine Godfather II with 50 year old Marlon Brando playing his young self. That would be a smaller age difference. One of the most problematic scenes is when the Irishman's De Niro beats up a grocery store owner. He jogs stiffly instead of running and attacks the grocer with all the realism of a pro wrestling fight. I couldn't help but remember James Caan's savage street beating of Gianni Russo in Godfather I. Compared to that, this was pathetic.The movie is also unnecessarily long. You could cut an hour out and improve the pace. Too many slow scenes, discussions that don't advance the plot, driving around... For instance, there's a wedding of two characters we don't see elsewhere in the movie and we go to a slow motion study of the faces, dresses and so on. Why even show the wedding, let alone in slo-mo?On the positive side, the cast is all great actors and when they play their own age, they are perfect. It's a decent crime story but I don't see it becoming a classic, despite all the effort to make it 'epic'."
45," Long Time Fan of Marty
","This movie dissapointed me. I don't know if it was cause I saw how many amazing reviews there were or the countless good things I heard about the editing. This movie is slow. I mean so slow I had to write my first review on IMDb. There were some beautiful scenes when it came to the dialogue I.e the fish scene but because the actors in this movie are so old they are not able to do anything else other than just sit in a room and talk. I would say 3 hours of this movie is just Talking heads and the other half hour of this movie is people getting shot in the head. Marty is my favorite director but I'm not going to sugar coat this movie like everyone else seems to be doing. There needed to be a lot more cut from the movie and I'm not just talking about plot there are ungodly pauses where the actors Bob/Joe/Al are just staring off into space. This movie takes slow burn to a whole new level, Tarkovsky would even feel like this movie is paced terribly because there was so much that didn't matter. You could actually cut the first 45 minutes of the movie and the rest of it would still make complete sense. I hope people don't regard this as one of his best movies because that would be an injustice to his legendary films that changed cinema."
46," The long good-bye
","By the time we got to the wood chipper spewing out body bits, I had my metaphor for The Irishman - it was as if Scorsese had taken Goodfellas, Casino, Mean Streets, Raging Bull, Taxi Driver, and The Sopranos, put them all into an industrial sized shredder, and concocted this bloody blob of a film.
Long gone are the young Vito Corleone and Michael Corleone of Godfather II, (and the much ballyhooed ""de-aging"" effect doesn't bring them back.) But they are replaced by an Al Pacino who morphed into John Turturro and a Robert De Niro who has deteriorated into a sad parody of his former self. Who would have thought that Joe Pesci would be the shining star of this acting troika, but he has the one decent performance in this dreadful picture.
I didn't read the book the film is based on but the script is terrible. One example of many is Frank Sheeran's (De Niro in the title role) daughter character, played by Anna Paquin as an adult. She seems to be the only one of the four daughters and two wives who suspects that daddy may be a monster. Although she has hardly any lines, we can tell she hates him by the many repetitive scenes of her giving Frank death-ray stares. And it makes this cold-blooded killer feel really bad (calling Tony and Meadow Soprano! But at least Meadow had dialogue, a personality, and a nuanced relationship with her father.)
And speaking of dialogue, the various conversations between De Niro and Pacino (Jimmy Hoffa) and/or Pesci (a gangster whose name I've already forgotten) are beyond absurd in the nonsensical, elliptical way they speak as they keep putting out hits on their rivals.
While I'm passing out the raspberries, Robbie Robertson's musical score seems like it was written for another film entirely. But at least they used In the Still of the Night a couple of times and don't miss the short bit of Steve Van Zandt playing Jerry Vale singing Al di La in the mandatory night club scene.
And perhaps the final insult is that after three and a half hours of this mess, Frankie, we hardly knew ye."
47," A Magnum Opus
","The Irishman is one of the best stories put to film in years. Al Pacino looked in his prime. De Niro Pesci and everyone else is as good as youd expect. The cgi deaging is revolutionary. Truly seamless. The 3.5 hour runtime is heavily felt, but totally worth it
To that, I say bravo to Marty Scorsese"
48," A Master Class in Film-making
","Seen this afternoon at the NYFF.This film will doubtless go down as ""The Godfather"" of its generation, with Pacino and De Niro both on hand to assure continuity. Neither of them has done anything remotely as brilliant as this in decades, and the great revelation of the film, Joe Pesci, hasn't done anything at all. It has taken Scorsese's alchemy, back at its peak, to bring the three of them together in ways that surpass the sum of their considerable parts.Although (or because?) much of the film concerns the bleakness of old age, each of them, Scorsese included, is here restored to his astonishing peak capacity: the film's dirty little secret is that much of its substance concerns the process of human subsidence and movement toward the grave (some -- many -- more expeditiously than others, of course, with titles accompanying the first appearance of so many of the minor characters to tell us , laconically, in which appalling way this was accomplished), its principals seem to have discovered the fountain that restores, if not their youth, at least their youthful talents and energy, albeit with a world-weariness that we should all heed.Don't worry about the film's amazing length -- it goes by at warp speed, and if if not for slowing down of its own accord (and logic) in its final half hour, you may feel deprived by how swiftly it is dispatched.The professional reviews. out today, make much of the digital ""de-aging"" that allows the principals to be portrayed in early and late middle age, as well as closer to their natural ages. I confess that I don't see a problem with this, nor, I suspect, will most viewers. Under Maestro Scorsese's baton, all of them are fully convincing at each of these phases of life.Interestingly, it is De Niro (who played the young Vito Corleone) to whom the elegiac moments, poignantly and all-too-realistically portrayed, are given, whereas it is Pacino, to whom those unforgettable solo moments as the middle-aged Don were given, whose role here ends as it began -- in the total intoxication and lack of self-awareness of the powerful and unscrupulous. Pesci's self-awareness and watchful, controlling understanding of the realities of power, obviates the need for introspection -- he never wavers in his understanding of where the chess pieces stand on the board, and how they must, inevitably, be moved, and only fleetingly does he seem to perceive the cost of all that. Far more than his past scenery-chomping roles for Scorsese and others, Pesci's character here is, in this sense, the most terrifying figure in the film.The political messages are oblique (history unfolds largely in the background, on TV sets), but the core Scorsese message about the utter corruption of American life and the impossibility of combating this -- if only because the alleged watchdogs, up to and including Presidents, are , in turn, so easily corrupted -- comes through loud and clear. It's hardly an original message, but Scorsese (like Coppola before him) dissects these dynamics with exquisite precision. The message for our current politics couldn't be clearer, or scarier.Mention must be made of the flawless ensemble cast which backs up these principals, including the amazing women, who play such important, but background roles. (In mob films, as in Catfish Row in the great revival of ""Porgy and Bess"" now at the Metropolitan Opera, ""a woman is a sometime thing."" )I feel privileged to have been present at one of the first public screenings of a film that will certainly join the pantheon. But I must get back to see it again and again, such is the richness contained in almost every frame and sequence."
49," Scorsese's tribute to his own past pictures
","Way too long and hardly worth the effort. Very much a less interesting tribute version of Goodfellas or Casino, sure it has good production values, with the exception of the de-aging that never looks too convincing. Acting is capable but never noteworthy or memorable and it genuinely feels like it should have been made in the mid to late 90's when De Niro and Pacino were at the top of their game, because there is an undeniable sense of limitation due to their age. The story is far from gripping and poorly paced, it never really raises any intrigue or interest surrounding the disappearance of Hoffa. I personally would recommend Danny De Vito's ""Hoffa"" starring Jack Nicholson, a far superior film about Jimmy Hoffa and his disappearance. It is understandable as to why this film spent so long in development and struggled to get produced and distributed."

","I don't like De niro's political rants but I will not allow them to influence my respect of great acting, directing and storyline. This had all those in spades and didn't need fast cuts and fast action. You enter their world and the cold reality of a gangsters less glamorous side bares it soul and it's a sad but poignant reality. Excellent nuanced acting make this a true masterpiece of cinema. Do not miss this film!!!"

56," Scorsese Tips His Hat to Us All
","Saw this on the 10th November, Met and Exceeded my expectations.

Has to be seen in the cinema, and by heck does it plod along at a lovely pace.
Fantastic piece of Cinema at this stage of their careers, and the likes of which we will never see again."
57," Is this a joke?
","So I'm to suspend disbelief that with CGI Deniro is supposed to be a 30 year old man, Pesci refers to him as ""kid"" in one scene. Huh? Though the CGI was good enough to make him look like he was maybe in his mid 50s in the face, his body movements were definitely that of a geriatric. And what, Pesci and Pacino were supposed to be in their 40s? Cause this was the age of the real life people these actors were portraying in the 1950s. Hogwash! They couldn't just get younger actors, could they?Look, I'm not a die hard Deniro or Pacino fan. I'm not even a gangster movie fan, I love Scarface and The Departed and that's pretty much it. Both of those movies had long run times, though not nearly as long as this one, but they were entertaining and easy to sit through. Not quite an hour into this film and I was checking the time. Maybe that affects my rating as well, since this isn't my genre, though the CGI takes this movie way down in notches regardless of the types of films you like.Not to say this is necessarily a 1 Star film, but I needed to curb all the 10 star ratings that go on about how this is the best movie ever. Not even close!"

The story is a journey, a complex journey, so buckle up and enjoy the ride."

","You choose a film based on the recognition of your favorite producer and actors, entering the theatre fantasizing the fantastic mobster story you are about to watch and trat your soul for at least a week with the top notch masterpiece once again created by the artistic mind of Scorsese. You are sitting on your seat getting amazed by the great make up and the location sets and great performance of Robert DeNiro for the the first 15 mins, nevertheless the excitement and admiration begins to fade as the story becomes dull and does not add much original twist to a classic mobster story. The personal life of the main characters such as the divorce or the daughters seem to be intended to bring a humane sensation to the story however it seems to have massively failed. Peggy does not bring much of a loving touch to the story I'm afraid.In summary the film was a let down by movie legends."
62," De Niro Playing De Niro....again
","I found this film overly long and pretty boring, although Joe Pesci was pretty good. How many times though do we have to watch Robert De Niro playing the same character. It doesn't matter if it's the Godfather, Stardust or Frankenstein he always acts the same."
63," This is an insult
","Everyone in this film must have realized they were taking part in a stupid exercise to fool themselves. This is a swan song, a last hurrah reunion for the old gang before they head out to pasture. Yet it's not interesting, and not engaging, and not believable. Think this is a masterpiece? Uh no. It's embarrassing, and a disgrace to all the talent. Why didn't Scorsese just use different actors to play characters who are supposed to be four decades younger???? That is four decades younger! It would have been more compelling to see a real progression, instead of waxy and weird CGI mannequins. It's distracting and frankly, disgusting, to pretend otherwise."
64," Martin Scorsese Meets Orson Wells
",After watching the Irishman I kept thing of the movie the Magnificent Ambersons very detailed long drawn out scenes and storylines I was pleasure to watch.
65," So Much Ado About Nothing
","The Irishman isn't a bad movie. Actually, it's beautifully made and, from a narrow filmmaking perspective, it is flawless. However, something is missing from this movie--something which isn't missing from Scorsese's early gems such as Taxi Driver, After Hours, or Casino--namely: ""mission."" The Irishman lacks mission. For over three hours I was floored with spectacular cinematography and state-of-the-art acting by De Niro, Joe Pesci, and Al Pacino. But once the credits hit the screen, I felt cheated, shortchanged. The Irishman is well-made, but it is easily forgettable. I cannot think of a single scene or theme that has stuck with me from this whole visual epic. It somehow feels like a watered-down version of another movie which got lost somewhere."
66," waaaaay to long
","It's the same old story, seen it before, not sure about what's the big deal here; the rise of an Italian-american mafia hit man told as a reminiscence by him. Sure the acting is excellent, how can it not be with a cast like this. Buts that's about it, zero novelty in the narrative, at times really slow and even irritating.
The end, by which I mean the last hour and a half, could easily be 30 minutes instead."

","Trite, lack of original thought, boring and way too long - we didn't even finish the movie. Big time DUD of a movie!"
68," CRINGE BOMB/Excruciating
","All the bad reviews are 100% true and accurate. At 46, Of course I've always loved Scors., & ALL these actors. But this was just a horrid waste. Senseless, no need. But, mind-boggling as to why he didn't use any number of dozens of terrific actors in their 30s-40s to portray the guys in the early years. The ENTIRE film was so difficult to sit through. It certainly cheapens The Godfather's, Goodfellas, Casino, Raging Bull, etc. All these guys in their late 60's-early 80's, omg it's sad & pathetic. Sry, NOT sry. I just watched silly Jack&Jill- Pacino cracked me up. Dirty Grandpa w/ DeNiro & Zac Effron..stupid but hysterical. The film w/DeNiro & Anne Hathaway where he plays a retired intern was charming. HOWEVER, too bad they didn't realize they had no business doing another gangster flick!! SHAME. I'd DEF Recommend skipping. You're not missing anything. I promise."
69," 25 minutes in, I knew this movie was BS...I finished it...after 4 months of trying.
","Where is the 1/2 star button?I'm sure I will go back and watch the rest of the movie, but after 25 minutes, between the poor CGI, the obvious rehashing of voice over, ham handed soundtrack, and blatant, not even distortion, but complete lying regarding history, as is commonplace in any Marty film, I had to turn it off. To the point that I watched, it was a boring retread of a formula. Maybe worse.
As I said before, I know I will go back to watch the rest of the not so much cinematic, but very franchise like directing. But for now, 25 minutes in, this movie was BS."

","This is simply not a good movie, for all the reasons clearly spelled out in the negative reviews here. The glowing reviews calling it a 'masterpiece' are beyond bizarre.A too long, boring story- told lazily. Bad writing. Terrible CGI.The scene outside the grocery store says it all. Deniro is supposed to be a tough guy in his prime and yet he looks like an old man trying to unsuccessfully kill a junebug on a shuffleboard court.Slapping young faces on stiff, arthritic senior citizens was a very poor decision.And even if it did work, it still wouldn't have saved this POS."

DeNiro has basically one facial expression now, a grimace, and even Joe Pesci can't save the scenes they're in together.
THREE HOURS long, when a tightly edited and less self-conscious 90 minutes would have made for a more interesting film.
This movie tries so hard to be IMPORTANT that it's actually painful at times."
73," Extremely over rated garbage
","Oh my good!!
Seriously??
This movie is a complete garbage and waste of time.
Acting of those so called great actors is just so wooden and boring.
Robert De Niro has always been boring, he always does the same acting where this movie once again shows nothing has changed.The only good thing in this movie is Joe Pesci."
74," Just boring
","It is amazing how people are still fascinated with the mob ""culture"" and history. To me, this film reminded a chewing gum that has been chewed on for so long that it lost all the flavor. The story and acting are plain boring, and I was able to only watch the first 1.5 hour before literally falling asleep. I wonder if all these mob-praising movies by Scorsese were heavily sponsored by mafia - this is the only explanation for all the crap about romantics of the mob that was put on the screen. Reminds me of how the prison culture was semi-officially praised in the former USSR, later becoming integrated into the pop culture of modern Russia."

If you get to a point in this film that you feel you should have walked out already, just go, it doesn't get any better.

I'm not even giving this a 1 star to balance out all the 10 star delusional people, it's genuinely that terrible!"
77," Long, Dull and Self-Absorbed
","I was super excited to see this and it was a total bore. It was ridiculously and unnecessarily long and there was nothing new here - Pacino, De Niro and Pesci playing the exact same characters they have played in every mafia movie before this. Scorcese may be a legend but the pace and storytelling here dragged on and on. There is a good chance Hoffa's body will be discovered before this movie actually ends."
78," Long, with a pointless storyline
",The movie is 3.5 hours long and goes on building up characters and in the end goes no where. There is no great plot or story.
79," A Film for Idiots
","After looking forward to this film for a long time, after 30 minutes I managed to see through my rose tinted spectacles and Scorsese, that this film is self indulgent, boring and 2 hours too long. A pretty simple plot is dragged out over the course of 3 and a half hours, fleshed out with mind numbing dialogue, which is only broken up with occasional 'jokes', which are just as the stupid as the audience for laughing at them.Scorsese repeats pretty much everything in this film, from the performances of the actors, to the one liners, aswell as the camera moves. The steadicam loop that is used over and over again, gets nearly as boring as De Niro's performance as he uses the same expression for the 1000th time.This film has Netflix producers written all over it. ""Lets get Marty and De Niro back together again"". I should have known better than to sit through this dross (only hoping it would get better) from De Niro's movie choices over the last few years. I'd rather watch meet the fockers, knowing full what im getting, rather than feel like I'd been sold a dead horse by Netflix under the pretence of some big names.Please don't waste your time on this, it really is for idiots, evidenced by all the positive reviews on here. The emperors new clothes springs to mind..."
80," More than a gangster film
","The Irishman is an epic story of rising to power in the Mob's reality. It doesn't stop there, however, and this is what makes it more than another film of its genre. It provides a sublime contemplation on morality, it searches for a point of ruthless behaviour and a point of a professional career itself."
81," A Story as Old and Tired as Its Cast
","This is the death of mafia movies... forever. The entire ordeal is so stale that it's creepy. Watching this movie is like listening to the life story of an old derelict, like you're hearing things you'd rather not know. The appeal of the gangster story is completely vacant, almost like a documentary on the real mafia, one that makes you feel scuzzy just for watching it."
82," Worst movie of 2019
","An absolute turkey of a movie - this movie doesn't deserve a rating and be warned it will put you to sleep, YES it is that boring."
83," I don't get how critics loved this movie
","I am a HUGE Scorsese fan but in my opinion this is his worst film to date. Right from the beginning De Niro is not believable as Frank Sheeran. His movements because of his age are so restricted that it's almost comical. There was some good acting in this movie and 2 performances stood out to me. Stephen Graham and Joe Pesci were very impressive, also the actor who portrayed 'Fat' Tony Selerno was very good as well. Overall I gave this a 5 out of 10. It probably deserved a 6 out of 10 but I was so disappointed because it was a Scorsese film I couldn't go above a 5."
84," Very disappointing
","I had great expectations of this film which featured a stellar cast which should have been enough to make this a great film, but it was slow and dull and lacked the dynamics and action of Goodfellas. The facial makeup was awful with De Niro and Pacino looking like they had succumbed to LA botox. It should be renamed The Geriatric Mob. One of the worst Scorsese films I've ever watched."
85," If this is real cinema then I don't need it
","Boring as simple as that this dosen't come close to goodfellas or casino. I think Martin thought that if I make movies boring people will watch it and praise it.
It is very long and I still watched it in one go and felt horrible about myself"
86," A long, drawn out, dull watch!!
","If you have 3 and half hours spare please dont watch this.. watch a box set or a trilogy. It would be more meaningful and enjoyable than this dross of this unfulfilled pensioner gangster movie.Deniro fights a store manager outside a store towards the start of the movie, it looks like your grandad trying to swing for fruit from an apple tree. its painful to watch all the way through, stories jolting from present day to the past without any clear referencing and the slow paced action and feeling of 70 year olds gangster ""mob"" felt outdated and nothing accustomed to a Scorsese classic.Avoid avoid avoid!"
87," Ugly men's
","Why should we watch 80+ men looked liked 50+
Most boring movie of the decade.
Everything is known.
Taxi driver de niro could do any things.
Hoffa Pacino will cross every level of overacting.
This is 3 and half hrs movie, atleat give role of earlier time to youngsters. Their facial marks which revealed 80+, however hard Scorsese tried to hide has made movie unwatchable.
So now director of this movie should understand before criticising, superheroes never go old but ur heroes have become ugly making ur movie ugly.
Gangster movie heroed by ugly old men"
88," Too long, too old.
","The main actors were good back in the day but these guys are too old, I'm sorry. I grew up loving Goodfellas, The Godfather, Casino, etc, but too many of these guys are way too old for these kind of rolls. Al Pacino did a great job thou, and he was on point. This movie was also way too long; it took me a couple of sitting just to finish it, and I fell asleep both times."
89," just skip the first half with the cgi dinosaurs
","They just overdone it with the digital botox, especially on deniro in the first half of the film. I felt like I was watching some sort of jurrassic park. deniro and pacino only start to act and stop looking like some computer game avatars in the second half. pesci us just a shadow of himself.the script is rather bland, boring story watching grumpy old men. the characters dont open up to the audience, theres is always too much distance. boring dialogues without tension. women actually dont play any role.scorsese should have cut the first half and shorten the movie to 100 minutes, ir produce a mini series."
90," Oh Brother..
","Where do I start. The acting by Pacino and De Niro is wooden. These guys have been miscast at times but never more than here as they should be long retired. I do understand that they are looking for Scorsese to revitalize their careers but come on. The reverse aging effects are obvious and distracting. The story is vanilla and the editor decided to take a vacation. So much of the film is filler that I strongly contemplated leaving about 2/3 into it. This gets my vote for the worst film of the year so far. Sure, you could go see this film, you could also steer your car with your feet but it doesn't make it a good idea. You've been warned."
91," Worth the wait.
","After anticipating this like a madman for nearly a decade, I'm glad to confirm that all my hopes and dreams came true and it's a masterpiece.The storytelling structure is mostly in the same vein as GoodFellas and Casino, but with much more room to breathe (which makes sense when you consider the runtime). Less needle drops, more contemplation. Many brilliant scenes, some very intense moments, an insane amount of hilarious moments... and of course Scorsese directs the absolute hell out of it.Frank Sheeran, while being a bit of an enigma, is easily the most introspective Scorsese mob character ever. And the final 30 minutes or so are an aftermath we've never seen before in a Scorsese crime film.And De Niro, Pacino, and Pesci are all absolutely brilliant. The talk of De Niro being internal and Pacino being external was kind of right, but De Niro also has many funny, charismatic, and noticeably intense moments. Arguably his best moment comes in what may be the most awkward phone conversation in the history of film. Pacino, as you'd expect, nails all of the Hoffa speeches but also has rarely been this funny. And flawlessly portrays Hoffa's desperation (or... brazen lack thereof). Pesci is nowhere near the ""go f- your mother mode"" many were probably expecting. He's kind of the wise old man of the movie, while also being an ice cold mob boss. If he stays in retirement after this, it'll certainly be one of the GOAT swan songs. The film heavily relies on Sheeran's relationship with both Hoffa and Bufalino, and it wouldn't succeed nearly as well as it does without these three actors.Stephen Graham, Bobby Cannavale, and the legend Harvey Keitel are the only other cast members that really get a chance to shine... and they all bring it with limited screentime.And enough can't be said about Thelma's editing here. The film somehow flies by while also feeling like a lifetime... Frank's lifetime. I'm not sure the power of the final act would hit quite as hard if you weren't somewhat exhausted by everything that came before it.The culmination of many careers, and a film for the ages."
92," Far too long, but the existential and eschatological elements make up for it
","Based on the 2004 book by Charles Brandt, ""I Heard You Paint Houses"": Frank ""The Irishman"" Sheeran and the Inside Story of the Mafia, the Teamsters, and the Last Ride of Jimmy Hoffa, written for the screen by Steven Zaillian, and directed by Martin Scorsese, The Irishman is about aging, loss, taking stock, regret. To a certain extent, it is to the gangster genre what The Searchers (1956) was to the classic western. One of the best-reviewed films in years, although I certainly don't disagree that it has (many) masterful elements, I felt it's just too long. Shorten it by just 20 minutes in the mid-section and you have a masterpiece. Now, don't get me wrong, I have no problem with long films - I'm a fan of pictures such as The Godfather: Part II (1974), Once Upon a Time in America (1984), Dances with Wolves (1990), The Tree of Life (2011), Potop (1974), and Sátántangó (1994) (all 442 minutes of it). However, such length has to be narratively justified, and I just felt that in The Irishman, it wasn't, with the film's 206 minutes occasionally feeling padded and (dare I say it) self-indulgent. Nevertheless, the acting is universally superb, the directing is more contemplative than we've seen from Scorsese in a while, Thelma Schoonmaker's editing is predictably awesome, and Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography is flawless.The film opens in 2003 as we meet an elderly Frank Sheeran (Robert De Niro) living in a nursing home and close to death. Wanting to go with something of a clear conscience, he begins speaking about his time as the go-to hitman for the Bufalino crime family in Pennsylvania. In 1954, Sheeran becomes friends with family patriarch Russell Bufalino (Joe Pesci), and soon, Bufalino has him carrying out various hits. Loyal to the family, and adept at his job, Sheeran quickly moves up the underworld ladder, and Bufalino introduces him to Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino). The president of the Mob-funded Teamsters union, Hoffa is facing federal investigation and is struggling to deal with rising teamster Anthony ""Pro"" Provenzano (Stephen Graham). Bufalino wants Sheeran to babysit the volatile, unpredictable, and confrontational Hoffa and try to keep him out of trouble. Hoffa and Sheeran hit it off, and soon Sheeran is Hoffa's unofficial bodyguard. However, as the years go by, Hoffa continues to antagonise his Mob backers, and some of them soon come to see him as more of a liability than an asset.Originally set at Paramount, when The Irishman's budget started pushing $150m before shooting had even begun, the studio dropped it. Then came Netflix, who not only put up the money, they also offered Scorsese a near unheard-of degree of creative control. Netflix's involvement is an interesting situation because here you have a film that simply could not have been made through the modern studio system (at least not in its current form). Many are predicting that streaming services such as Netflix will ultimately destroy the cinema industry entirely, but in this case, it's hard for a cinephile not to celebrate their salvaging such an ambitious and auteur-driven film. It was a great PR move, sure (and they really, really want a Best Picture winner in their catalogue), but it was also a massive financial risk. In terms of the real-life background to the film's narrative, most historians dismiss Sheeran's account of how important he was to the Bufalino family, maintaining he was a low-level goon with a drinking problem who was never assigned to any important task. Indeed, several of his claims have been explicitly proven as fabrications, and several people who knew him have stated he did none of the things he claimed.Irrespective of this, however, The Irishman is a film written in regret. Much of this is tied up in Sheeran's daughter Peggy (played by Lucy Gallina as a child and Anna Paquin as an adult). An almost completely wordless role, Peggy is introduced in a scene in which she watches her father viciously beat the grocer for whom she works because he pushed her, a scene which speaks to his sociopathy if not necessarily his psychopathology. The impression of him which this gives her is something Sheeran spends much of the rest of the film trying to ameliorate.Another important thematic element is that as each gangster appears for the first time, a subtitle tells us who they are, and lists the date of their deaths and how they were murdered. There's no better illustration of just how concerned the film is with the nature of transience - every single one of these guys is a colossus in their own mind, and each deems themselves invincible (as do we all when young). Yet none of them make it out of life alive. In the film's last act, this theme is distilled down to its very essence, essentially positing that the only important thing you leave behind is your relationships with other people, and Sheeran has badly mismanaged his, resulting in him sitting alone in a nursing home at Christmas. In Goodfellas (1990) and Casino (1995), the protagonists lose their wealth, possessions, and status, but in The Irishman, the loss is more existential - Sheeran loses his soul.As the violence settles and the zingers dry up, the film's last act is remarkably bleak in a way that the last acts of GoodFellas and Casino aren't, and as we watch Sheeran sitting in that nursing home, taking stock, spelling out his regrets, reminiscing about his actions as a young man, it's impossible not to see the meta dimension - Scorsese himself looking back on his career, remembering the classics of yesteryear, keenly aware that old-age is stalking him.In terms of the acting, the closest we get to a poor performance is Pacino, who portrays Hoffa as if he was playing, well, Al Pacino. Look at footage of the real Hoffa, then watch both The Irishman and Hoffa (1992) in which Jack Nicholson plays the character, and tell me who gives the more authentic performance. Don't get me wrong, Pacino is fun (I would gladly watch an entire film composed of nothing but him and Stephen Graham insulting one another), and most of the laughs come from his over-the-top antics, but it's not an especially accurate depiction of the real man. As for De Niro, this is his first not-phoned-in performance in decades, and he imbues the character with real interiority and complex psychology, without diluting the inherent inhumanity. However, the real standout performance is Pesci, although those looking for the fireworks of Tommy DeVito or Nicky Santoro will be disappointed, as this is literally the inverse of such performances. Bufalino is quiet, calm, considered, highly intelligent, but cold and sociopathic, the kind of man who wouldn't beat your head in, but would order someone else to do so without a second thought.If the film has a single problem, it's the runtime. As mentioned above, the last act is devastating; there's little tension as such, but there sure is pathos. However, by the time we got to this point, I was starting to feel the film had outstayed its welcome, when I should have been the most heavily invested in the story. This has been a recurrent problem in recent Scorsese films, but this is the first time he's strayed from over-long into self-indulgence. The film simply doesn't warrant this length; whole scenes could easily be removed without compromising the story, character beats, or emotion.Another problem, albeit a smaller one, concerns the digital de-aging. It's a little jolting at first, but easy to get used to. What stood out, however, was the tired bodies beneath those de-aged faces. This is most notable in the scene where Sheeran beats up Peggy's boss. Except the beating is pathetic - the kicks are about five miles away from the man's face and De Niro's exhausted stomps wouldn't flatten a wet cardboard box. It's a shame as, it's a good scene, but the lack of correlation between face and body is undeniably jarring. Another issue is one that has cropped up in all of Scorsese's Mob films - glorification. Obviously, The Irishman is about the toxic masculinity of this world and the lonely endgame (if one even gets to the endgame), but much as was the case with the (frankly stomach-churning) softening of Jordan Belfort in The Wolf of Wall Street (2013), Scorsese runs a very real risk of glamorising what he claims to be condemning.For me, The Irishman was a very good movie, but not the masterpiece many have felt it to be. But that's just me, and I can certainly recognise and celebrate such ambitious filmmaking, especially coming at a time when more and more it feels like films are being made by committees rather than by artists. Arguably Scorsese's most eschatological film, certainly since Kundun (1997), The Irishman is the story of how one man lost his soul, and, by extension how the world for which he lost it, dehumanises and degrades those who participate in its rites. Although Sheeran is brought down by old-age, abandonment, and the merciless nature of human existence, Scorsese refuses to afford him an easy out - he made his choices, and he must now live, and die, with the consequences."

Kept calling a 75-yr old fart as ""kid"" is another ground breaking script line that almost knocked me off my seat whenever it's delivered. M.S.'s directing career should be stopped right after this bummer. He's nostalgia of the Irish mobs and that era should also call a quit after this bore-to-death formulaic repeatedly stuffed turkey. He and these actors are like a wolf pack too old to hunt, but still tried so hard to cash in with nothing to show. He and these pathetic bunch are like a rich 80 years old rich Irish still trying so hard to get his 18 years old 6th new wife pregnant, even the doctor already told him he's just shooting blanks with no seeds.And, my, those annoying already played and played thousand times songs to imitate that era...those songs were like songs from ""The Sound of The Music"", if you broadcast these kinda songs 365/24/7 to the inmates on the death row, you don't have to waste bullets or cocktail poison for lethal injection, they'd be gonne crazy, either hanging themselves or crashing their heads to avoid this kinda music. But M.S. just loved it, 'cause it's like National Anthem to symbolize that dark era.All of these old gizzards and the director and those who've worked for him since day one, should all retire now.

Supposedly they spent $165 million on it. If that's true, I'm guessing that $164.9 million wet to pay the stars and do marketing. They spent nothing on the movie itself. The explosions look like something out of a 1980's TV series. Even worse, there is no drama, no excitement, nothing compelling in the script. Much has been made of how long the movie is. Don't worry about. Treat it like a mini series. This is not something that you will get sucked into and have to watch all at once."

","The rave reviews for this film just prove how blinded people can be by someone's past achievements.Boring story, boring script, feels very low budget in every aspect, the violent scenes were frankly embarrassing.Judging by this latest offering I think Scorsese has long since had his day, he should have left it alone at Boardwalk Empire and enjoyed his retirement.Hate to say it to be honest, but I can't see why anyone would rave on about this film.Drivel."
97," How to Turn a Fascinating Book Into a Dull Movie
","In the novel, before Frank Sheeran goes to war in 1941 and learns the art of killing too well, he enters a jitterbug dance contest and wins first prize. You won't see that humanizing scene in the movie however, you'll see a cardboard cutout of who the man really is-in poorly paced sequences and badly written dialogue with a dull soundtrack. In the book, Sheeran is 6 '2"" when he goes to war, when he returns he's 6'4""-he was not even fully grown when he went to war. Interesting detail left out and there are dozens. Sure, you can't put everything in a novel into the film but leaving out key parts that reveal so much about the main character is negligent filmmaking. I know you will watch this film if you're a film buff but you will be wanting your 3 1/2 hours back afterwards."
98," Nicholson Was So Much Better
","All right look. I enjoy watching the occasional films and shows about mob/gangster activity once in a while. I know that these are all subhuman scumbags that deserve nothing but contempt. But it is entertaining enough. The Departed, Casino, Goodfellas, Hoffa, The Godfather films, Blood in Blood Out. I enjoy the early Bogart and Cagney movies as well. Edmond O'Brien was a favorite of mine too. Sigh... then there is this.. this three and a half hour THING..Putting aside the ridiculous CGI that looked like nothing but a bunch of gratuitous botox injections, this film sucked in virtually every aspect besides production. 165 million for THIS??? De Niro and Pacino played themselves yet again (is there a record for doing this sort of thing?) The script was soooooo poor. My God! How many times can these characters go back and forth while saying THE SAME THING AND NOT PROGRESSING THE PLOT! Was there a plot?? De Niro must be the most overrated actor in recent memory. The scene where he stomps on a grocer's hand had me in tears. He looked like a geriatric who was desperately trying not to lose his balance. Scorsese is definitely partially to blame for this. How that entire scene did not fall to the cutting room floor is beyond me. De Niro has the same acting style since the 80s. Eyebrows up, corners of the mouth up. Eyebrows up, corners of the mouth down. Then he lowers his eyebrows and does the same thing. He laughs the same way as well. This is acting? I already mentioned that Pacino was Pacino in this. Good God was he ever. He was 100% Pacino and 0% Hoffa which equates to PaSTINKO! Aren't these actors supposed to actually TRY to be like the characters they are portraying? Hoffa was a real person. There is plenty of footage of the man talking, interviews, etc. What were Pacino and Scorsese thinking? Scorsese just lets Pacino HAM it up scene after scene after scene. Pacino is another actor who I find overrated as hell. He did some decent work in the 70s but he has also coasted since And Justice For All. The man just yells and looks bizarrely awkward while doing it. Staring off into space while bug eyed. Three and a half hours of this. Boring scenes, boring dialogue ""Did you talk to him? He did that? Talk to him again. Set up a meeting. You think so? Yeah. I dunno. You really think so? I dunno. Lets think about it. I thought about it. Really? Yeah. I think so."" And on.. and on.. and on.... Was Scorsese on a mission to murder the Mob genre with this? These cats need to retire. Just call it a career.. Quite honestly this was extremely painful to sit through. I had to break this thing up into three parts. This film offers nothing but a bunch of boring scenes and an awkward geriatric clown trying to pass himself off as Jimmy Hoffa. Shame on you Marty. You let this happen.Hoffa was done already. Danny De Vito directed Jack Nicholson in 1992. You want a real glimpse of how Hoffa actually talked and acted like? Watch that instead. Why was the Irishman even made? The answer is anybody's guess. AVOID AVOID AVOID... unless you need to get a good nap in immediately."
99," Unengaging, unnecessarily long with boring dialogues
","This is a film,cthat should never have been made. Pesci should never have come out of retirement. Way too long with unnecessary fillers of phone calls, airplane flights and road trip.Despite the computer modified age change, it cannot change the old man dynamic with slow non-engaging dialogue.The lack of female dialogue in the film screams at you like Deniro's attempt to show emotional expressions. Pacino is the same Pacino, who apprently can only swear using the word cocksucker. And the dragging, oh my God, the dragging to get to the uninvetable end.I never thought it would come to a stage where I was close to falling asleep a couple of times during a Scorsese movie."
100," Why, Scorsese, Why? An agonizingly long pointless waste of time.
","What a sad movie.
Not because it was supposed to be a cautionary tale of an old mobsters comeuppance.
Take off The Scorsese love googles and look at the reality of this painfully long, boring proven to be lies of an old alcoholic "" who never killed a fly.""
It went from an interesting, entertaining tall tale novel to this futile attempt at being interesting.Netflix spent 200 million on DeNiro's weird blue eyes and the old gangs flat facial expressions?
Their egos got the better of them all.Perhaps hiring younger actors to portray them in their youth?The Godfather. DeNiro brilliantly portraying Marlon Brando's Vito Corleone as a young man.
Did they all ""forget about it""?Pesci calling DeNiro a ""kid"" funny/sad.Apparently the power ego Scorsese's developed over his life time of masterful film making took over on this shoot because he was, yes was an extremely talented visionary in his genre of story telling and his ego drove his better judgement into a 3 and 1/2 hour ditch.""Rush the gun, run from the knife"" ?
""Take the gun, leave the cannoli"".
I prefer the original, dark humorous line.
That unoriginal dialogue was chewed to bits by Pacino.If this receives any Oscar, Emmy ect. nominations/awards, Hoffa is still alive and the fix is in.These reviews of 10's coming from NY, London Film Festivals ect., are by invitation only and mainly charity events, These people understandably wish to be invited back into the glitz and glamor next year or they're bots.There are no real critics anymore.
Only bloggers, paid for their reviews,
YouTube channels paid for views and fanboys.This movie was so hyped. I'd read the novel which was a lot more entertaining.
I was deflated after pushing through the first 2 torturous hours with a mere 1 and 1/2 hours to go.
For me, this wasn't a movie, it was a battle of my endurance to stay awake and finish this while hoping for something better.The pure waste of the talented women cast, why bother casting them at all?I couldn't suspend disbelief or become emotionally invested because
I was bogged down in bad dialogue, pointlessly long scenes w/o payoffs.
Apathy for all characters.I'd hoped for a great movie, not Good Fellas II, no repeats of the younger Scorsese and his crews glory days.We all change with time and I wanted this to be for the better.
Nostalgia fact: If any other director and cast put this movie out, I stand by the full knowledge that it would have been panned to the ground by real viewers.I truly wanted something original and riveting.
This was not to it.
Forgive me this one indulgence,
Take the cannoli, leave The Irishman."
101," Greatest con
","This reunion of the mob characters is just last time they can pick the dough. Movie is nothing extraordinary, Martin Scortese made same type of movie that he always made, it's a story told be the character about how he got involved with a mob, a like sad story of normal teen or man looking to make a extra buck. However these movies a glorifying behaviors that are barbaric in nature. And 3.5 hour time is overbearing, since you have to listen to monologue from either Al Pacino or Joe Pesci and character that DeNiro is staying on sidelines. He is suppose to be main character however he plays a guy who listens and then sometimes does things that lowlife bosses are impressed with. Hopefully this a last time I see these old farts together, unless a sequel gets made how the end up in hell, probably in one cell slicing garlic with razor and having those meaningless conversations."
102," Horribly long
","The movies starts in a quite pleasant way, after that it gets horribly slow and long no twists whatsoever.
The actors loose themselves in a long dialogues that are going nowhere.
Not sure given that is a Netflix production if is going to be in small episodes, therefore it could be digested in a longer period of time but I watched it at once and believe me I couldn't wait for it to end.
I even contemplated to leave the cinema before the end.
Very bad one don't waste your money."
103," Zzzzfellas
","The length of this borapalooza is not the problem. It's the frame after frame of pure, uninterrupted stupor that it produces. Snoozefellas.It doesn't matter that Scorsese directed it or that we have all enjoyed the brilliant work of De Niro, Pesci, Keitel, and Pacino over more than four decades. Someone involved in this ponderous production must have known that this film was a waste of time, money, and talent-and an assault on the viewing public, who had every reason to believe that this would be worth seeing. It is not, unless you want to lose your will to live.There is nothing-zero-worth seeing here-it would have been more entertaining watching these four icons go shopping at Costco."
104," Legends back on form, yet it just doesn't all add up for me
","It's a return to the tried & trusted formula for some of the greats of cinematic history. Scorcese directs in his familiar field of Italian American mafia & gangster life, and with Pacino, De Niro, Pesci and Harvey Keital all leading the film this is one of the most stellar casts of any film in many a year (if not ever). Ably assisted by more recent star names like Stephen Graham & Bobby Cannavale, it all bodes well.For me, De Niro and Pesci are giving their best roles for many years, possibly could be Oscar nominations.Yet I feel this just doesn't fully add up. So much good to say, in terms of direction, style, fashion, humour and realism but was quite self-indulgent, and Pacino was just faxing in the same shouty role he has done for years. The film is almost 3.5 hours long, and it feels like it, it could have been shortened without any loss.The storyline drags, and I only found it at its best in two areas. One was the relationship between De Niro's character and his daughter Peggy, and then the last hour as all came together. However, there's a lot to get to these points, and I was engrossed yet not always engaged. It's a slow burn gangster film, more about corruption centring round union man Jimmy Hoffa. Maybe Americans will find this more appealing than non-Americans, as they can relate & understand the full underlying politics relating to the characters.There is a lot of good to say, and Scorcese will have another hit on his hands. Recently he has criticised tent-pole films like the Marvel films for not being cinema, which is churlish. Cinema is a wide cross-section of story telling. Thankfully there is still room for films like 'The Irishman' but in truth I think it could have been just so much better. Not disappointing, just not a classic for me."
105," Way too long and boring
","If you compare this to the garbage that makes 99% of Netflix content, its masterpiece, but this movie is way too long (3.5h) and way too boring. No thriller, no suspense you would expect from a Scorsese movie, just plain old boring drama. It might be interesting for people who heard the story of Hoffa.Should you watch it? Sure if you don't have anything better than to waste 3.5h of your life on the mediocre move or you are a fan of Scorsese / DeNiro / Hoffman / Peschi as that's probably last or one of the last movies some of them will make.PS:
I would give 5 stary, yet +1 star for Joe Peschie as it's Christmas aka Home Alone movie time"
106," A Sleeper
","This movie is a great cure for insomnia. I fell asleep after 45 minutes, but doubt if I missed anything worth watching."
107," Enough Scorsese leftovers to give you agita
","Stylish, empty and overlong Martin Scorsese's Irishman is one long conversation featuring an exhausted looking Robert DiNero, a frail Joe Pesce and an over the top Al Pacino in a bad toupee. It's like watching the Marx Bros. in Go West, rusty ghosts of the past.The Irishman follows the career of close Jimmy Hoffa confidant and mobbed up hitman Frank Sheehan. Tied in with some of the greatest hits Scorsese provides a score card of casualties to buttress his film with historical fact and with snippets borrowed from the usual suspects, MeanStreets, Taxi Driver, Good Fellas, Casino. It is a veritable senior citizen version of Good Fellas.DiNero has not been able to carry a two hour film in twenty years and here we are asked to endure over three with a doughy and somewhat distorted Bobby looking old from the outset, his movements creaky, his delivery half hearted. A scene where he beats a grocer takes on an almost laughable WWE look as he huffs and puffs through some rage of yesteryear. Pacino starts well but wears thin. You just look at Joe Pesce and worry about his health. The wives wear loud clothes are vapid and loyal. The only energized and enthusiastic performance is delivered by Bo Dietl as union flunky Joe Glimco.Scorsese does apply lipstick on this hippo with a certain flair as his camera sweeps in on crane shots and he tracks more than Max Ophuls employing an excess of wide angle framing in order to showcase his nostalgic recreation while employing his signature aid of pop music and Fellini like mugs. It all leads however to DiNero's dense monotone narration and one close up after the next of tired old men in tough guy conversation a decade or two past their prime as actors. The Irishman is one stale bore."
108," Plastic faces, cliches and disappointment
","Let me start of by saying I am a massive fan of the genre, scorcese and all the actors involved. The movie is filled to the brim with incredibly talented actors. So I expected a lot. Maybe too much. It's a scorcese mafia film after all.So? unfortunately, it is a massive disappointment to me. The first hour especially is absolutely terrible. Like some student film maker tried to copy scorcese and put every cliche of gangster movies in there.And why is everyone completely ignoring tha godawful CGI/fake faces? The lips and movement was so off that it distracted me the entire time. The uncanny valley was so obvious it hurt my eyes. They even gave them plastic, cgi ears lol. De Niro walks around with a VERY obvious senior body, he cant even stand straight with his arched back etc. So when he pretends to be a young gangster it just looks so weird. The way he walks. The way his face is placed on his head, it sorta looks like a badly photoshopped bobble head...I don't even know how old he was supposed to be early on. Even with the terrible CGI he looked at least 60/70.. just with a plastic face. It was so damn confusing and annoying. Not to mention his obviously senior arms/body etc. I know the story, I know Sheerans age and Hoffa etc but in the movie I was always and constantly confused about their age etcThen there was the incredibly distracting music constantly. It almost always felt out of place and was so loud it distracted from the conversation going on. This was especially a problem early on during the young de niro scenes. Later on they tone down the loud background musicThen the story, after the first hour it felt like the movie was finally picking off. We got a lot less cgi and more of the story. But then absolutely nothing happens. This is one of the most interesting mobster / union stories out there and they managed to make it boring and eventless.Everyone seems to love de Niros character Sheeran which makes zero sense to me at all. Pesci (Bufalino) sees him working on a truck and is immediately interested in becoming his friend and helping him. Why would a made man decide this random truck driver is so special? For the rest of the movie Pescis character covers for De Niro with everything and starts to act like de niros older brother. A big change from his usual role as the loveable psycho. Even calls de Niro his son this one time. But I have no idea what the age difference is supposed to be between the two. Aside from starting to ""paint houses"", which he does later on, there is no reason for De Niro to be so well respected and loved by everyone. They never show why he is so popular..Pacino did some of the best acting in the show. But even with him they could have used another actor for HoffaListen I love it when a movie is long. Give me a movie that's 4 to 6 hours I still won't complain, the longer the better to me. But with this movie, I don't understand what happened to the time. They have 3 and a half hours to tell this story and they spend 20 minutes max with the actual story of Hoffa, the rest was just empty filler.After what happens to Hoffa (I mean is that even spoilable?) There is an full half hour of absolutely nothing. We have de Niro acting all sad about his daughter refusing to talk to him. It's never made clear why she hates him so much. Ok so she reads about dad in the papers, kids don't care about that. They dont fear their parents because others say so. They hate their parents because of how their parents are. But the film shows us none of that despite really focusing on that relationship extensively.I wish they had picked another actor for De Niros role. He is too old. The cgi was extremely distracting and left a very bad taste in my mouth for the rest of the movie. Even the way ""young"" de niro walked drove me crazy.. his young scenes annoyed me so damn much. It was never clear how old he was and he always looked very old so it was very jarring that they were suddenly in the past, then the future then the past again etc. CGI De Niro not only looks plastic, he looks like a hunchback trying to walk straight. Like someone put a coat hanger on the back of his jacket and there is a crane raising him from the ground to make him appear to stand straight.In the end this movie is one of the biggest disappointments ever to me. They took the most fascinating story and made it boring and nonsensical. I can't believe they took a story this great, used all the best actors and had the best mafia movie filmmaker and still turned it into such a massive mess.Truly a shame. And the critics and others reviewing it so highly makes me question the legitimacy of many of the reviews here. I get the critics being pretentious. But the audience isn't swayed as easily usually. Maybe they're all in some sort of collective denial.In the end you have a decent movie with terrible CGI, some great acting and some acting ruined by CGI, super old men pretending to be youngsters, a decent story that we barely get to see. An anti climactic ending. This could have been the movie of the decade. Instead it's a forgettable flick with tons of major names attached to it. A decade from.now people will still be talking about goodfellas but I doubt anyone will talk about this movie..The only way they can save this movie and make it watchable in the future is to fix the disgustingly bad CGI and tone down the annoying music. If they have some scenes flushing out the relationship between Frank Sheeran (de niro) his daughter, Bufalino (pesci) and Hoffa (pacino) that would give a lot.more perspective. From watching the movie there is nothing that explains why both Bufalino and Hoffa are so enamoured by this Irish hitman. I am not sure but I guess sheeran played a big role on the story, which might explain why everyone loves him and respects him so much. Why his daughter hates him for no good reason other than his life as a hitman (if his daughter hates him in real life I imagine he did a lot more to his family than just being a hitman for a job). I mean, at one point Hoffa is calling his people all kinds of names, while yelling etc. Then Sheeran/pacino is offended and walks out, only for Hoffa to run after him to tell him how much he loves him and how he wasn't talking to him, how he would never disrespect him like that. In another scene there is this guy who is introducing Sheeran to Hoffa and the guy is like ""omg, this Sheeran guy is the best, a natural leader, everyone loves him, I'd let him.have my wife if he wanted!!"".It also needed more plot. a bit of drama. It needed for things to happen not just the murder of one or two random people that we saw for 2 minutes on screen.Anyway I can rant on for hours..I was so excited for this. I guess the hype and expectations made the disappointment a lot worse."
109," I felt as if I've already seen it a million times before! Pure lack of originality!
","Scorsese knows his art, that's for sure, but maybe he shouldn't do any mafia films anymore. I mean, the Irishman had nothing original. Through-out the film it constantly reminded me of other mafia movies again and again. I wasn't surprised by anything and to be honest I stopped it half-way, because I was bored. I mean, I already knew its characters from other mafia movies, and I already knew what would happen next. Skip it if you have already watched many mafia films."
110," Nowhere near Goodfellas...
","Despite the cast, this is a boring, monotonous, long-winded diatribe about not much at all. The only reason I gave it three stars is out of pity.One of my all-time favorite movies is Goodfellas. This is the opposite of that movie. It starts out poorly and ends poorly, with the middle part lacking. I see why only Netflix would finance this, because studios knew it would do terribly at the box office.I would write about specific parts to better illustrate my point, but it is not memorable. The whole time I watched it thinking it MUST get better at some point, but it did not.There is also the whole concept that Sheeran has no evidence or anyone else's word to back up anything he says, so his story is much disputed. A long movie that is not entertaining and also not true seems to be a bad mix.There is another Hoffa story that has at least a few people who are saying the same thing about who killed him."
111," Colossal waste of time
","The movie is sooooo boring it's unbelievable.Comple garbage that could have been conceived only because of flashy ""classic"" names. Anyone else would have pushed this idea and he gets laughed out of Holywood.What a total unbelievable crap."
112," Boring, long, talking and more talking
",Don't waste 3.5 hours of your life watching this boring movie. It could have been 2 hours shorter and it would still be boring.
113," Did not finish
",I just couldn't finish this. I gave it multiple chances but after 1.3h I finally gave up. It was just not meant for me.
114," Not believable
","I guess the Hollywood people are so used to seeing 80 y/os with dyed dark hair and lots of plastic surgery, but us little people in Flyover country aren't
It's kinda pathetic seeing an old DeNiro beating up a guy and acting the tough guy. The energy from all of the actors isn't there. It doesn't work at all for me."
115," Getting dropped off at Grandma's for the week!
","This was a boring film, everything was dull, dialogue,music,timing etc.
All these 10 reviews must be from people who worked on the film ,how you can stay awake for the whole film then rate it 10/10 is fake. What a waste of talent time and money, wear an adult diaper while watching because you will be bored ."
116," Nostalgia boredom
","Netflix is an appropriate screening point for this hugely over-hyped/ over praised ' epic'. Reading through the ' masterpiece' comments,the glowing 9/10 reviews ,I can't quite believe they are for the same movie I just wearily sat through.
Honestly, it's tedious,boring in most parts; it never convinces- they are all old men pretending to being young men; the de- aging process used is at times ludicrous( results of glowing faces that look so unreal)dialogue is,at times,silly- ""hey kid"" a character calls out to an aged DeNiro hunched over his truck.....really???
The ' star' actors repeat performances we have seen many times before- this movie does not restore their 'now low' reputations.
Overall;the die- hard /gangster/ mob fans will probably revel in the nostalgia provided here..... unfortunately it will be nominated for undeserved awards...."
117," So bad on so many levels
","This is a movie that didn't need to be made. The best explanation for this movie is that it was like an Alzheimers ward put on a reenactment of Casino or something. All of the characters/actors are slow to get the lines out. The lines are very choppy. Kinda like they only did one take, no more. Having DeNiro act like a""young"" person was terrible. His cautious body moments and hand trembles gave him away. Not to mention the fact that the de-aging process only seemed to take them from 85 to 65. Apparently the technology is still not powerful enough.The plot and the scenes were not interesting in any way. Don't have any reason to root for any of the characters. I stopped halfway through. Just couldn't take any more.If you see any score higher than 6, it is not a real score. This film has no business being rated anywhere near as high as it is. Just awful."
118," Not much works here. Big miss.
","The 10 star ratings and gushing reviews are a joke. They cannot be serious; they are not credible. The blind loyalty is hard to fathom.The script itself is boring. A snoozer. Time creeps by so slowly that you not only look at your watch, you shake it too to make sure its still working.JUST BECAUSE THIS TEAM MADE GOOD FILMS IN THE PAST DOESN'T AUTOMATICALLY MAKE THIS A GOOD FILM.Yeah, Pacino, Pesci, DeNiro, Scorsese -- a legendary combo. No one denies this. But this film is garbage: Scenes that don't advance the plot. Half-hearted acting. Drab dialogue. Thought experiment -- replace the main actors with unknowns. What would you give this title then? 10 stars? Best film of the decade? A masterpiece? Lol! This wouldn't make it out of 2 star range.And here's the thing: Aside from Pesci (who holds this film together with an amazing turn) the acting is average. That's a fact. And a fact that is noted in other reviews here grounded in reality.And the absolute worst thing about this film-- as noted in other reviews -- is that the de-aging simply does not work. IT. DOES. NOT. WORK. AT ALL! This leads to bizarre, jolting scenes that rip you out of the story and have you looking at people around you like ""WTF???"".The grocer scene comes to mind. A 100 year old DeNiro, de-aged to (something? Its hard to tell, he looks like a Sleestack from Land of the Lost) beating up on a grocer that outweighs him by a 100 pounds is comical and strange to behold. DeNiro hits about as hard as a 2 year old boy fighting for his favorite dinosaur. Scorsese would have done better to have young DeNiro TOTALLY rendered in CGI like the Hulk. Seriously.Get a grip in reality 10 star people."
119," Tedious and empty
","I love many Scorsese films, but...The Irishman is an overly long nostalgia piece: the gangsters are ruthless; the women are mere bystanders and funeral attendees (why hire Anna Paquin just to glower?); the make-up and computer manipulated faces are distracting. Seeing Pesci, Pacino and DeNiro together again is enjoyable for a while, but the film just feels soulless and empty to me. No ideas, no message--just a fraternal reunion of some acting pals. Not satisfying."
120," Slow paced, boring, De Niro too old for role
","While Scorcese is a great director, he fails in the Irishman. Terribly slow paced, ridiculous flashback scenes of De Niro and Pesci as young men that is utterly unconvincing. These are old men trying to appear you g and cannot pull it off. In one scene De Niro beats up a grocer and he is supposed to be the father of his 13 year old daughter. It's ridiculous. He looks like a 76 year old man shuffling and trying to hurt the grocer. This is sad. The plot line is fine but should have been condensed into 2 hrs."
121," Boring and Dull
","I think De Niro made a fool of himself. He is a shadow of his former self. He is now fat and calcified.I started this movie with great expectation but my enthusiasm it soon wore thin, 10 minutes into the movie. I fast forwarded to see something interesting, but there was none, so I gave up. A waste of time.Long boring conversations, disjointed plot and old sluggish ex-stars."
122," The last mafia film for Scorsese.
","The Irish man is finally released and I'm glad it's on Netflix. All the hype, anticipation to watch his movie is a bust, from start to finish. It's boring to watch, slow as hell and a waste of my Saturday afternoon. What happen to this screenplay it got lost in translation? The Characters are not fully developed, all you see is a close caption of their demise. Al Pacino as Jimmy Hoffa didn't capture the essence and the tenacity of Hoffa. His Portrayal was mediocre. Jack Nicholson did a better job in portraying Hoffa. Joe Pesci as Russel Bufalino is reserved and calculating. Robert De Niro as Frank Sheeran is electrifying. I was waiting for something exciting to happen throughout the course of this 3hr and 29mins and it never materialize. IWhen you watch The Godfather it's a masterpiece that can be watched over, and over again on any of the cable channels. As for the Irishman, don't Believe the hype make your own conclusion and decide for yourself."
123," It would've been a good movie with a younger cast
",The cast is too old and it spoils the whole thing. It's not just De Niro and Pacino everyone in this film is old. Even the milkman. I guys they did it to make the protagonists fit in but it makes the whole thing look eerie. It's like your watching a parody or something. You're seeing De Niro play with his daughter and you can't but thing that he's too old to be starting a family. You see some people song doing some job and you think how old are they?I don't have anything against old people they have a place in movies playing old people but you can't have an 80 year old playing Jimi Hofa's bodyguard or some kid who just got into the mafia. It looks uncanny and it takes you out of the movie.
124," Painful
",Super slow and downright boring.worst Scorsese film ever.
125," Bored rigid
","I'm sorry to go against the grain but it's all been done before...not only that it's been done better. I tried 3 times to watch it but just got incredibly bored....don't understand how the heck he spent $159 million making it, really can't see where that money was spent."
126," Overhyped and too long
","Like a faded memory of Casino and Goodfellas, The Irishman covers the same ground in a similar vein (longer and slower) and doesn't add anything new. There are some entertaining exchanges and lines, some interesting scenes and moments, visuals and editing, but half-way through, the film becomes really boring and repetitive. If you've seen your Coppola and Scorsese mafia flicks before, you've seen it all. Yes, the CGI doesn't really work, but that's not even the main issue with the film. The exploration of loyalty, friendship, family, etc. has been done in so many of these films - I kept thinking about the scene between De Niro and Ray Liotta in the diner and Liotta's Voice Over in Goodfellas, which basically sums it all up. In the end I was utterly exhausted by the Irishman's overlong resolution and denouement, which again, didn't add anything new or noteworthy to the genre."
127," It could have been good
",The movie could have been great. But they used old old OLD actors and put makeup on them to try to make them look young. Doesn't work. Ever seen super old people fight? Check this out.. little weak baby kicks with dubbed over sound of someone slapping a turkey. What a joke.The story is decent. The actors are garbage.
128," No - my husband was watching his watch.
","It is simply a NY gangster film and Scorsese has certainly done better. Come on! Bob does not change his expression and the script throughout is unremarkable but did get a few laughs today. The two cast members I looked forward to have how many lines? Anna Paquin and - give me the name here - I'm sure you noticed him? Harvey anyone? Not the film producer but the man who was so beautiful with Anna in ""The Piano"".
Oh - and where was the music score I expected? A small musical reference to ""The Godfather""."
129," As a matter of fact, I'm really more than a little concerned for Scorcese.
","So Scorcese comes in with guns blazing: Marvel isn't cinema and he's the authority on what's cinema and not. Fellow mobster movie auteur Coppola weighs in, goes one step further: Marvel is vile. After such boisterous, vain comments, one expects that Scorcese has something big in his pocket. What he has however is a .38, it takes three and a half hour of shooting to bore the viewer to death.Now don't get me wrong, the movie isn't strictly bad on its own. But whatever it has comes from the big name actors, even if they play the roles they have already played at least a dozen times before this in much better movies. You have seen their better performances and in fact in, much better Scorcese mob movies. The latter half of the movie especially is a slog but I guess they thought ""it's Netflix, just put in all the film we shot without editing"". It drags on and on as if there's something in reserve to warrant the build up. It never comes.And mostly it's due to the anemic story: It's as if the scenario was written by a deep learning machine which was fed mobster movies, it's like a composite of those. Every scene you saw somewhere else before and definitely better, and towards the finale it's as generic as it goes. Even if it's an adaptation, Scorcese should have realized this story didn't need a movie, especially not one as long as Titanic.But here's the issue: He has been long sipping his bread in the wine of his Mobster Cinematic Universe, a continuous barrage of gangster movies that ended up repeating itself the most in this one. If he thinks this is his magnum opus, featuring his star-studded cast to the point that big names get like two-liner cameos, I'm concerned for him. As a matter of fact, I'm really more than a little concerned for Scorcese. It's what it is."
130," Waste of 209 minutes of your life
","It should be categorized as a shot at live action or a laughably photo-unrealistic computer-generated animation. Editing is not Scorsese quality, there are lots of continuity errors even in the simplest scenes.It was expected of the quality of the movie sector to dive head-bottom since these streaming platforms had to supply infinite amount of moving photos on the screens. But the indecency is the pay-for-good-reviews ""marketing.Oh, and I share his pain with Scorsese...in this day and age of nonsensical diversity in casting, there are no good-enough actors left at all in Hollywood so that he had to computer-generate real actors. Well played."
131," Boring
",It was so boring my partner and I fell a sleep during the movie.
132," I just wanted it to be over!
","After persuading my wife to watch this movie that I couldn't wait to watch, it turned out that she enjoyed it whereas I couldn't wait for it to end and put me out of my misery.Such a shame that the film missed the essential ingredient of being interesting.Massive disappointment (for me anyway!)"
133," Had to do it in installments
","Found this long, drawn out and really rather dull. I did it in 3 instalments as was getting bored. I really don't get the hype!"
134," Is Martin Scorsese surrounded by idiots?!
","How the hell did this get released. It wasn't a stumble it was a fall. The only redeemable parts: Ray Romano is awesome. Joe Pesci did the best acting of his life. He totally dimmed it down great performance. Al Pacino had the best line. You see a gun you charge him. You see a knife you run!
Robert Deniro was so miscast I couldn't even get my bearings. When I realized that they were attempting to make him not only Irish but also young I was shaking my head. I was shaking my head the whole time. Whoever let Martin release this should be ashamed. It's as bad as releasing a video of your best friend drunk as hell and making a fool of themselves. Absolutely terrible movie. The best part was figuring out who the actors and actresses were and what we've seen them in. Feel totally scared for Anna paquins career. The Affair three episode road to nowhere followed up by this? Wtf? Being in a Scorcese movie used to be something. Not after this disaster. If he goes out on this over three year project ugh....sad. And please for the love of God Stop playing In the still of the night and all worn out crappy 50s songs."
135," Stardust reunion
","This movie felt like watching an exibition basketball game with all the stars of the past that we grew up and loved watching. It is like putting on the court MJ, Magic, Bird, Jabbar and give them a ball to play. The stardust will still be there but everything will be slow, immobile and boring. Nobody can still dunk the ball and it will take for ever to run up and down the court. Although art is not sports and not depented on mobility and physical skills, it is obvious that this cast and director looked simply tired and worn out to carry the task. The movie lacked the flare of Martin's previous masterpieces and gave the impression that it was just a reunion of old friends. One more thing, please don't ever use this CGI-make-me-young-again technology. It looks ridiculous. The scene outside the grocery store is just too sad to watch."
136," Overrated.
","I've never been a fan of Scorsese, but that is a personal thing. I watched it on Netflix but found out it was playing locally and ended today, the same day i watched it. The CGI was hit and miss but was horrible on Pacino. Scorsese has criticized Marvel movies for not being ""art"" but by using CGI in this movie that was off putting it makes him a hypocrite as other people have mentioned on here. It's too long and, as has also been mentioned on here, the 3 leads are all in their 70s. So, while they may look younger they don't move like younger men. They move like 70 year olds. It makes it completely unbelievable. It would have been simpler to cast younger actors. Professional critics are fawning over it but then they are all a joke and i lost respect for them years ago. Pesci is surprisingly understated but Pacino and DeNiro are basically doing the same thing they have been doing for the past 2 decades. Glad i saw it on Netflix."
137," Masterpiece! Pacino alone is worth the price of admission!
","If you love Scorsese films you'll absolutely love this one. Pacino's performance is just beyond perfect. Don't listen to the nimrods that are calling this boring, 3.5 hours zoomed by when I saw it.Do yourself a favor and see this on the big screen if you have the chance."
138," Huge Disappointment
","I love Martin Scorsese movies but The Irishman is a super boring movie that never ended. Three and a half hours long and flat, just old man pretending to be young and aimlessly conversing. Robert De Niro's acting was awful the same face expression for 3.5 hours. I would have stopped watching this movie but because it was Scorsese movie wanted to finish it, we had to take 2 long breaks. I wonder who wrote those raving reviews, there were many people that worked on that movie."
139," boring and too long
",I dont really get what everybody likes about this movie. More than three hours of old man talking about gangster thing's plus some murders. That's it.
140," Boring and disappointing
",This movie has an outstanding cast..But in my opinion this movie was very boring..Alot more stuff could have happened..Waste of opportunities.
141," Old people getting older
","This is the story of a man who is supposedly young at the beginning of the film to when he's an old man. Robert de Nero, 75 plays him at all ages. He never looks younger than around 45 this is very distracting, to the point where is broke the vibe of the film. He walks like an old man and the scene at the butchers is laughable!The editing is far from flawless and the story delivery is very confusing at times.The film is long, like super long, not particularly original and overall probably the worst Scorsese film I've seen."
142," Good acting ruined by revisionist history in a fantasy of what mob men were like
","Robert De Niro is my favorite actor, and as usual he does a good job. Unfortunately it's the writing that falls short.
The movie jumps around in time, but much of it is set in the 1950s, and the high quality filming shows few, if any, anachronisms as far as the cars, settings, clothing or designs. Showing De Niro at different ages also didn't bother me much, except he looked like a very stiff 60 year old. The sets may say 1952, but the script writing screams 2019. It's a shame because with the money spent they could have made a great film with an accurate portrayal of life and people at the time. Instead they show PC revisionist history of the worst kind, and miss a tremendous opportunity to make an accurate historical piece.
The scene that totally lost me was one in which Dinero learns that his daughter was shoved by a grocer. She is sulking when he arrives home, and when he asks his wife what is wrong with the kid she tells him the guy shoved her. His daughter doesn't say much, but does nod her head when asked if it's true. She doesn't have a scratch on her.
In the next scene, Dinero returns to the market with his daughter by the hand, and beats the grocer to a pulp. He kicks him in the face and gives his hand a crush injury. . He severely injures and humiliates the man , kicking him into the street , beating the man like an animal without asking a single question..
The movie is set at a time when the power dynamic between adults and kids was completely different. In the 1950s De Niro would have more likely whipped his daughter for annoying the adult if he heard about it,
Let me tell you what life was REALLY like in that era for kids:
In the early 1960s when I was 6 years old, I was allowed to walk alone to the ""liquor store"" on the corner to buy candy. When in the store, I saw a girl my age telling her cowboy grandfather she wanted candy for the kids back home, and he insisted ""no, they get ice cream, they will throw candy all over the yard"". She was crying when they left the store.
When I went out front a few minutes later, she was screaming her head off , and her cowboy grandfather had whipped her with a belt , which was still doubled in his hand. I knew what that was like, nearly all kids of that era did, including, probably especially, the kids of mob guys. I felt bad, embarassed for her, for me, I even paradoxically felt guilt.
THIS was he REAL 50s, THE ""GREATEST GENERATION"". Scorsese is old enough to know it, he should show it to us, least we forget it. To see portrayal of his ""hit man"" as a 2019 Dad is absurd , instead of what most ""Dads"" were like at that time. It's revisionist history of the worst type. Younger people have no idea, and many adults don't remember, or more accurately chose not to. Other anachronisms include the daughter refusing to thank her dad's friend for a money gift, and willful disobediance didn't occur much back then. Also, grown men didn't wear pajamas, in the 1960s I only saw that on TV.
I heard a crimes division guy in a documentary complain that Hollywood's portrayal of these mob guys as caring family men is ridiculous. They were sociopathic killers and generally made bad husbands and fathers. To show anybody , especially a mob guy , vigilante splat a man without knowing what happened in that era is bad history and bad for society. If we don't remember our history, we will repeat something worse."
143," Fantasies of a Wannabe Hit-man
","Based on the rest home recollections of a geriatric former gangster, 'The Irishman' adds another long-winded chapter to Scorcese's collection of mob potboilers. As far as authenticity is concerned, Frank Sheeran was renowned for being a liar and drunk - and neither his former associates nor FBI investigators believed his boasts of being a mob hit-man. Instead they remember him as a minor thug who would never have been entrusted with serious matters like the claimed killing of his pal Jimmy Hoffa. In the film's far-fetched version of this notorious crime, Hoffa's son observed Sheeran as the last person in his father's company, but somehow this goon never appeared on the FBI's radar as a suspect.An elderly De Niro is unconvincingly rendered into youthful middle age by CGI, as Scorcese trudges through Sheeran's catalogue of imaginary murders with the energy of an accountant filling out a tax return. The actor pastes a stone-faced 'tough guy' expression on his face as his crime boss (Joe Pesci) instructs him to eliminate rats and rivals in obscure code phrases such as ""painting houses"". This jargon was also invented by Sheeran in order to make him look like an insider, although the Gotti tapes revealed genuine mobsters use simpler terminology like: ""Whack the bum"".The film's final act depicts Sheeran in an elder care facility, revealing the retired hoodlum as an empty husk, devoid of empathy or insight. 'The Irishman' is just as formulaic as the superhero schlock Scorcese has recently criticized, but the Oscar babble is already deafening. The only question raised by this tired movie is why a veteran film-maker remains fascinated by the violence, cowardice and greed of these dismal lowlifes."
144," I Heard You Paint Houses (2019)
","The Irishman, the highly anticipated film from Martin Scorsese which reunites actors Joe Pesci, Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino for the first time in decades, in this adaptation of the book I Heard You Paint Houses which recounts the final days of Jimmy Hoffas life and the connection Frank ""The Irishman"" Sheeran had to Hoffas disappearance.There are at least two moments in the film where Robert Deniro's charcter Frank ""The Irishman"" Sheeran mentions how young people of today dont know much about Jimmy Hoffa other than the fact that he dissapeared. And I am definitely in that category and that is how I will be approaching this review.The name Jimmy Hoffa was etched into popular culture as being a notable figure who went missing. I have not done any research on the topic, nor watched or remember previous films on the subject of Jimmy Hoffa, so this story was able to shed some light on Hoffa, who was the head of the Teamsters, and how he was basically the most important figure of the American worker next to the President.The story is told through 3 different timelines. The film begins with an elderly Sheeran telling the audience his story, which then shifts to the present with DeNiro and Pesci on a road trip to Detroit. During their roadtrip, Sheeran recollects the first time he met Bufalino and then shifts to the past to when he began his life of crime.Like other gangster films of the past there are many players and characters to come and go as the film progresses. These films are telling stories that span decades, so even if the viewer is confused or not really know what is going on, you can view it and compare it to gangster films of the past.And in that regard. I feel The Irishman just cant compare to other films that were told better. Goodfellas, Casino, The Godfather Alot of the times while watching this I felt I had already seen it before. Which is how some people feel about Casino being another version of Goodfellas.And I guess I was expecting something as epic as those films, but nothing ever comes close.My opinion may be unpopular, but wait for Netflix. And hearing the hefty pricetag on this film, I just couldn't see it on the screen. It really didnt feel cinematic at all. When I went home I had to do a double feature of Goodfellas and Casino just to remind myself that Gangster movies can be a plethora of things: exciting funny and sad. The Irishman is mostly a slog and in time wont be remembered like other classics."
145," This was just forgettable
","This was just a sad chance on an inflated budget. I've seen better with less. The actors were decent, the story lacking. Netflix should be ashamed of this expression for a possibility of more without a screen..."
146," No way is this a good movie.
","My wife just went to bed and said it was three and a half hours of boredom. I can watch movies like the Godfather and Goodfellas over and over. I would never watch this again.The actors are too old for the roles given. The whole movie movie is trying to capture magic that you cant buy from throwing money at it.
Really disappointing."
147," Unwatchable bad choice of actors
","Im sure the storyline and movie would be great if i could get over how old Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci look as "" young"" men. When de Niro is in action being ""dangerous"" he looks like he is just on a stroll from the Old persons home. kicking the crap out of the Store man?? more like trying to not fall over and keep his balance... terrible. referring to each other as kid what a joke.The lack of destinction of age makes it hard to keep track of when in the timeline they are supposed to be and i just dont understand how old they are supposed to be? fathering a new child at the age of 55? or is he supposed to be 30?Dont understand why they didn't use young actors for the younger versions of themselves. or at least CGI the hell out of them. would have had alot of potential if they had!"
148," No,this didn't work.Supercast in 1998 for this genre Let these actors CLOCK OUT.
","Was this the version of the EXPENDABLES FOR OLD MOB ACTORS ? I read such great reviews about this movie.But when I started to watch the first 25 minutes I new this was just a bunch of old rich Talented actors trying to break a hip bone for the fans because they don't need the fame or money. ANY one of these guys could carry this film 22 years ago But today all I smelled was bengay being slathered all over the screen.It hurts me to say this about such a group that has given the film Industry and fans so,so,much.At Least when stallone and arnold do this kind of film its tongue and cheek and not a serious misadventure LOVE THE CAST BUT they are not believable gangsters in 2019. not as leads but as older wiser ElCapo's or Dons."
149," Boring as hell
","Looking at all the big names, expectations where high. Long story short (like they should have done with this movie), it was boring as hell. I could have better spend my time on plucking hairs from my legs than on this movie. Would have been more exciting! Whoever rates this a 10 must be either paid to do so, or must have been desperately searching for a way to fall asleep..."
150," Too many anachronisms--cars, songs, all wrong
","For such a meticulous filmmaker Scorsese did not pay enough attention to these details. (Like the ridiculous scene where Joe Pesci pulls out spark plugs with his hands --no wrench--and says' they're ok. And the timing chain--utterly and truly ridiculous to think you could tighten a nut and it would continue running.) But I digress. The idea that a brand new Hudson (a car that had its heyday in the 1940s; out of business by 1954) would be running the streets all shiny and new in the late 50's --given that most of the other cars in the film are the ""forward look"" cars introduced by Chrysler in 1957 is silly.I truly despise the romance of the Mafia. But Scorsese has the deepest love for them and this is his attempt at monumentalizing them."
151," Torturously long
","Why do you get someone with a thick Italian accent to play an Irishman?So this movie is literally a whose who of Italian actors, with one off the all-time great Hollywood directors and producers, however it still manages to be underwhelming. Watching it felt like death by a thousand cuts and is a disgrace to The Godfather and Goodfellas."
152," Boring and long
",Had hard time watching this film. Was expecting something interesting. 3+ hours about nothing. Either there are paid reviews out there or people don't know what they are talking about. Mediocre movie at best.
153," .........only because there isn't an option for NO stars.""
","Total garbage, start to finish.
Another ""EYE killed Jimmy Hoffa"" story. There are at least four books out there, one is the ""The Iceman"" (THIS book was called ""I Hear You Paint Houses"") and a few others, where they ALL claimed to have killed Hoffa, and disposed of his body in either Detroit, suburban Detroit, New Jersey, you-name-it.Movie is longer than Gone With the Wind (Or did it just seem that way?), we learn nothing new about Hoffa; Pacino was horribly miscast and unbelievable as Hoffa himself,, DeNiro is as rotten in this movie as he is in real life, rest of movie is a bunch of cast offs and has-beens (Though I liked Joe Pesci- even though he was trying to portray a man about half his real life age.)Right up there with laughable JFK conspiracy movie as fiction masquerading as fact.Save your money and/or your time.One more thing; will.....this.....movie.....ever.....end? Zzzzzzzzzzz...."
154," The GeriatricIrishman
","What is everybody on about ? The CGI geriatrics acting tough is just cringy, the dialogue puts you to sleep, it's a pointless movie that should have never been made in the first place. Three and a half hours of boring nothingness. Waste of money."
155," DO NOT waste your time on this movie!
","How do I begin? This movie stinks. It was boring. The repetitious dialogue and the length of the scenes were snoozers in my book. Not the best for Martin, Al, Joe and Robert. By the end of the movie I wanted to shoot all the characters myself. Very disappointed."
156," Seen it all before
","This dragged on for seven centuries and covers material Scorsese has done so much better so many times before. Also, very reminiscent of DeVito's Hoffa movie with Jack Nicholson who was much better than anything in this new film and The Irishman is so dull it makes Hoffa look like a classic. The digital de-ageing was just weird and the actors here were on autopilot"
157," Snoozefest
",If you have insomnia this is the perfect movie for you. You will be asleep within 30 minutes.

A known person shoots people in full restaurants but nobody recognises him.
Hours of boring pointless conversation
Many useless characters, looks like a lot of actors needed money"
159," Not the classic it should be
","So let's be clear, this film has an amazing cast, some brilliant acting and amazing scenes and it should've been a fantastic two and a half hour film.However, there's an hour of unnecessary padding that makes it drag and the last half is a bit boring. Characters seem to be introduced for the sake of it without any real relevance to the main storyline which gives it a disjointed feel.This doesn't compare to Goodfellas or the Godfather films and I can think of a dozen ""gangster films"" I'd watch again over The Irishman."
160," Boring, Slow & 3hrs 30mins is Too Long
","Poor Writing,
Poor De-Aging CGI,
Stephen Graham's (british) American accent is poor in this (good accent in Boardwalk Empire)De-Niro Has No Irish Accent & is supposed to be a Young Man & looks 40-50,There has Been Rumours JFK Had ties to the Mob However its more likely he was Killed for his leaks of Alien UFO Information.Also They Use Real Life JFK Footage, Yet have an actor & don't re create the iconic footage with that actor."
161," Not his best...actually pretty lame.
","Not very good...Pacino as Hoffa is a joke...isn't Jack Nicholson still alive...he would have been great in that part.

165," Soo long and boring. Slow
","Waste of life watching this. It's a joke. It has to be. How can anyone like this movie? Robert DeNiro's ""young self"" looked old and creepy too. I'm sure it's hard to carry yourself like a young person at an old age but still. Slow storyline"

167," Terrible, just awful.
","Not sure what they were trying to achieve with this turkey, but I've never seen such a terrible script, wooden acting and CGI give such incredibly comic results.
A bit of The Emperors New Clothes at play here."
168," Joe Pesci is back with a bang.
",Joe Pesci delivers a powerhouse performance as Russel in a movie crowded with great performers and performances. Not a dull moment in this classic Scorsese film where we see all the usual suspects one finds in his movies. Robert Deniro delivers yet another flawless performance . Jesse plemons does not fail us either. The turning back time software used on the faces of the actors is good but you can't software back the body of a 70 year old and it shows. It's a minor flaw but the actors more than make up with their acting.
169," Great Film
","""The Irishman"" is really a great film. When the viewer watches a movie with 3h 29min running time and does not stop or take a nap it is an indication that the film is attractive and holds the attention. The screenplay is excellent, disclosing in flashbacks the life of the gangster Frank Sheeran performed by Robert De Niro. Martin Scorsese is certainly one of the best directors of Mafia films. The cast with the veteran Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, Joe Pesci and Harvey Keitel is the indication of maybe the best in the genre in the contemporary world. The effects in the make-up are amazing and it is hard to know who they are in the present days. In the end, ""The Irishman"" is certainly one of the best (if not the best) production by Netflix. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""O Irlandês"" (""The Irishman"")"
170," Don't watch!
","Absolutely crap... Awful scene where a ""young"" DeNiro"" nerds to beat up a store owner but kicks and misses him a few times should have sent off warnings... This is a good story... Really badly told!... Almost 4hrs of my life wasted!"
171," This is just really baaaad!
","I can't believe how long and bad this movie is. The CGI is really miserable, and I'm just really tired of the same old story line. Give it up guys, the nursing home is calling!"
172," Horrifically Enthralling
","This movie was a different animal then Scorsese's other gangster films. Something about it was disturbing that after viewing I still can't quite put my finger on. It's hard and not really fair to compare Irishman right away to Goodfellas and Casino, which I've seen a hundred times each. I will say that after subsequent viewings, that even if I don't like it better then those two films, the Irishman is better then The Departed, Mean Streets, and Gangs of New York imo.During the Wolf of Wall Street (which I don't count as a real gangster film as great as it was), I kept checking my watch because I was having such a good time I didn't want it to end. The Irishman took on a different form of enjoyment where I never once looked at the time because I was so absorbed with what I was watching. The first hour reminded me of Goodfellas, the second hour kind of reminded me of Gangs of New York because of Scorsese giving us another history lesson about America's underbelly, and the last part of the film reminded me a bit of Casino with an undertone that felt to me like a horror movie. Even though we know what's coming to Hoffa, it doesn't make it any less disturbing to watch when we see it.I never watched any of Scorsese's religious movies like Silence so I can't give an opinion about comparing the ending of the Irishman to the tone of those films. I'll just say I felt like I was attending a bittersweet funeral at the end.Enough has already been said about how great the actors were so I'll just end my review by stating that Stephan Graham was another standout besides the other three main stars. He more then held his own and brought an eclectic, elictrifying mix of comedy and toughness to the story. An excellent villain in a movie full of bad guys.I hope others enjoy the movie as much as I had. It was great for nostagilia to see these powerful movers and shakers, from my grandfather's WWII era, brought to life."
173," A massive failure.
","I've seen Scorsese's classic: The Departed, Goodfellas, Casino, Wolf of Wall Street, Ragin Bull, Taxi Driver, etc. This movie 'The Irishman' isn't in the same league as the his other movies, it's not even the same sport.Some may think a rating of one star is harsh but given the director, the actors, the massive budget, this is hugely underwhelming. A massive failure to deliver on the hype.The movie started off as a story about a hitman played by Robert De Niro. I think the main character was suppose to be a very interesting person but for me he wasn't. Al Pacino's character (Jimmy Hoffa) comes in to the movie about an hour in and I was more interested in his story than anything else. After Hoffa's inevitable disappearance there's another hour of old men shuffling about in prison, picking out caskets, where they are going to get buried, etc. It turned in to a snoozefest.The CGI was hyped up about how these guys were made to look younger and older. It was suppose to be amazing - It's not. It's jarring as hell. There's this strange blue eye effect going on that I couldn't quite understand. Despite changes to their faces they still move around like geriatrics. There's one scene De Niro is beating someone up and it's hilarious because he can barely stamp on the guys hand properly. Keep in mind De Niro is in his mid 70s and it shows in the body language. They should've used younger actors.When the end credit came up I was like 'what the fudge?! That's it?!' This was just a truly forgettable experience. I will never watch this movie again."
174," Overrated!
","I still cannot finish this movie! Incredibly slow and drawn out!
Another overrated movie out of Hollywood.
So disappointed."
175," Scorsese Returns!
",I had the priv of watching this at a screening via BFI. I loved every moment of it. I'm not going to give any spoliers. It's good- what more do you to need know?!
176," 3h29mins you will never get back
",It's as bad and boring as its long. Dude cant remember anything after 1990 and thats why he made this movie. Worst 3h29mins i ever spent on Netflix.
177," Gooffellas revisited
","This film is totally ludicrous , its another gangster movie using the same actors as goodfellas. Only problem is, there all old men now ludicrously trying to play young tough thugs. The movement by deniro is unbelievably funny, pity they didn't make it a comedy spoof film, it may have worked then."
178," Geriatric wanna-be mobster movie
","It's hard to make a convincing ""Mob Movie"" with geriatric actors. Watching De Niro trying to beat the crap out of a guy was one of the funniest things I've ever seen. Good plot, just felt like this movie was trying to be ""Goodfellas"". Plus De Niro is a liberal whack job and I can't take him seriously anymore......"
179," A Movie to Appreciate for Unappreciated Reasons
","In the past ten years, I have had to sit through some of the most average films that were garnering Oscar-attention to try to see what the fuss was all about. I would sit there with an open-mind trying to see, or extract, what exactly was so good about these ""hyped"" movies.Take just the last year or two for instance. As I peered hard into stuff like Roma, A Star is Born, or 3 Billboards, and similar stuff, it was like searching for a grain of sand in a field of tall grass to find what was so ""classic"" or special about them, compared to my four decades of watching and rewatching true greats and classics. By the time I got done, the best I could do was shrug and say, ""I guess"" (guess it was decent). But the truth was that none of these movies satisfied. The best you could say was that one or two scenes were good or that it was ""artistic"", but that doesn't mean much when there is no plot and it's just visual scenery.So the thing with the Irishman is it is understandable this movie will not be for people who don't like to sit through long movies at about 3 and a half hours long. So it will get it's fair share of casual movie-goer criticisms. However, when you really read these reviews, one thing almost all of them have in common is that they are very superficial. Nobody is arguing the merits of the actual true story, how good the acting was, or how good the director was. They are just stressing CGI effects of deaging, the actors are too old (I don't understand this one since Hoffa has been normally shown historically in photos to be at least in his 50s in most news coverage when telling his story, and that is fairly old), or that the movie is too long. Some are just dullards with short attention spans who even admit they only watched the first half hour or so and are trying to critique an epic story that unfolds, which is just dumb. So the criticisms are actually shallow and perfunctory.Now, here is the experience that I got. I went into it unbiased and with relatively low expectations. First off, the lengthy run time scared me a little, and I thought I may be in for a snoozer. But let me tell you right off the bat that within the first half hour I knew I was watching a vintage Scorcese movie due to the style, the editing, the music, and the top notch acting performances. That, first and foremost, got my attention, and then before I knew it an hour and twenty minutes had gone by and I had held in my need to use the bathroom, it was that compelling and riveting; I didn't want to miss one line or one scene because every single scene (and there were many with so many cuts and edits) was imperative to the story.Unlike in most of the years of the past decade, I truly felt like I was watching a true movie that I didn't need to squint at to try to extrapolate some level of quality that wasn't actually there to try to justify the warranting of critical acclaim and Oscar-buzz talk. It was unforced and naturally immersive, and this is something to really appreciate these days imo.To be naturally taken in by a good story with great acting, with surprise elements (such as the repeated inclusion of historical events like the JFK victory, the Bay of Pigs and Castro, how the mafia had casino investments in Cuba, Kennedy's assassination, Bobby Kennedy as Attorney General going after the mob despite the fact that the mob was one of the reasons why Kennedy won in the first place, and subsequently even the Nixon years) was a true pleasure each and every scene. While the glass-half-empty people can criticize the deaging CGI, nobody can argue for one minute that all 3 lead actors were at least good, and this is not to mention all of the solid supporting characters (I mean to have Harvey Keitel as like a secondary character in a movie like this is a luxury with his menacing glare and wise-guy presence).Best of all, this is all based on a true story so all of these people really existed, and I would be lying if I told you I didn't laugh several times throughout the film, including at the screen stoppage and captions that revealed when and how many of the side characters eventually died (which was usually something like ""1981, 8 shots to the head"" or ""1980 six gunshots to the back of the head""), or the conversation in the car that extends and Pacino asks Sally Bags what he knows about fish (""Have you ever even caught a fish?""). Being real people and based on true historical events is an incredibly understated asset of this film. Even the road movie aspect of it, how it is in the present day and they are driving through Pennsylvania and stopping for smoke breaks for Pesci's wife on their way to Ohio I found to be pleasingly realistic.For most of the movie, especially Pesci, it doesn't feel like the actors are acting at all. Sometimes DeNiro had some forced scenes, and Pacino always goes over the top at times, but overall the acting was just excellent.Even though I fell asleep at 5am about halfway through the movie on the first night it was released, which was already way past my usual sleep time, I still couldn't wait to finish it the next day. But I'll be honest, I thought it was going to get boring since it had slowed down in the middle a little bit. But later in the day I returned to pick up where I had left off and I was in for a big surprise as to the rest of it.Reminding me slightly of the Aviator, the ending of the movie goes into DeNiro's/Sheeran's later life and old age, as well as Pesci's. These scenes were all gold and well done, surprisingly, I truly appreciated the maturity and realism with which Scorcese constructed this portion of the movie and its scenes and themes. I don't understand some critics who saw this part as Scorcese himself as atoning for his violent movies at all, although that's a fine interpretation if that works and perhaps it has some truth to it. Instead, what I saw was the humanity of this gangster (gangsters including Pesci) being shown to the audience as he struggles with ailments and immobility. I'm not going to lie, but personally, I was immersed and saddened by this final half an hour.Sure this guy was a killing SOB, but in old age, I really felt bad for him. I'm not sure what exactly that means. It's not that there haven't been other movies or shows that didn't make you feel bad for the villain. But one thing it did mean is that Scorcese made this movie more soulful and emotional than it really needed to be, he ended it with that, and that will probably make it ultimately memorable in a unique way. Anyone who shut the movie off in the first 30 minutes or halfway through doesn't deserve to catch the final 30 minutes because they don't have the depth to access and appreciate such raw material and emotional truths about life anyway.I was just appreciative that I finally got to see a real movie about real people, who weren't overly glamourized as say in The Wolf of Wall Street, or as boringly evolved as in the Aviator. I got to see a truly good movie that easily deserves its Award-buzz without feeling like I was trying to find a piece of sand in a tall field of grass, and for that, I'm appreciative."

","One can only be amazed at how great Al Pacino, Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci are....there aren't enough words to describe how great these 3 people are., my only comment is Harvey Keitel who plays Angelo should have had more screen time but overall, well done NETFLIX for bringing these for the whole world to see.a much recommended film for sure!"
181," Great Movie If Made in 1990
","The Irishman is old stuff, told in the same old way, with the same old actors.
I expected something else. Not this.
It is slow. Now slow burns are a thing. But it should break new ground. Remember Eastern Promise. This didn't.
It's so long. Wonder how peeps will sit through it in cinema halls with no pee break.
Frankly, the movie reads like a page from Wikipedia. Straight-laced with no sense of humor. And if you may, it looks like The Sopranos but without the understated humor, raw power and great acting.
And what was Anna Paquin doing in the movie. She could have continued her invisible existence elsewhere.
Finally, if you give this movie a miss, no probs."
182," It's so boring
","All these raving reviews are bs, a group of big celebrities in a mafia movie with a really boring story telling, boring acting, bad makeup, no fancy wording here just to say this is a bs Scorsese movie, he trashes Marvel's movies while his is a total let down no entertainment no art."
183," Meh
",I've seen a lot worse but it was just to long with to little happening for long periods atleast over an hour to long. De Niro is still great but that doesn't carry the film for 3 and a half hours. Wanted it to be great but just couldn't get into it.
184," DISAPPOINTING OLD ACTORS
","The Irishman had much to offer but it was let down by the choice of actors. Their age was a problem, despite ""a custom three-camera rig and extensive digital de-aging visual effects (that) were used to make De Niro, Pacino, and Pesci appear younger in many of the film's flashbacks"". De Niro's age was particularly on display; he looked like a jittery old man not the young man who's daughter he was standing up for.This was less of an issue for Pacino and Pesci because their roles were different.Quite apart from age, I find it difficult now to watch a De Niro on film without seeing his foul-mouthed, disgusting anti-Trump rants. De Niro was once a great actor, but is it time to put him out to pasture?"
185," JESUS CHRIST! So sick of gangster movies
","Just another script written for DeNiro, Joe Pesci, and Al Pacino to go round the cemetery once again before they all die."
186," Absolute Disaster!
","No originality, no subtlety... No eloquence in the storytelling or in any of the lines.Not to mention the actors, as legendary as they may be, are totally worn out and definitely aren't fit for this kind of film anymore...In my opinion, the only thing that makes people think this film is successful is the nostalgia it evokes from the classics like Goodfellas or Godfather. Otherwise, it's empty, dull; a complete cinematic failure.3.5 hours of stealing people's attention and time, though that's what cinema is all about today right? In the world of Netflix? In the end, it's still fun to watch De Niro trying to act as if he is 40 years younger than he really is.Netflix sees that Al Pacino, De Niro and Joe Pesci together will surely attract many viewers and goes ""Hey, let's make a movie everyone's gonna watch! Who cares if it is totally banal and offers nothing to this genre... All it needs is a classic style, best actors from the last century and a simple story line any idiot can follow! Today's viewers aren't that discerning anyway, because we've been feeding them crappy productions with zero originality or creativity for quite some time now...""This shouldn't have been the way this genre went extinct, but there we are... Commercially speaking, good one tho, this probably will be the one we will all remember. Thank you Netflix..."
187," Im sad I watched it
","Should have used other actors to start with and it just drags on and on. It doesn't flow very well at all, like, they had some ideas for scenes, and the order they should go in.... but no real build up / tension / link between.And just randomly putting text up to tell us the person we only see in that one scene, for ten seconds, dies......????It's not his best film by far. Just watch Casino or Goodfellas again and pretend this never happened"
188," I'm stunned Martin Scorsese produced this mess...
","The film is filled with sloppy continuity errors, terrible special effects and haphazard audio dubbing. Joe Pesci's accent changes mid scene. I loved both him and Robert De Niro in Casino and Goodfellas, this is a far cry from those great films. Actors in the green screen car scenes are sawing on the wheel while driving in a straight line.
I don't know who came up with the ""timing chain cap"" line but they should be swiftly fired. There's no such thing as a timing chain cap on any engine whatsoever.
Jesse Plemons has the acting range of a wet paper towel, but a lot of the acting could be described as unexceptional so I guess it's on theme. I agree with the other reviews that it's slow and drawn out. 3/4 through the movie I thought this seemed like a Netflix cash grab with big name actors."

","Scorcese proved again that he is king of mobster type of films and irishman is another gem in his collection,i woudnt say that irishman is better then goodfellas or even departed but it very good quality fulled film with great performances and overall good story of life of frank sheeran,still i have some little nitpicks i felt that ray romano isnt for this type of films and paquin was little underused and that is it,if you love mobster films of you are fan of sheeran life do yourself favour and enjoyed it"
190," A below average Scorsese mafia remake of ""Forest Gump"".
","What a waste of talent and money! 3 and a half hours of Scorsese revisiting his old Mafia schtick. At least Joe Pesci got paid for this mediocre lump of footage. What a waste of Netflix budget . Nothing new, it ends up being a: ""A few old guys tell a story nobody cares to hear about , without any creativity, but with a big lump of the budget spent on the ""rejuvenation CGI"" . A total waste . Netflix, ""El Camino"" cost one 8th of the sum , but provided more entertainment value. Consider this."
191," Overlong, over-rated and predictable

","Yes, this movie was executed masterfully, with some scenes popping vividly onto the screen with it's realistic violence. However, this was supposed to be an immersive cinematic experience, but I found myself continuously looking at the time stamp on the bottom of the screen. It's run time could easily be cut down by an hour and it would still be too long. Scorsese is a genius director, but this movie wasn't his smartest..."
194," Spectacular definitely deserves some awards
",Martin Scorsese still at it with another masterpiece! Great acting throughout and soundtrack both of which keep me captivated! Impressive how Robert De Niro is such an exquisite actor at his mid 70's. I like how similar to other Scorsese films The Irishman has a lot of profanity. I highly recommend this movie it has all the essentials you'd want including lots of brutal violence and beautiful cinematography.
195," I really want to love it.
","But I just can't, the acting and cinematography was, well great as you would expect with this line up of actors and this director (although none of their best performances, nor his best direction). But my biggest gripe is the way that they each played their younger self's, the animation was shoddy and just not particularly immersive as you couldn't always tell where your were untill you realised what was going on. I wasn't expecting to be on the edge of my seat but a little bit of tension wouldn't go a miss. I also didn't feel any emotional attachment to any of the characters, not as fult of their acting but more the flaws of the script. Although at the end I did like the nod to leaving the door open."
196," All Too Familiar
","Feels like something I've seen many times already. When will this group of actors stop playing the same characters and the director stop making the same film? A decent movie, nothing more and not worth more than one viewing."
197," One of the best movie of the year
","This year wasn't one of the best for the cinema, but this one where Scorsese make a come back is the most realistic movie of Scorsese. Goodfellas and Casino were fabulous but more glamour, I think that the 3.5 hour runtime is totally justified because the movie follow several years of Mafia. Including, the rise and the fall of Jimmy Hoffa. Absolutely worth to watch."
198," Utterly bewildering
","Apart from everything else (absurd length, boring dialogue, phoned in acting, trite patronizing soundtrack, etc etc) WHY oh WHY did they go with this reverse aging CGI thing?? If you are going to take a risk like that, shouldn't you make sure it actually WORKS? Because it doesn't, and it completely distracts and confuses the viewer. From that perspective, I will say that I got a ton of laughs seeing De Niro's bizarre 'young' alien eyes in scene after scene. Ridiculous wigs and dye jobs on all the actors too. Pacino comes across like that loud senile guy in the nursing home who's always shouting incoherently. It's hard to believe that every one of these guys used to be so magnificent onscreen. Martin, please. Stop.The one good thing about this movie is that it has really alerted me to the utter corruption of all these professional critics as well as the review websites. Even the stars of this film cannot truly believe that it is good."
199," The most boring movie ever
",I think that's my first rating on IMDb but this movie is so boring that I had to. There is no action and most dialogs are people repeating their words a couple of times. Me and my wife watched it over a couple of days just to see if it gets better. It didn't.
200," Like listening to an old man tell an interesting story
","Watching The Irishman is, appropriately, a lot like listening to an old man tell a story. It drags on a little too long and sometimes it loses focus about where it's heading, but it's interesting stuff. And after it's over, you're glad you listened to it. This movie feels like an epilogue for Martin Scorsese's work, featuring his favorite subject matter and actors. This film didn't blow me away, but it's still a well-made organized crime drama."
201," You can't get young again
","This was a good story and Robert DeNiro is one of the finest actors of all time.....But..for me, it was impossible to take the movie seriously in many parts when 70+ year old DeNiro was supposed to be a man in his 30s and 40s. Makeup artists routinely age young actors to look older but it just doesn't work the other way. Same goes for Pacino and others in the film. I'm sure I would have loved this moving if it was done in flashbacks with younger men playing the youthful parts in the movie. I just couldn't stop looking at the jet black shoe polished hair on DeNiro that was supposed to be enough to shave 35 years off his face and laugh. In my circle, people feel the same but clearly there's a much wider audience that easily overcame it based on the very high ratings."
202," Could not watch it till the end, too long, boring and overhyped
","The three lead characters are all near 80 and they are supposed to incorporate far younger guys. Nothing against old actors but this just felt not right. Why did not the director pick up a younger guy to play Frank when he started his career with the Mob? It worked in The Godfather....The scenes with Niro being a father to a young daughter and having a young wife while he looks like their grandfather in spite of the makeup and computer are cringeworthy. Are we supposed to buy the fact that this elderly character is an important muscle of the Mob ?
Al Pacino is a great actor and he is really trying, especially he is yelling round a lot as if he wants to show us how full of energy he is, but it just felt kind of wierd, him portraying a 50 something year old Hoffa for one simple reason: he is just a couple months shy of 80 and it shows, he even has a hunchback of some kind, which just cannot make him seem to be a 50 year old, the same problem with de Niro, who was not particularly good in this, just showing the same grimace over and over again until you tire of it,moreover, one has really study Wikipedia to know all these characters / mobsters, union leaders etc.../Pesci was actually the best of the three, a good, subdued acting. The movie has a very well done production / clothing and style of the era in the 50's and 60's wonderfully depicted, many scenes accompanied with music of that era, this is nice but still does not make me care...the screen time is horribly long, more than 3 hours, which is unbearable."
203," Over-hyped and over-rated
","I'm not sure what all the hype is about this movie, it felt about an hour too long on a story that's based on lots of false information and speculation. Wasting money and time on showing the actors as younger didn't work as their age still showed through especially in their movements - DeNiro kicking someone as a middle aged man looked very much like an old DeNiro kicking someone. I didn't feel any raw emotion throughout the entire 3+ hours even at the most important or meaningful parts of the movie. DeNiro was fine and his usual solid self but not sure what was so Oscar worthy about his performance. The movie itself to me at least became exactly what Franks daughter did the entire movie in being quiet without much emotion."
204," Overhyped TV movie
","We all appreciate that Scorsese is one of the greats but there's nothing new here. Its a well made film but its not special or groundbreaking in any way. It wouldn't have surprised me to see this as 3 part mini series on TV. Time it seems, has passed Scorsese' work by leaving it nuanced & slightly old hat & it feels as though Hollywood's old boys club are letting us know they're all still alive & well & able to kick it with young bucks. Yes there is still a place for this sort of thing but sadly that place will be a quiet dusty corner of history as this falls well short in terms of story & relevance. Of course film critics will lap it up & fawn over Scorsese' greatness but length of film does not equal great movie & Scorsese should have left at least an hour or more on the cutting room floor. If it takes you 3hrs 30 mins to tell a story then there's something wrong."
205," So bad I turned it off
","This movie was a boring rehash of the same tired gangster movie with the same tired actors who are just older now. I guess it bypassed the theaters and went straight to Netflix because it straight stinks. Don't waste your three and a half hours. Rent The Godfather, Casino or Goodfellas if you want to see the same actors in movies that don't put you to sleep."
206," ""I heard you paint houses.""
","Watched at LFF 2019 Closing Night Gala.Well, those three and a half hours flew by graciously. This is a hefty, meaty film. De Niro, Pacino & Pesci - ALL phenomenal. Pacino especially stole the show for me. What Martin Scorsese accomplishes here is something of a cross between GoodFellas and The Wolf of Wall Street, with sprinklings of the rest of his work throughout.The de-aging (which seems to be the talk at the moment) is pretty solid. Once you adjust your eyes, you forget it's even there. I will say though, the actors are old now, and they clearly don't move like they used to. So it's not so much the 'younger skin' that would be a giveaway, but the way in which the actors move and carry themselves.It is a long film. But not once did I feel like it was outstaying its welcome. The last hour and a half was particularly enjoyable for me - there were some real nice moments between several characters. The script is juicy, with a mix of hilarity, preciseness, and even a little poignancy.It may be the post-film hype talking here, but I think The Irishman is Scorsese's best. It's certainly my favourite piece from him. It feels like a farewell. We'll see how that fares when I rewatch next month on its official release."
207," A pretty good movie, but no Scorsese masterpiece
","Since there are already countless long and drawn-out reviews of this film, I won't subject you to another one. I'll just hand it to you straight. This movie for me definitely had its good gangster moments, but most of it was a sad reminder of an era that will never be again. I'll just focus on the main three actors since, let's be honest, nobody really cares about anybody else here. From a political standpoint, I think DeNiro has been acting like a lowlife degenerate for his blatant disrespect to the President. I left that part aside and remained very objective while viewing the film. I only mentioned that because I don't want any negative review on his performance to be automatically attributed to that, like I know is the case with many others. Had this been 15 or 20 years ago he may have delivered one of the best performances of his career. Here, his age shows... and shows BIG TIME. The de-aging effect really didn't bother me. Watching DeNiro's physicality made his age abundantly clear and it many times distracted from the character's age during that period of time. DeNiro, like his cohorts, moved very stiff in many scenes, almost like he was in physical pain. Nothing about his portrayal was smooth or graceful, even during the character's younger years. Pacino suffered from many of the same issues. I actually think he was horribly miscast here and didn't even look the part. Maybe I'm a bit biased because the 1992 Hoffa movie with Jack Nicholson is one of my favorites; Nicholson gives an A+ performance of Hoffa in that one and looks just like him. Pacino does a lot of yelling and cussing at people here, most of which comes off as laughable before it does intimidating. They could have used him more effectively in another role here, as Hoffa he most certainly is not. It was nice to see Pesci onscreen again, although if you go into this expecting to see the hotheaded maniac of old from the Goodfellas and Casino days, you are going to be sorely disappointed. He plays a more reserved and reflective gangster here, although his menace is still very abundant. I think he did the best job out of the three main actors, although that's not saying all that much to his credit.The Irishman is an okay way to kill a boring afternoon, but I don't think it's one that people will be falling over themselves to re-watch. There are a lot of characters to keep track of and the movie had flashbacks of flashbacks, if that makes any sense. I would recommend that anyone who is entirely unfamiliar with the Hoffa story go watch the 1992 version with Nicholson first. Its plot is a bit more simplified and easier to navigate. Then give this one a try. I agree with many of the other posters about the general feeling of depression that permeates the aura of this film. Not because of anything in the plot. But because we, as lovers of the gangster genre, are very much aware that this was probably the last time at bat for the three main actors. Even if they did make another one down the road, it definitely wouldn't be for the better. It would be nice to take these three guys and freeze them in time to the 1995 versions of themselves and keep making these films forever. Reality dictates otherwise and it's quite a shame to watch these guys playing dollar store versions of what they used to be. Time waits on no one. We're all gonna get there some day as well. Hopefully."
208," I shouldn't have watched this
",It was an undeserving shameful end of a good era. The Irishman is an abomination.
209," I wanted to like this ...
","But i didn't.It's trying too hard to be everything, and ends up being the emperor's new clothes. Both de Niro and Pacino don't convince. It's competently made, but lacks a heart. What a shame..."
210," De Niro is played out
",De Niro is only getting riles these days because he leads the Trump hating brigade. His character acting has been played out. I don't think he knows how to play different than what we've already seen dozens of times. The movie is too long and the youth cgi is terrible.
211," Maybe I watched a bootleg of another film
","After 1 hr 45 I was about to give up, as basically nothing happened. It looked at this point that the film was about to get going; however, it didn't, and I just wasted another 1 hr 45 of my life. Take out the swearing and this would be a PG. Violence doesn't make a film of this genre, but Casino and Goodfellas etc would not have been the films they were without it. The acting is weak and the better acting comes from the unknowns,"
212," Overrated because of the names attached
","This movie was not very good. And honest rating would be a 3 out of 10. I had to go low to make up for all the 10 star ""great cast! Scorcese bla bla bla"" reviews. The performances we're nothing more than mediocre and this film should have been one hour, not three. It was so dragged out. They hired the typical crew of Italian looking stars who are way past their primes. This movie just wasn't good. You'll walk away having wasted 3 hours of your life. If you insist on watching it, ignore the fact that it's a Scorsese film, ignore that DeNiro and pachino and that short guy from lethal weapon are in it. Just watch it and see how bad the acting is. How it's way too long. How the directing is a miss. The guy has made great films, but he's old and clearly lost his touch. This movie wasn't good. Also Hoffa gets killed. Big surprise like we all didn't know. You wanna watch an okay movie about Hoffa? Try watching ""Hoffa""."
213," Masterpiece
","If you can't get by an actor's politics to watch a movie then suit yourself. I certainly don't believe in Deniro's liberal world view. But that's not going to stop me from watching a movie he happens to be in unless the movie itself is political propaganda, which is not the case here. There is no denying the virtuosity of certain actors and watching Deniro, Pacino, Pesci and Keitel all together in one epic film was a rare treat. It's like a renaissance painting in which DaVinci, Michelangelo, Caravaggio and Titian all had a hand. In a thousand years, are the politics of those artists going to matter one fig when it comes to appreciating their creations? What's striking and engrossing about this film is the arc of the narrative that ends where we all know our own lives will end but don't want to think about it: old, infirm, possibly alone, facing our mortality and the possible consequences of our choices in life. We, as men, can empathize somewhat with Sheeran as he tries to justify his life's choices to his estranged Daughter as his attempt to protect his family from the horrors of the world. We observe Deniro as he is preparing for his own end. We watch Sheeran's attempt at confession as a Catholic priest incredulously tries to evoke repentance from a man who is so morally callous that he cannot even summon the remorse needed to save his own soul. The priest is left with no option but to fudge a loophole that he hopes will gain his supplicant absolution, but probably won't. In the end, we watch voyeuristically as Sheeran is reduced to selecting his own coffin. It is due to Deniro's virtuosity that Sheeran seems simultaneously both disturbed and matter-of-fact as he does so. In the end, we see Sheeran, alone, in a nursing home contemplating his past and its consequences. And we find ourselves wondering if Sheeran, on some level, is us."

222," A Profoundly Moving Tale of Loyalty, Betrayal, and Guilt
","Scorsese's mob films (I'll lump Wolf of Wall Street in with them) are harshly critical of organized crime and the destruction these criminals bring down on everyone around them. However, those sequences when the world comes crashing down around the main characters are explosive and fast, never leaving enough time for reflection on the crimes committed and the lives ruined. 'The Irishman' takes the time to focus on the guilt-ridden aftermath. That focus turns the film into a profoundly moving piece.I will first say that the otherwise masterful editing is weak in the opening 45 minutes. The film inter-cuts too often between the establishing scenes and events that take place much later. Without any context, these edits struck me as awkward and pointless. This is a nothing complaint, just don't be too worried if the opening feels a little odd.The foundation of the film is the moral struggle of De Niro's Frank Sheeran. Sheeran is both a trusted associate of the mob and a trusted friend of Jimmy Hoffa's teamster union. The tensions between Hoffa and the mob place Sheeran in the middle of two stubborn and powerful forces. De Niro's acting is subtle beyond belief. Sheeran is a cold hard professional, and any melodrama from the character would be a misstep. The film itself effortlessly sidesteps any cheap emotional frills where they easily could have surfaced. Nevertheless, we can always see into Sheeran's head and understand the moral questions he is facing.The aftermath of the struggle is where 'The Irishman' shines though. We see what happens to these men in old age. Powerful mobsters don't often die of natural causes. Throughout the film, we are greeted with slightly comical blurbs telling how and when various mobsters died (often via violence). But what about those who live to see 80. These men didn't build lives to last, and so we see them limp on to deeply depressing deaths.That is the point of 'The Irishman.' Even when mobsters live, they live only to see that their lives were pathetic. It is a reflection on the price that a mob life inflicts on those who live it, and those around them. That makes this the ultimate mob film. The sense of fun that lasted to the final scenes of 'Goodfellas' is overridden by somber reflection. There cannot be anything but a depressing ending."
223," This movie is bad
","It's time for DeNiro, Pacino, Pesce, and Scorsese to retire. 9 and 10 stars?? You people have low expectations of movies anymore. DeNiro is too stiff to play the part; he can barely walk, too much stuttering, and he has the same one dimensional face throughout the movie. Pacino plays the same old raspy voiced wild-eyed character, and Pesce is relegated to being a nice old grandfather, who never curses anymore. This was slow, way too long, and not entertaining...a long way from Goodfellas."
224," This is NOT a Masterpiece
","Seriously, critics? This movie borrows so much from Scorsese's previous gangster pics, that it feels derivative and boring. Pesci is the only actor that shines, giving more nuance to his role. De Niro and Pacino play another version of their usual characters. I would have liked it more as a limited series, but as a three-and-a-half hour film with no intermission, it drags. At least the last thirty minutes are really poignant. That and Pesci save it from being a miscalculated disaster in my book."
225," Boring
","Not that great. Actors are great, but movie is boring.
One of many movies about gangsters.
Disappointed."
226," Instant Classic
","Scorsese, De Niro, Pacino, and Pesci are all operating at the top of their game. The 3 1/2 hour run time never sags. One of the great crime epics. Not since Once Upon A Time in America has a gangster epic been so superb."
227," So so
","Nothing special about this movie, cgi make it silly at times. Story over long, nice to see the old actors, but would never watch again."
228," are the raving reviews for real?
","First of all, GET SOME YOUNGER ACTORS. I was not fooled for one second that i wasnt watching 75 year old men pretending to be men in their prime. sure the cgi makes their faces look younger, but it also looks ridiculous and distracting, but its the way they talk, move, and carry themselves in general that makes it very clear they were very old men. i was having a hard time figuring out how old they are supposed to be because it was just so bizarre. second, it felt so forced to be like a remake of good fellas and not a movie of its own. the same sound track played in most significant scenes and felt so over used. third, and so many parts pointlessly dragged on (especially as the movie went on) they could have easily cut an hour out of the movie and it wouldnt have taken an ounce away from the story. only reason i am giving 4 stars is because pescis acting was great, and the story is good regardless of how pointlessly dragged out it was.this is coming from a massive scorsese fan, iv been excited to see this since i heard it was being made almost 2 years ago, but it was a pretty big disappointment for me."
229," Boring attempt by a few has been actors to be young again. Sorry, but I'm not into geriatrics playing younger thems... it never works very well.
","Sorry, this film is over three hours of Robert Denero acting like who he thinks he is...a young tough guy... He isn't anything except old and in this movie he played old really well. Perhaps for his next role he could play someone old and dying...."
230," One Gangster film too far for De Niro
",It's a film that really should have sealed that envelope for Robert De Niro but the decision to make him look younger was a disaster. You will see a fight scene that will make you think they should have employed younger actors to play younger parts. Such a shame as the non fictional story line deserves more class.
231," Another great Mafia movie.
","I think it's strange that some people think this movie is overrated, or even worse, rating it anything lesser than a seven. I agree that Martin Scorsese made better movies but to say this one is bad is just ridiculous. If you like the mobster genre you will like this one as well. It's a story worth to be told, as most of the people (at least the older generation) know all the characters from newspaper headlines, books or movies. The Irishman is long, very long, but I wasn't bored for one second, and for that alone it's already an achievement. I think this movie is worth all the nominations it got, the make up is the only thing that could have been better. But what to say about the cast? Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, Joe Pesci, those are all names that always deliver, certainly in Mafia related movies. The rest of the cast was also perfect for this movie. To me Martin Scorsese is the master in this genre. Every mob movie he made is a delight to watch and so is The Irishman."
232," Scorsese Masterpiece
","I love the basis of when this film takes place and it's even cooler because I live in the Philadelphia area.Martin Scorsese does an amazing job of making this filmmaking match the storytelling. Some of my favorite parts were interactions between Frank and his daughter - especially when they were eating breakfast after he killed someone on a mission the night prior and the wide angle lens makes it feel close. It's as though Frank's daughter knew what was going on, but since there was nothing said, the filmmaking fills the silence void.I enjoyed this film with a great film crew and cast."
233," More than just a mafia tale
","This has to be the last hurrah for the great De Niro and Pesci, doing another Scorsese flick together. Here they are not always believably playing young(ish) men some of the time. It is interesting to see Ray Romano playing a smooth lawyer. If this was just a gangster flick, it would not be a great one, but it is memorable because it is more than that. This is a tale about morality and loyalty. It presents the life story of a decent, loyal guy, a devoted family man and trustworthy buddy - who is also a crook and a cold-blooded killer, a Mafia operative and hit man, a guy who would shoot a friend in the face or the back if it was called for. The long ending and slow start recall the films of an earlier era, as does the prolonged presentation of the Jimmy Hoffa story."
234," Greats of Gangster films play age inappropriate roles
","I have the greatest respect for Mr. Scorsese. I adore that he brought the band together of Gangster Film Greats: Deniro, Pacino and Pesci. Even the supporting cast are heavyweights: Paquin, Keitel, and Romano. The casting was a great business choice; it surely got us all to watch, didn't it?However, this film was seriously miscast for the story. The roles these guys were playing belonged to actors 30 years younger than they are; and in the case of ""The Kid"" Deniro: 50 years younger than him; and even though Scorsese tried to overcome this issue with technology, the 30 years gap is simply too hard to breach. I wonder... why is this subject being blatantly ignored? Can you imagine how the public would be up in arms if women played roles written for someone 30 years younger? Would that movie receive even one Oscar nomination? On this year alone, 2020, I have watched several films where women in their 20s portray characters in their 30s, and good luck finding a movie with actresses in their 40s or 50s.On a positive note: This movie is very well researched. For me, to see this on Netflix was the best venue possible. I watched it twice. The first time, I watched the full movie over 2 days, and the second time, on my computer with the occasional split-screen while I googled the names and delved deeper into the stories of the Chicago Mafia characters, the government guys who ended up in the Nixon impeachment hearings, the Bay of Pigs, etc. I loved it."
235," Great film and greater actors!
","Scorsese reverts back to his old fort with this. It isn't a Goodfellas, which many people expected it to be. It is a rather different and engaging character study from a director who has done so much of gangsta stuff. The cinematography is worth appreciating in the way it tracks Frank Sheeran's rise through ranks, his internal conflicts and Jimmy Hoffa's fall.
But the hefty deaging somehow wasn't as convincing. Still a brilliant film, especially the last thirty or so minutes which again pretty much sums up how good Scorsese is in this genre."
236," Congratulations martin scorsese
","So far the only good netflix movie, but only because PESCI,PACINO,DE NIRO are 3 sacred actors and having a director who is a legend has helped to complete this movie"
237," Pretty good but it could have been shorter
","I enjoyed the movie but I think that some scenes were too long but nevertheless good movie, classic Scorsese fashion."
238," Making House Painting Interesting
","The Irishman is much, much more than a ""mafia movie"". It is a lens into the US culture in the second half of the twentieth century and, probably, one of the most definitive lenses.Reuniting De Niro, Pacino and Pesci was certainly an amazing feat but if you're expecting another Godfather or Goodfellas, forget it. This movie is not an insight into the mafia and its various manifestations but juxtaposes three different elements, each of which in its own right could easily justify (and in some cases has) a one or two part series.Scorsese and his team very effectively intertwine the mafia, the Teamsters and the Kennedy clan into a bubbling cauldron that spits out some interesting overspill, such as the line ""if they can do that to Kennedy, then......."".At 3.5 hours long you might think this is a long movie but it really does not feel like that, it is so well made. Granted some of the earlier scenes can get a little confusing as we move from very old Frank, to old (middle-aged?) Frank to ""young"" Frank (still old De Niro) but get that past that and you have a fascinating movie that steers you towards answers to some of the fascinating mysteries that define the Kennedy/Nixon era."
239," Snooze...
","""The Irishman""
or
""Hit the snooze""The problem in ""The Irishman"" is not in the acting; Pesci, DeNiro, and Pacino are all top form. The problem is not in the story itself, as the behind the scenes of Jimmy Hoffa and his cronies is an excellent premise. Where Irish falters is in screenplay and execution in direction. Bits and pieces of Scorcese's brilliance are there, but unfortunately they are few and far between. The soundtrack is brilliant as it matches the period, but there's little in terms of relating with the characters and the plot. The pacing is so bad and the characters are so one note, for at least the first 90 minutes, that you feel left out. The next 60 minutes move at a blistering pace, enjoyable at best, and the last 30 minutes are wasted on drawn out dialogue that leads to a far less desirable ending than expected. When Pesci is in, generally the film shines. Pacino and Deniro are best when they do not share the screen, as seen in ""Heat,"" and ""Righteous Kill."" The Irishman is a wasted opportunity, and if you feel the need to see a film about Jimmy Hoffa, catch ""Hoffa"" with Jack Nicholson and Danny DeVito.6/10"
240," JOE FRIGGIN PESCI
","Scorsese probably thinks he made a better film than he actually has. The Irishman is excellent, but there are several superfluous scenes that shouldn't have made the cut. For example, Frank Sheeran's phone call to Jo Hoffa that was essentially two minutes of mumbling dialogue that had no consequences or importance. Scorsese just likes being complete, even if it weakens the film. Especially the last 30 minutes that proceeded the final Hoffa scene, which in itself was anticlimactic. Could have made the Hoffa house 10 minutes of tension, arguing, moral quandaries, and betrayal, but NOPE. Just a little BOOP, and we move on. But seriously, the last 30 minutes post-Hoffa could have been 8 minutes max.Al Pacino was as good as he has ever been. He played Jimmy Hoffa with a lot of gusto and attitude that made him believable, yet surprisingly powerful in the face of major crime families. Reminded me a lot of Scarface with his energy here, though far less of a psychopath.DeNiro was unfortunately the weakest of the three. His acting was excellent, but it was also a role we've essentially seen him play before. He plays Frank Sheeran hard and cold, but loves his friends (Hoffa and Russell) to death, which was key to getting us to connect with this mass murderer. Very good on that component. However, the major problem with his role was he wasn't in a position of power. DeNiro shines stronger than any actor when given lines that display a powerful role, but Sheeran was essentially an attack dog, following orders, asking permission for much of the film. The role didn't allow him to show the full range of his acting prowess, was kind of disappointing. Still good though.PESCI was unreal. Incredibly, this is Pesci's best role of his life. When Russell Buffalino starts talking, you frequently forget you're watching a film. Just enthralling to watch him on screen. It feels like you're a fly on the wall watching a true mobster do business. And this role is so unique for him. Gentle, and kind, and rational, yet hardened and cruel. Seriously deserves an oscar for this one."
241," Very very boring
","Yes we have the likes of big stars such as Ray Romano, Robert DeNiro, Al Pacino, Joe Pesci among others in this but 3 hours is way too long man. Anyways there wasn't much action going on and the actual history trying to surround the whole thing wasn't that straight forward as it should. I think the film needed to have more action and less time to drag in order make it really that good.Yeah it's disappointing that I wasted my time watching this film but I still think the big stars do have great potential in doing other good stuff rather than this one......."
242," Same old, same old
","I'm sorry... I know I'm alone here as everyone else is gushing about it... but this movie stinks.It's just another gangster movie, using the same actors from all the other gangster movies, basically in a re-run of the last gangster movie you watched. The only original part of this film is that Pesci plays a subdued character instead of a wild man. That's it.On top of feeding us 3+ hrs of leftovers, none of these characters are developed well. I don't care about any of them... whether the live or die... and I should.It's quite simply 3hrs of your life wasted watching a bunch of Italians fight over who disrespects whom, but without any cool car chases or gun battles. It's 3hrs of boredom... 3hrs of a movie you've already seen somewhere else before.If you live for gangster movies, you'll love it anyway... but I was bored watching Pacino and DeNiro play characters they've played before... the stereotypical Italian mob gangster... for over 3hrs... lol"
243," Absolutely Masterful
","I can barely believe these men are not actually Frank Jimmy and Russ. Never once for a microsecond do they step ourside their characters into their own skins, the humility and measured control of de Niro's performance is utterly awe inspiring. Pacino, what can I say, no words and the steady rudder throughout commanding and powerful Joe Pesci's character Russ. Great supports (Jesse Plemens underused again but a minor quibble). Better be plenty of Oscars here, I wasn't that interested in Jimmy Hoffa but wasn't bored for a second and that is totally down to the performances and Scorese' s wonderful eye and pacing every detail perfect. Masterpiece."
244," Scorsese at his best
","Firstly to all the people saying it's too long and boring go watch another superhero movie then.
The Irishman is definitely not boring, nobody makes films like this these days that's why people aren't understanding it, and others are comparing it to casino and goodfellas saying it's not as good, but your forgetting this is a true story where casino and goodfellas are fictional so there made to be entertaining the Irishman is telling a story through the years, although in my opinion it is still extremely entertaining.
Every actor here did extremely well Robert DeNiro Joe Pesci and even Stephen Graham did extremely well fitting in with the Hollywood legends but for me Al Pacino was amazing and although him and DeNiro between them haven't done much in years shows they still got it in them under the right director. Scorsese of course.
This film is brilliantly directed and acted by all involved I highly recommend the Irishman it really does take you back in time to the time in which the movie is based."
245," Way Too Long
","Sadly I have to agree with many reviewers this film is probably at least 30 minutes too long maybe even more. At times events unfold at a boring if not turgid pace. The final journey of Hoffa, the endless fish conversation, frankly was amateirish and tedious.
Pesci was stand out De Nero mmmnah not so much. His at times stolid , wooden acting seemed to slow down what little pace the movie had.
A lifetime work by Scorcese ? please tell .me no and that there is better, sharper things to come"
246," Mixed feelings.....!
","A long ( too long!? ) movie that left me with a mixed feelings, some useless scenes and boring dialogs almost ruined Scoreses piece, but a very interesting story and a sublime acting ( especially Pesci ) saved the movie without forgetting the sad and brilliant ending ( the last 30 minutes feels like the end for a whole generation). Even with some boring moments this movie deserve the watching and enjoying some great cinema, the one i like without too much CGI only pure genius actors and director!"
247," You can retire watching this movie!
","About six hours into this Goomba snooze-fest, I hit the button on the AppleTV remote to see I was only HALF WAY THROUGH IT! At first, I refused to watch this because Robert DiNiro was in it. I wish I had stuck with that. This movie meandered endlessly, using real-life events as a backdrop, and presented a bunch of aging, paunchy old men spitting out twenty ""dese"" and ""dose"" per line of forced dialogue, to try and add the wise guy authenticity. The de-aging CGI at the beginning was some of the worst I've ever seen, making the actors look like they were wearing rubber masks. Anyone who's seen Michael Douglas at the beginning of Ant-Man knows that this can be accomplished seamlessly. This reminds me so much of another Scorcese decathlon that everybody but me seemed to love, Casino. The best thing I can say about this movie, is that I didn't have to pay to see it!"
248," Review the movie for what it is, not for what it's not
","A very common thing that many people do when they review a movie is doing so based too much on what they were expecting. And I understand, everyone had high expectations for this film, and it's normal to be disappointed, but that's not necessarily the movie's fault.Many people disliked The Irishman because they were expecting to see another Goodfellas. I mean, if you want to see something like Goodfellas so bad, then go and watch Goodfellas. Don't blame The Irishman for not being something that it's not trying to accomplish.As you may guess, I thought this movie was great. I sit throughout the shortest three and a half hours of my life, and I was so impressed that I had to watch it again the very next day. Robert De Niro and Al Pacino are finally acting for real again, and Joe Pesci makes a great comeback with his greatest performance since, well, Goodfellas.The only thing that I didn't find so marvelous was the CGI used to make the protagonists look younger; at times, it can be very distracting, specially seeing that the characters at a certain age move and talk like older people. However, this didn't ruin my experience at all.I think that what makes Scorsese so great it's that, despite his age and his long career as a filmmaker, he's still making movies as good as the ones he made 30 or 40 years ago (can't say the same about Steven Spielberg, Brian De Palma, Ridley Scott or other directors that were once great), and I'm sure that he is not going to stop very soon.After Parasite, The Irishman is by far my second favorite film in a year that has been great for cinema, and I can't encourage you enough to watch it, as long as you know what you're going for."
249," Disapointing, Slow and Long.
",First of all I could not get past the fact that no matter how hard they tried Deniro never looked young enough for the timeline they were trying to cover. Story was extremely slow thank god it was on Netflix. Was not bad but was not necessary. Seemed like these guys wanted to revisit the glory of their past and missed the mark.
250," Stylish, classy, but indulgent and LONG
","The Irishman is a beautifully shot, terrifically acted movie. It's reminiscent of these fine actor's earlier gangster epics, but it is not without it's issues. Some of which are glaring.Firstly, and most noticeably is the running time. Don't get me wrong. I have no issues with attention span. In my view a movie can be as long as it wants. So long as it fills that time well. The Irishman could have easily been reined-in by 45 minutes at least, without ever hurting the plot or feel of the movie. Sadly, I found myself clock watching on a few occasions in it's three and a half hour run time, and my partner...well she fell asleep at two hours twenty.
As an example, almost an hour of the movie is essentially De Niro going ""you gotta calm down, Jimmy"" and Al Pacino replying ""I won't calm down, Franky"". We get it already, he's stubborn, the mob are annoyed.
It is still watchable at this length, (if you have some grit) which is testament to those involved, but it's pushing it and pushing it hard. At times feeling over indulgent. I imagine it would have suffered harsher reviews, had it been a cinema release. The comfort of your own couch, bathroom and access to coffee goes a long way here.The other issue for me, was the use of Pacino and particularly De Niro, in portraying their characters younger selves. I can't help but feel it would have been more effective to use younger actors of a similar appearance to portray these characters in their earlier years. I have the utmost respect for everyone involved in this, but there comes a point when you have to accept that these guys are no spring chickens. There is some skilled use of makeup (CGI?), but no amount of makeup could hide Pacino's aging posture. He is pushing 80 after all. Yet Here at stages in the movie, Pacino is supposed to be Jimmy Hoffa in his 50's and 60's, possibly even younger.
Worse still, De Niro's character Frank Sheeran is frequently referred to as ""kid"", yet even with makeup/effects/hair dye he appears to be in his 50's or 60's. Not bad for a guy pushing towards eighty, right?... Not so great when you consider the reality that Sheeran was in his mid twenties when he met Russel Bufalino and began working for the mob. No amount of 'Just For Men' is pulling that illusion off.Negatives aside, the scenery, attention to detail, costumes and cinematography are all excellent, as is the acting by everyone involved. And, even if you already know the history surrounding Hoffa and the unions, it's still a fairly compelling story.
I found it watchable and enjoyed it in part, but I feel it would have had a lot more impact at a shorter run time. I would have easily given this 8 or 9 out of 10, had it cut to the chase a bit sooner and maybe not leaned so heavily on the makeup team."
251," Honestly, it was nice to see a movie that wasn't PC
","Aside from everything being top notch in this movie, an unforeseen joy for me was seeing something that wasn't a board room movie. The story is told how it should be and cast just how it should be. There wasn't anyone forced unnaturally into the cast to fulfill a demographic. And that really helped the movie. I'm not racist or sexist in anyway but when the focus is on making a movie PC and not the story then the quality of the movie is going to suffer.And everybody picks up on this, including the people that they are spoon feeding to. Look at the recent PC board room movies that have come out: Terminator: Dark Fate and Charlie's Angels and they have bombed. People want good movies, not crap that thinks it's culturally aware.They need to return to this style of movie making, letting the director's make their movies and not demographics. I hope Hollywood is paying attention or else all of the high quality movies are going to be made independent from them."
252," Disappointed
","This movie ,the Irishman is embarrassing. You can't have old men playing the parts designed for actors 40 years younger. Every scene involving their children looked like a joke or a cartoon or a Saturday night live skit. I'm an old man myself and it was embarrassing for me to watch. And sure the acting was good. It should be good ....these guys of been playing the same role all their lives. There was nothing new in the movie it was way too long ..way too slow ,and way too boring. I find it disappointing that every critic fell in line to praise this Scorsese film. Actually it's a dis-service to the man"
253," Simply fantastic
","Honestly what a great film. Wish it was longer , shame it wasn't a series as it was that good and well directed I was gutted when it finished."
254," Should be called ""Goodfellas in Depends Diapers""
","Very very very long film. Horribly depressing story of a labor racketeer/hitman for the mob with ties to Jimmy Hoffa, (if anyone actually remembers Hoffa) who is telling his story from present day in an assisted living facility where he is wheelchair bound. There are no likable main or even secondary characters in the entire film. All of the old mafia movie standard actors are recycled in this film hopefully for one last time - Pacino, DeNiro, Kietel, and many more and are far far too old to have been in this regardless of the makeup, girdles and hair color. Should have had much younger actors portray these geezers in the first part of the movie which is set in the 1950's and 1960's. Even in the beginning of the film where the DeNiro (noticeably overweight) character is supposed to be about 40, you can see that he has trouble walking normally since he is really in his 70's. The actresses playing their wives are far too young for these geriatric actors. Their daughters could easily be their grand daughters. It is a dull film that relies on the many of the techniques that were successful in Goodfellas and Casino but does not work well in this. Too many dumb scenes of Pacino (Hoffa) shoveling ice cream into his mouth and complaining about his cronies coming 15 minutes late to a meeting. Explains why it went to Netflix so fast."
255," Disappointed
","As a big film fan I could not wait to watch this !! Was great too see such big names in a movie together but feel the length of this let it down. After 2.5 hours I was bored hoping the last hour would change my mind, unfortunately it did not."
256," What's up with De Niro's eyes?
","I enjoyed the movie and it was great seeing all these great actors together in a movie. Not a ""Magnus Opus"", like some people are calling it, but definitely worth seeing. It had a classic maffia movie vibe!Just one thing; what was up with De Niro's eyes? His pupils seemed to be dilating at ghe wrong times. It was distracting."
257," What are we celebrating?
","I love De Niro, Pacino, Pesci and Scorsese. I love really good old age make-up, good acting, great sets, period costumes, tunes that set the mood of the era, and fine cinematography. This film contained all of these elements. What it didn't have was believability, for one. De Niro and Pacino, well into their 70s, were playing guys in their 40s to 50s. The special effects used to ""de-age"" them, and Pesci, were ridiculous. It made De Niro look like Yul Brenner from the original West World. And Pesci calling De Niro ""kid?"" Gimme a break! Okay, another issue was the very forgettable, cardboard cutout, cliched cast. Paquin walked through scenes like a zombie, Romano is a t.v. actor who belongs on t.v., Cannavale and Keitel didn't have enough screen time and everyone else, like I said, was forgettable. Thirdly, the 3 1/2 hours running time seemed longer than that. Long films are fine, if they're good, if they move along and if they are interesting. This one was slow and plodding, featuring silly, nonsensical exchanges and scenarios. There were scenes that could have easily been chopped. Heck, the director and three leads would all have to take two bathroom breaks each if they sat through this. The Irishman may very well be Scorsese, De Niro and Pacino's celebrated last hurrah, however, is it being celebrated for what it is, or for who they are?"
258," Majestic Crime Epic! Oscars!
","Martin Scorsese excellence strikes back!This remarkable film achievement was a great joy to watch and will not disappoint, with great oscar winning performances from DeNiro, Pacino and Pesci. Multiple oscars incoming!Zaillians back to his best with this exceptional screenplay, by far his best work within the last decade!"
259," the uncanny valley is strong in this one
","Let's start with this. The 3 main characters younger facial reconstruction is just deep down in the uncanny valley. Especially De Niro's. I found it really hard not to get sucked out of the movie every time they're on screen. I get it that the film's appeal relies a lot on their casting. But i'd have rather had less emblematic actors doing the job without CGI makeup and with classic makeup for the scene in which they're older. Scorsese is a huge name enough to not have to cast these 3 as the main characters too. They could have played smaller roles and left some room for the next ""them"".
The CGI is sometimes very good and sometimes it's botched. When you're focused on that kind of stuff you cannot help yourself from watching the blurry chins, the hair lines that don't match, etc.
When you've seen several Pacino and De Niro movies you are used their younger body shapes and moves, and in this movie they just don't match. They move like older people, you can definitely feel it.
This is why I think traditional cinema should stay away from CGI and that kind of trick.De Niro and Pacino just play too much a parody of themselves. It's like they were polyvalent actors when they were young and lost it by being typecast way too many times. This has a tendency to suck the audience out of the movie too : when you think ""oh De niro is doing the De Niro inverted smile again"" instead of just staying in the movie's flow. Don't get me wrong : they do the job really well, but it's like watching a brand new movie about someone saving the world, and BAM : it's Bruce Willis, and he's making jokes. BTW Pesci nailed it, he didn't ""Pesci in Goodfellas""-ed his role. All the other actors are just top notch, with some very pleasant surprises, such as Stephen Graham as a mafia boss.Scorsese does the job. Like always. Although he rested on his laurels and did almost not take any risk. There are very few directing stunts compared to his other works. But that's ok, it looks it was the point of the movie : stay classic. Or maybe... knowing that there would be a huge CGI work on the movie he chose not to make any complex camera shot. Maybe the veeeery academic frame compositions were just a way to make the CGI work easier.The editing isn't perfect. Some cuts just don't match. And it's not some Nouvelle Vague effects, those are supposed to be obvious enough to create their effect. It's just details, such as body position or stuff like this, and it sucks you out of the movie too.
That's a lot of stuff that breaks the flow of the movie and make it hard to follow.The OST is efficient. Same trick as in his other ""historical"" movies : using music as a time marker.So nopes. Definitely not his best work. Still my favorite director."
260," Oscar worthy and don't believe otherwise
","I don't understand some of these negative comments especially referring to the acting. It's some of the greatest actors of the last century together in one epic directed by one of the greatest directors of all time. Is it casino ? No is it good fellas? No. BUT is it an instant classic ? Damn straight.This is the first time a gangster film really paced itself. No parts felt rushed. No parts felt drawn out and at 3+ hours that's a feat in itself. The acting, the de-aging and the story are spectacular as can be expected with the given context.Pacino knocks it out. De Niro kills it and Pesci is a legend simple as that and we are reminded why every time he is on the screen.So ignore the negatives sit back and enjoy what will likely be the last great gangster film for years and years to come.Hats off boys."
261," Look past the mildly distracting de-aging, and you will see a masterpiece
","The Irishman is a film with its own breathing, beating conscience. Throughout the film, we are introduced to characters with the details of the gruesome fates that await each of them plastered on the screen. There is no mistaking many of these are dead men walking. Men with their fates sealed into the actions we are concurrently reliving through the retrospective lens of an older, wiser person.The movie is long. Please, please see it in theaters, as it may be the last new Scorsese film you can do so, but start it with an empty bladder. It's no Wolf of Wall Street in pacing, but it's paced exactly where it needs to be, and never gets slow or disengaging. It's apparent that a lot of thought goes into instilling these moments with extra meaning or tension, from smelling something fishy to giving alcohol metaphors as someone who strictly doesn't drink.Acting is superb from the entire cast. Pacino is very Pacino, Pesci carries an intimidatingly loud silence, De Niro is great in every scene, and Anna Paquin gives a phenomenal ghostly presence. She may very well have given the Oscar-nominated performance with the fewest lines in history (we'll see, Judi Dench...).The de-aging effects have a Polar Express-y softness most noticeable in the early scenes. Makeup is only occasionally distracting (e.g. De Niro's bright blue contacts). And there's an early curb scene that should have been re-shot to be less old man.The Irishman (""I Heard You Paint Houses"") is complete and wholesome cinema. It gives the Netflix generation a hangout sesh with some of cinema's most beloved actors dishing out their same gangster core, but with the mental burden and guilt-ridden glances that haunt an aging hitman. The opening song contains everything Frank ""The Irishman"" Sheeran is about to unfold for us over the next 3½ hours. Over that time the narrative weighs down the tune with a growing heaviness, all the way up until the poignant final shot.This is Scorsese matured and in true form, doing what he does best as a veteran filmmaker and master storyteller, only with the introspection, wisdom, and humanity that confront and reflect on his life's work."
262," Horrible! Long and Boring
",It was like watching paint dry it was so bad. I have always loved these actors but this was just horrible. Scorsese is the real issue here .....it is time to hang it up. retire!
263," ""Grumpy Old Gangsters""
","My husband and I looked so forward to seeing this film. The director, the cast members and the mob, what could go wrong?!Geez, these guys are old. So, too am I. Having lived for 67 years, I've watched these actors since their prime. Too see them now in makeup, pretending to be youthful men just makes me sad.I think this movie was supposed to be their last hurrah. One final trip to the goldmine of movie stardom.Unless you want a good laugh, don't waste your time watching this film."
264," With a gun you charge, with a knife you run!
","Watch this movie on a big screen and watch it attentively, because it's building up into something you gonna like.By the way, De Niro and Pesci are doing stunning job for the entire time. They are genuine and they feel the whole thing. But it's Pacino that outshines, because he is the real Hoffa."
265," I get the criticism, but I thought it was excellent
","As someone who loves (most of) Martin Scorsese's work and especially his old gangster films, 'The Irishman' was always going to be a must-see for me. As I usually do when seeing a movie, I went into this without watching the trailer and with as little knowledge or expectations about the story/film as possible, and I was not disappointed.'The Irishman' is excellent, another masterwork by Scorsese and up there with my favourite gangster films, though probably not quite on the same level as the likes of 'The Godfather' and 'Goodfellas'. It looks fantastic with great cinematography and some smart use of CGI for anti-ageing effects. I really enjoyed the storyline, which has depth yet is relatively easy to follow, and the characters are very convincing.If it has any flaws they are certainly very minor and did not affect my enjoyment of the film. I would normally tend to agree with the criticism of the excessive length - nobody want to sit staring at a screen for three-and-a-half hours - but I'm prepared to make an exception for 'The Irishman' as it held my interest throughout. A fantastic film and another Scorsese classic."
266," I'm baffled by the positive reviews??
","This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen! It's badly acted, has a predictably sweary and poorly written off the shelf gangster movie script and is over 3 hours long!!If you're at all unsure about my viewpoint, please before subjecting yourself to the agony of sitting through this movie, go to 28 minutes and 10 seconds in and watch the 30 second scene where DeNiro beats up a shop keeper, if you still feel it's worth investing in the whole movie after that shockingly bad piece of acting, then so be it.Awful movie, awful script, awful acting and way too long!!"
267," Reviewed the movie, as well as the director, because he wrote and directed it
","There's a lot of people out there defending this movie and making it seem like it's genuinely good, but deep down, you know that it's not.I remember the days when Martin Scorsese, even in recent memory with silence 2014, Wasn't a scared little boy. When he made films that are considered art. This is not art.The cast should be ashamed, but most of all Martin Scorsese should be ashamed. He gave up the chance to direct Joker for this, He was even so scared that he stopped producing it as well. When did Martin Scorsese become such a wimp? Where is that Sly Fox that made such great movies like Raging Bull, the king of comedy, Taxi Driver and ao many more great movies that are art? Guess he died while making this sad excuse from a film.The film drags on and on, and like a corpse tied to the back of a horse, by the time it reaches town, its nothing more than a bloody stump of a hand tied to a thin, well drug rope. What a waste of both time and talent."
268," Greatly anticipated but totally disappointing
","I'm a huge fan of Scorcese, DeNiro, Pacino, etc. but was disappointed in this collaboration.This story of how Jimmy Hoffa intrigued me since I was a kid and I believe out of all the theories of how Hoffa died, this is the most believable. I dont necessarily agree that the movie went too long but there were way too many 1-scene characters that only muddied the flow of the story. But it was still a good storyline.The acting on the other hand was my biggest disappointment. First, they should have played this like GF2, with younger actors portraying the older. As good as DeNiro can be, he was not believable as a young man, just watch him throw a handgun let alone a punch. Pacino was just okay, but I thought Pesci and Harvey Kaitel were very good and was pleasantly surprised at Ray Romano's acting. Most of the supporter characters had either poor lines or bad direction.The scene where JFK died was a stereotypical scene, but totally unbelievable since the people watching the television newscasts were truly pissed at the Kennedy family for letting them down after the election. Should have been written differently to be believable. That was just a simple example of the writing being poor but the directing was not much better.Hopefully this isn't Scorsese's swan song."
269," Pretty much same ole same ole
","If you have seen Goodfellas or Casino, then you have pretty much seen The Irishman. Same style filming just slightly different story. De Niro shows his age. Nice to see Pesci back on the big screen. No real surprises on this one. Long movie, good acting, but it just feels like every other gangster movie."
270," How can you go wrong with Scorsese, De Niro, Pacino and Pesci?
","First, if you haven't noticed, it's a three and a half hours long movie, so make sure you pee before the movie starts, especially if you've bought one of those supersize soft drinks with your popcorn. That being said, the movie is not fast paced but it will be over faster than you might think; or not, but it did for me. The one short sentence IMDb storyline ""A mob hitman recalls his involvement with the slaying of Jimmy Hoffa"" is to the point and there's little more to it than that, but it's a Scorcese movie so it doesn't require much more.Scorsese can deliver a mobster movie like no one else. There are actual real life characters and facts to season this dish of a movie, as the director loves to do, and he has a well deserved reputation for doing that. What this movie has, no previous ones by Scorsese do, to the best of my memory, is seeing the characters over a very long period of time, from early start in their life of crime, to their death. The special effects to the physical appearances of De Niro, Pesci and Pacino are noteworthy, very, and is of course what was needed to make the movie believable. All three main actors delivered performances equal to what you'd expect, perhaps one of Pesci's best in my opinion, perhaps.Aside from the main three, there was a big cast with many actors we are all familiar with and that's always a plus. I noticed that Ray Romano continues to depart from his stand-up comedy and sitcom characters, in this movie, as he has with his role in the series 'Get Shorty' and I hope he continues to do that. Harvey Keitel's short and few scenes demonstrate how and why he has had success with his career (I'm a fan).Finally I will leave you with a personal experience this movie gave me; it might just be something some of you will feel as well, just some of you; when it was all said and done, I felt old, it's the only way I can describe it, but please don't let that deter you from watching it."
271," Lot of scorsese fans here ...
","Watched every Scorsese movie, such a great movie it is, I've seen an De Niro old and not in his top anymore I didn't believe his character, maybe of course it's an Scorsese boy he is been always in his movies, a great plot with a few holes I think in the intimity of the character, al Pacino outstanding, he steals the entire movie, the goat, Pesci in his top, greates actors of all time you create a great movie no doubt, too long and some scenes unnecessary, again I think I saw a De Niro not in his top, too political, not his best but not for a 10 it is overrated by the media"
272," Prodigious and astonishing, but not without flaws.
","The Irishman is supposed to be THE film for Netflix. With a $160 million budget and this year's most wanted de-aging technique (ref. Gemini Man), legendary director Martin Scorsese's long awaited new film has a lot of eyes and hungry fans to please. It's definitely made to be seen on a streaming platform, but with a 209 minute runtime, will this be a hit for Netflix?A mob hitman, Frank ""The Irishman"" Sheeran (Robert De Niro), is a man with a lot on his mind. The former labor union high official and hitman, learned to kill serving in Italy during World War II. Recalling his possible involvement with the disappearance of his life-long friend, Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino), the former president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters.Scorsese's mobster tale is a classic in the making. But it isn't flawless. The well known director makes some interesting choices to tell The Irishman's story. We see old Frank in a retirement home, sharing the events of his life with the audience, just like grandpa used to do when visiting on a Sunday afternoon. We go back and forth in time, sometimes up to 40 years back. With the use of de-aging VFX, we see De Niro and co.'s faces through an Instagram-filter, to make them look 40 years younger. It's not a bad technique of visual effects, and it's important to tell the story, but it doesn't work as well as you'd hope it would. Especially in the very first scene, you notice how flawed the technique is when wrinkles are ironed out of Pesci and De Niro's faces, yet when zooming in on their hands you can clearly tell their real age.Blue-contacts-wearing De Niro, gives a typical calm and collected De Niro-performance. He's a good actor, and his more nuanced work in this film is near the end when he gets to work with more emotional material. A very touching note to end the film on. Joe Pesci, who plays Russell Bufalino, knocks it out of the park. His comeback to the big screen is powerful, captivating and career-defining. But the one actor I didn't expect to like as much as I did, is Al Pacino. His performance as Jimmy Hoffa is both spiritual and worthy of every award coming award season. It was like as if he was possessed by the outrageous Hoffa himself - memorable and uncanny.What bothered me throughout the film, was the use of music. I don't mind a piece of music to distinguish certain parts in a story from another, especially when you're going through so many different decades, but Scorsese uses so much music here, sometimes unsuitable to what's happening on screen, it takes away the power of the event. Robbie Robertson's score however, was delightful. Steven Zaillian's screenplay, based on Charles Brandt's book ""I Heard You Paint Houses"", is strong when it wants to be and reminded me of Tarantino's heavy dialogue work, but is mostly inconsistent in pacing and engagement. The film is three and a half hours long, you're going to have some slower bits, but at least hold your audience's attention. The jokes rarely land, but I'd like to say humour is subjective. I feel like some of you might absolutely love most of the script's boffolas, it just didn't land with me.The supporting cast is substantial. From under-utilised Oscar winner Anna Paquin (as Peggy Sheeran) to celebrated Hollywood star cameos such as Harvey Keitel - everyone gets a little screen time in what's already packed as it is. But a lot doesn't get discussed. The families behind these powerful leaders barely have anything to do and just sit around as extras. Although, an unrecognisable Stephen Graham makes a long lasting impression as Hoffa's nemesis, mob boss Anthony Provenzano.The Irishman is like watching a compilation of Scorsese's oeuvre. It's prodigious and astonishing, but not without flaws. This beautifully crafted film is quite small in scope compared to its running time, with perfect production design and the mighty incredible performances make it worth sitting through to the very end. The fact Scorsese decided not to release this piece of work as a mini-series, but as a full length feature film, shows confidence and a little bit of cockiness."
273," 3 hours of my life I'll never get back
","In a word, dull! One of the slowest and worst movies I've ever seen."
274," Don't like the film? ... Pay me!
","I won't say anything that hasn't already been said by other low star reviewers, except I am also disappointed Scorsese fan. I would add spoilers if there was anything worth spoiling. Also, where do I sign up to get paid for writing fantasy/glowing reviews for garbage films?"
275," boring, bad characterization
","I could stand barely the first hour of the movie, it is easy to make a young man look old, but not otherwise, it looks like a parody, this is a major problem with the film, looking men in ther eightys trying to look as if the were 50 years youngermoreover the film is a series of ultra short stories, like flashes of their lives difficult to locate in time because of the previous problem already explainedit looks more like a collection of situations, not well neither explained nor clearly connected, that ended with our decission to stop wasting our time, as no mayor story appeared to evolve in that first houri know it is not fair to judge a whole movie when you have watched less than a third, but this is a consequence of how the film has been made, if within the first hour it does not catch up your interest, definitely it is not worth your time anymorei am the first sorry about this, as I expecte a lot, frome the director and from the excelent casting"
276," How the hell was this garbage nominated for an Academy Award?
","I can't remember wanting to walk out on a movie but after two hours of this borefest I picked up the remote and pushed off. I have no idea how it finished and I don't care. The cynic in me tells me this piece of rubbish was simply designed to top up the actor's retirement funds.
Wooden acting, literally no evident storyline, The Irishman demonstrates clearly how not to make a movie. What puzzles me is that with the truly dreadful reviews who does it get such a high score on here?
And how on earth did the Academy members vote this nonsense into the Best Film award? It is just awful. Everything about it. The acting, the sound, the dumb CGI...and on and on.
Catatonic."
277," Extremely Drawn Out Snooze Fest
","I jumped on the bandwagon with this one. Great cast, great director, but I think people are telling themselves this was a great movie because of that. Incredibly boring, hard to follow at times, slow, drawn out and simply generic. If you're a fan of Scorsese, or these actors, please don't waste your time because you will lose all respect."
278," Scorsese brings back the old Mafia crime movie feeling with his new movie.
","The Irishman is a new crime biography directed by Martin Scorsese, the director of Taxi Driver and Goodfellas.The film is about the hit man of the Mafia Frank Sheeran (Robert DeNiro) about the missing and later murder case of the American trade union leader Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino). The two were lifelong friends and the judicial authorities suspect that Frank knows more about the disappearance and death of Jimmy Hoffa. During this trial, Frank looks back at his life on all the decisions and actions that he has made in his private and criminal life.With this film, Martin Scorsese manages to put down a mafia crime film again, just like the earlier ones were made. As he did with his older crime films such as Goodfellas and Casino. Scorsese also allows the different story lines of the film to run through and past each other in a good way. This way you get a better idea as a viewer how the characters feel or what they think about certain situations they are experiencing. Because of this good way of telling the story of the film you do not notice that the film actually lasts three and a half hours, because once you are in the story, time flies by.Thanks to special effects, they have also succeeded in rejuvenating or aging the cast. After getting used to how the cast looks rejuvenated or outdated, it soon comes across as if you are watching an older film of the actors when they were really young. Because of the appropriate film sets and clothing of the cast, the film also looks realistic as if you went back in time with the characters.The acting work is also done well. The cast consists of a star cast of Oscar winning actors. It's great to see this talent under the direction of Martin Scorsese. Robert DeNiro has played a good major role in this film since The Intern movie of 2015 as a mafia gangster with whom he used to become known as an actor. Since the 2015 film Danny Collins, Al Pacino has again played a good larger role in this film. This is also the first time he has been in a Scorsese film. It's nice to see these two film talents working together on a film. Actor Joe Pesci even returned from his retirement for this film, because since 2010 he has not been featured in films. Despite having been out of the film world for a long time, he still knows how to deliver good acting as a mafia boss. He is a bit quieter and quieter for this role, but he still shows that he can be a danger to his enemies."
279," A dream come true!!!
","Scorsese has always been one of my favourite directors. His films are simply spectacular and I always look forward to what he brings next. When I heard that he was revisiting the mob and crime genre I was thrilled but when I heard that it starred De Niro, Pacino and Pesci my excitement went through the roof. Having seen it, I can confirm that this is one of the best films of the year.The Irishman follows the life of Frank Sheeran, a truck driver, who gets involved with the Bufalino crime family and Teamster Jimmy Hoffa.It felt so good seeing a Martin Scorsese film after a long time. Goodfellas is one of my favourite films of all time so to see another crime mob film with three legends in the lead roles was just a dream come true. However if you're expecting something like Goodfellas, you may be disappointed because The Irishman is very different compared to it. This movie takes its time. It takes its time by fleshing out the characters and creating the feeling of that time period. A lot of the film is dialogue heavy which, by no means, is a bad thing because writer Steven Zaillian brings this world and its characters to life through it.The dialogue is constantly investing and does not get boring at any point. You are sold on the fact that these are real people and not actors portraying them which goes to show how strong everyone's performance is but it also shows the talent Zaillian and Scorsese possess as both are able to keep the story and its people interesting through the film's 3 hour 30 minute runtime. Scorsese's direction is mesmerizing. There is no particular style to it but then again it did not have to have one as the film itself is quite old fashioned. He once again proves to us why he's the best in the business.The acting is outstanding. This is De Niro's best perfomance in a long time and the same goes for Pacino. It felt incredible to see Joe Pesci acting in a film after his retirement. All three had amazing chemistry with one another and it's sad to think that this may be the first and last time we ever see these three together in a Scorsese film. The supporting actors Ray Romano, Stephen Graham, Harvey Keitel and many more were also great in their roles. The CGI used on the actors may be distracting at first glance but as you learn more and more about the story and its characters, the CGI becomes seamless and less of a distraction.The music used is also very appropriate for the time period the film is set in as it creates a wonderful atmosphere to the movie. As mentioned before, the film is shot beautifully but the final shot is one that is quite thought provoking. It really made me think a lot about the many themes the film presents itself with.The only problem I had was to do with Anna Paquin's character. Her character plays a big part in De Niro's character arc but I felt it was not explored as deeply as I wanted it to be.All in all, The Irishman is a fantastic film. Scorsese has given another film that will definitely win some Oscars next year. It felt really refreshing to see a mob film this well executed with three absolute legends acting alongside each other."
280," I failed
","You can polish it, paint it gold, and put sprinkles all over it. IT'S STILL A crap. I made it through a little over an hour of this convoluted, warped high school reunion of a movie. I said I would finish it. Maybe later. Much, MUCH LATER. I have to gargle broken glass now just to eradicate the taste of throwing up in my mouth for an hour."
281," The cast alone is a masterpiece
","Robert de niro reunited with joe pesci, and al pacino FINALLY in a martin scorsese film, Martin scorsese has proved gangster films are still the best of all time"
282," Too boring
","Not engaging, shallow interaction, massive editing needed. Very negative ending, I think I'll be very carful to watch another Scorsese's movie."
283," Boring
","I have only one word for this...
Boring !!
Dont no why rating is so high, only for Robert ?"
284," Boring and Meaningless
","Well, well, well. The Emperor is wearing no clothes the little boy cried out. I really don't get the accolades for this overly long, boring, blood-splattered movie. I get that it is meant to showcase the incredible rapport between the principal actors -- de Niro, Pacino, Pesci and their amazing acting abilities -- oh wow I'm impressed - not really. Another gangster movie by Martin Scorsese and I say big deal. Who cares about these gangsters and their ability to knock each other off, betray each other or not and if lucky live to tell the tale, like our dear Irishman, a totally unsympathetic character if I ever saw one and pretty wooden as an actor in this role sorry to say. YAWN."
285," A mosaic of moments.
","As Scorsese once again returns to familiar territory of the gangster epic one would expect some diminishing returns; the film's deep structure is substantially similar to Goodfellas and Casino. Add in that the main actors are Scorsese mainstays and there was a real chance of this being warmed over hash. Instead, the similarities to earlier films works in the film's favor as Scorsese continues to hone the form. The intertext content causes us to re-examine the prior works.The film is as much about examining a life lived as the inner working of the mob. The story is told in retrospective and the script repeatedly meanders in the way an old man does. De Niro and Scorsese both lean into Frank telling the story (it is a quasi confession) and this allows for a strong sense of time passing; of a life filled with ill fated choices and regret. At 3 hours and change the film is long but the length is for a rich fullness. This is a wonderfully comprehensive film.Scorsese handles the special effects well. The film has some nonlinear editing that helps sell the de-aging. The visual effect themselves are quite good; I was surprised to learn that no make up was used for the three main actors. I had thought it was a blend of practical and CGI work. Even on the basic level of technique this is a interesting film.My favorite aspect of the film is Pesci. It is not only good to see him again but his performance is a masterwork of icy understatement and malice. I don't know if it is a better performance than Goodfellas-the two characters are so different!-but I loved that Pesci choose to be restrained and controlled here. It acts as irony within the film and within his career.This is one of the best films of the year."
286," Solid Film but Hurt by Pacino
",Sub out Pacino for an actor in his prime then give it a re-edit to tighten things up and it's probably an 8.Pacino was at his worst. There were some scenes were they could not hide how decrepit he is. He seem to be in poor physical condition. At times he was struggling to keep his left eye open. He was shouting all of the time. Just a miserable performance. He's a bad Saturday Night Live skit come to life.DeNiro was better than Pacino and in good shape but they could not hide the fact that he's an old man so some of his scenes looked ridiculous. These type of roles have a high floor for DeNiro so he's always solid in them.Everyone else in film was good. Outside of Pacino solid performances all around but the film lacked polish as if it was rushed through the editing process.
287," Somewhat like Goodfellas - Reprise
","Scorsese is never going to match that film in my opinion. It was the pinnacle of his career. The soundtrack, pace, edittng, acting were all just marvelous. And it gave you a look into the mob from ""the working mobster's"" point of view that made all similar mob movies look like garbage, before and after.The Irishman is definitely worth your time, telling the story of mobster Frank Sheeran (De Niro) from his point of view, as he talks about how he befriended and ultimately executed James Hoffa. Realize that this is an unproven theory based on Sheeran's deathbed confession. Of course, how are you going to lose when Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci reunite with Scorsese. I'm not sure Pacino has ever worked with Scorsese before, but he's the pro he always was as Jimmy Hoffa.Since Pesci has been retired from acting for twenty years, the thing that struck me was how OLD he looked. It is actually jarring. He plays De Niro's brother in ""Raging Bull"", and a protege a generation younger than him in ""Goodfellas"", but here he is his elder! And then I look it up and Pesci is actually De Niro's age! So, leaving all of that aside, you get the great performances you'd expect, and the intimate viewpoint and story will hold your interest through the long running time. It is just very similar to Goodfellas in technique, and that is not a bad thing except it seemed like I had seen this film before.The one unique thing about it? You get to see these mobsters as they get to very old age and have a chance to reflect and maybe have some regrets. In Goodfellas, the main character is in his late 30s when circumstances force him out of the mob.I'd recommend it if you have ever liked anything that the actors or that Scorsese have done before."
288," Great acting - boring movie!
","I couldn't help thinking throughout this film ""What is the point?"" It just rambles its way slowly through and doesn't inform, entertain or add to every other mob movie made."
289," Amazing movies
",The quality of movie is so good it's take me back to the 70s and 90s i miss old days it was great time
290," Dinero needs to retire
",His fat bloated self just really could not pull it off. Boring movie don't waste your time
291," Good but too long
","I enjoyed the film, great to see some of the old faces back on the screen together, I just feel the film is probably 30-45 minutes longer than it really needs to be"
292," Boring & Too Long
",When De Niro Plays a Kid but looks like 40 years old LOL not to mention a lack of irish accent !
293," Could have been better
",75 year old actors no matter how good they are can't play 25 year old characters. Otherwise a great movie
294," Certainly Not Goodfellas or The Departed
","I watched ""The Irishman"" recently. Not only is this movie, by Martin Scorsese, probably not true, but it was so un-Scorsese like. it was very dull, boring, and quite long. Totally opposite of how great the movie Goodfellas or The Departed was. Robert de Niro, and Joe Pesci did very uninspiring portrayals of their characters. And Al Pacino was terrible as his portrayal of Jimmy Hoffa. The actor Stephen Graham, who played Tony Provenzano, would have made a much better Hoffa. Initially, this movie is garnering a 8.5 on IMDb. I'm sure this rating will go down closer to a seven as the years go by. Again, this movie was nowhere near how awesome Goodfellas and The Departed were."
295," Remember the end of Goodfellas/Wolf of Wall St
","Where the fun comes to a complete HALT, and everyone starts getting busted and paranoid and it just kind of feels wrong. Thats the last 2 hours (out of 3 1/2) of this movie. The first half is this historical epic about friendship and conflict, then after a certain celebratory dinner the movie just takes a nosedive into modern Clint Eastwood levels of old man sloth time. Call it what you want ""meditative, reflective"" but holy baloney that 2 hour ending is just so boring, and exposes Deniro's underwritten character. For a 3 and a half hour movie your lead needs to be strong, but Deniro lacks any opinion the entire film. After everything I need a rewatch but given its runtime i dont see that happening for a while."
296," THE OVERBLOWN
","I like movies with this theme. Crime, mafia, illusions of power, gang-wars and the lessons learned when reviewing this life-style. It entertains because the vast majority of people at large do not actually act like this or do the things as depicted and the rest of society is drawn into seeing it rather than ever doing it. The Godfather broke some good ground as did Goodfellas, Casino and Kill the Irishman and some of the oldies prior like Al Capone with Rod Steiger, The Untouchables and even the Black Hand or Pay or Die with so many others too. They all follow the same theme of bad guys getting away with what they do, the rise and fall of power, what that money, fame and power buys and how those that live this life all end up i.e. dead. Now saying all that, the hype with this film was/is the stars who have established themselves with the Director and with that a marketing blitz took-off. As presented, who can find fault? What remained is to watch the movie and be entertained. However, seeing old actors trying to capture past successes only goes so far and Scorsese did not break any new ground here either. What we have is seeing the same old Pacino, Pepsi and De Niro replicating what worked for them but it is old, tired and all covered by now. One system that I use to judge movies on that many fail is this: Is this a movie you would see again? Does it have memorable scenes? Is it a comeback experience? The fact is either it is this type of movie or it is not. Once you have seen this movie assuming you didn't get bored you will not visit it again. I don't like it when things are presented larger than life (hype) and then I go in believing this and get let down. This is that case too. All concerned got very well-paid upfront and now they want to capture the costs and then some proving it was a fun and profitable romp at the viewers expense? There are many ways to kill time this be one of them. It is not bad nor very good"
297," A disappointment!
","8.7 in rating ?? Have you really seen Goodfellas & Casino? The disappearance of Jimmy Hoffa has been a mystery for many years. Masterpiece? I have followed and watched Martin Scorsese's films for many years and this is not a ""masterpiece"". I would like to say that this movie and story land at a maximum 5 stars in rating. Good actor but you made a very interesting and exciting story into something less captivating to watch instead. Why didn't you hire more actors from Sopranos? Goodfellas? Casino? Hoffa? Donnie Brasco? Boardwalk Empire? Do you just want to make money only?"
298," The Irishman
","A great movie that was directed by Martin Scorsese and excelled in acting Robert De Niro, Al Pacino and Joe Pesci. I came out of the film in my head that life will eat everyone. One of the best gangster films. Not winning an Oscar is a crime against the film. I hope Netflix movies are of the same level The Irishman"
299," THE BEST MOVIE OF THE DECADE
","Martin Scorsese proves once again why he is one of the greatest filmmaker of all time.
From start till the end the movie is brilliant, slower than usual Scorsese flicks, but brilliantly done. The editing of the movie is terrific and it will never bore, it movies at a slow pace, its poetic and story is just outstanding.
Al Pacino was the standout performance for me, he gave a mind blowing performance, probably the best performance of the year.
Joe Pesci was unbelievably good, especially considering Goodfellas, Casino and Raging Bull, he was really different.
Robert De Niro was mesmerizing, just outstanding, especially in the last 30 minutes he was insane.
The movie movie had one of the most impactful last 30 minutes, emotional and makes one question about their life.
10/10 The last of its kind Masterpiece, cinema at its finest."
300," The Resurrection of Classic Cinema.
","In the year 2000, Martin Scorsese appeared alongside Roger Ebert to discuss his picks for the top ten best movies of the 1990s. At number four, Scorsese chose Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece, Eyes Wide Shut. He said of it, ""I cherish the film because it puts you in the authoritative hands of an old master, with a style that flies in the face of every modern convention."" Those words hold truth. It seems the very best movies are the auteur pictures. The ones with a guiding hand that shakes you in your seat, directs you through the story, and pummels you with images of power and grace. And that is how I would describe Scorsese's own film, 2019's The Irishman. This sprawling mob epic/ intimate character examination/ eulogy to a lost film era, is a gift. Through all three and a half hours of The Irishman, I was awash in a kind of deep gratitude. I had the surreal sensation of witnessing an all-time classic reveal itself before my eyes. It was like discovering The Godfather in 1972 or Goodfellas in 1990. I felt the warm truth the actors brought, and the ultra-confident hands of a filmmaker who may one day be recognized as the greatest artist of the medium. The Irishman is Scorsese's Eyes Wide Shut; a master director 's masterpiece, a towering beacon from another era, somehow, gloriously existing in this one.The most apt descriptor of the Irishman may not be the first thing to come to mind when you look at the pieces involved. For all its small time thugs, cozy interiors, and countless scenes of meetings, phone conversations and casual dinners, The Irishman is an epic. Epics seem to come to Hollywood in waves. For every boom time (1920s, 1960s, 2000s), there are long droughts where nary a single movie is made that can rightfully claim the title. We are in the middle of such a drought. Many movies are overblown and overlong, but none truly epic. The Irishman, which has gotten plenty of ire for its daunting three and half hour runtime, is one of the only true epics if its decade. And not just because of its length. The story of Frank Sheeran (Robert De Niro), a supposed mob hitman and crucial cog in the rise and fall of Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino) seems very much of a piece with Scorsese's other, smaller mob movies, Goodfellas, Casino, and The Departed. Those films teem with energy, but they don't match The Irishman for scope. Here is an adapted screenplay by Steve Zaillian that traces the breadth of the Golden years of American crime and filters it through the eyes of a handful of characters. Following Frank from the end of World War II to the beginning of the 21st century, Zaillian and Scorsese create a story that feels enormous. The script somehow manages to weave together a slew of major world events into Frank's story a la Forrest Gump, but in a way that feels real and inevitable. This movie is huge. Scorsese holds nothing back; no idea, no bit of color, no set piece or character moment. It's all in there. Yes, The Irishman is very long, and it feels long. It should. This is a journey. The film sweeps you along for its entirety. The sumptuous technical craft and storytelling involvement make it next to impossible to tear yourself away from its embrace. You savor every single moment of The Irishman. It's a feast. The canvas is enormous and every inch of it is painted with exquisite detail.The Irishman is cast like a film lover's ultimate fantasy. The epic crime drama is populated with many of the finest character actors working, as well as a few inspired outsiders, and it stars three of the all-time titans of the industry. But fantasy this is not. What's better is not just that this film exists, for real, in our time, but that everyone is at the very top of their games. Robert De Niro as Frank Sheeran roars back into the world of acting after a long hiatus as a human cartoon character. His Sheeran is an extremely tricky challenge for an actor. He is asked to play a man who is a bit of a dolt, but is still racked with unrecognized guilt. It's an internalized performance if ever there was one. DeNiro plays it absolutely right. He doesn't command the screen like we know he can, but instead wisely chooses a weak, almost bashful, but kind of charming naïveté. The heavy lifting comes from the supporting players. Specifically, the two other legends brought back from the cinematic grave, Al Pacino and Joe Pesci. Pacino plays Jimmy Hoffa in a towering performance worthy to stand alongside the very best of his legendary career. His entrance in the film brings a thunderbolt of classic acting energy. If any living actor understands the power of commanding theatricality on screen, it must be Pacino. His Hoffa is a shining example of the tremendous power of acting joie de vivre. The beating heart of The Irishman is, however, Joe Pesci. His very appearance is a shock, having been retired from acting for 20 years, but almost more shocking is his unprecedentedly subtle brilliance as Frank Sheehan's mob mentor, Russell Bufalino. He is far away from the volatile goons on which he made his name. Here Pesci is relaxed, sagely, and world weary. His presence onscreen is awesome in an almost religious sense. It's literally like watching someone rise from the dead, wiser and more ethereal than before.Who knew this was possible? Who knew these legends who seemed to have faded away into history long ago, still had this intensity, this sensitivity, this skill? Maybe they never lost it. How lucky are we, then, to have gotten this showcase script for them to shine in? The Irishman's detractors have hid behind certain ""controversial"" elements, such as the CGI de-aging used to assist the actors in portraying their younger selves, the film's length, or its distribution on Netflix. None of these trivial hang ups negate what Martin Scorsese and his collaborators have done with The Irishman. This is a classic that will hang in the annals of film history. A film to stand alongside The Godfather, Goodfellas, and the other greats of the genre. The simple fact that it exists brings me immense joy. The fact that it is a perfectly crafted piece of art, overflowing with meaning and themes and personal connections to its auteur brings me something else entirely. This is why I watch movies, why I never allow myself to get too discouraged by modern sensibilities. Because the masters are always a spark of inspiration away from returning to glory. Don't lose hope, there is still room for new classics.98/100"
301," Do yourself a major favor and read the book
","If you read I heard you paint houses, then you know this movie sucks. The book was so damn good that you don't even believe the story yet it's still great. That's how good the book was."
302," Loosing the touch...
","I was reminding myself that this is scoresese movie and it would get better but it didn't.
Old De Niroro as a gansters right hand who does fights for him, definitely not convincing. They should have taken another younger actor for portraying young deniro.
Evidently, it looked like big star cast did add to the popularity of movie but didn't quite pull it off when it comes to content."
303," The Irishman
","3/10 - I know my opinion on this one makes kind of an outsider, but I was throughly unimpressed with the bland story, subpar visual effects, and unbearable runtime of this critical darling"
304," Total Mis-casting and Too Long
","Great cast??? Yes. But.....totally mis-cast. This is a vanity project by a director who has cast the three leads who are far too old to be playing the leads, even with anti-ageing film optics. Their is no way De niro and co should have been cast. Realised when Sheeran played by De Niro went to beat up the grocer...a tortoise could have run away from a clunky slow De Niro. Pesci just looked embarressed the whole way through....thinking why am i here. He hasnt acted for 10 years it showed!. Pacino was the best of the three. Sherran in real life was 6 4' De Niro is 5 8', rumours Liam Neeson was considered he should have got the part. In my opinion the film lacks credability purely based on the three leads someone needs to have a word with them they have ruined the film but not saying im too old!! The rest of the supporting cast were excellent especially Stephen Graham. The film is about an hour too long as well, was bored by the end. Everyone has different opinions but this film could have been a classic but instead turned into an unbeliveable vanity project by people who need to let their past of playing hard men go"
305," I'm sorry but I found it super boring.
","I lived at that time and remember it was in the Daily News, Post constantly. Hoffa was a mean nasty, sob, a super thief that stole from hard working men. He is where he belongs, probably in the foot of the Verrazano Bridge with tons of concrete is what I heard back then. He was played way too nicely."
306," The Irish Grandpapa
","Oh man was this disappointing. Either embrace old age or just let it go, old fellers. This film is rather a document on America's denial of aging and emphasis on phallic, immature ego. Deeply saddening."
307," Geriatric Good Fellas
","Very poor, aged men made to look young, but they all move like old men, it's sad and laughable."
308," Oh god - is there still an hour to go?
","Very poor indeed, especially considering all the on-screen (and off-screen!) talent. It's as if they're just going through the motions for old time's sake."
309," Not compelling enough to be worth finishing
","This is a very long film which needed some serious editing. The not particularly interesting story progresses very slowly, we got sick of this after about 2/3 of the film and can't be bothered watching the rest. It is not completely enough to be worth caring about.The film is an indulgence by Scorcese, De Niro et al."
310," AND ON SUNDAY SCORSESE RESTS
","This film is something untouchable, unattainable and is simply Scorsese. Although the film does not broadcast or give anything new, nothing that the spectator is already used to seeing from Scorsese or other directors like Francis Ford Coppola. Is at the end nothing really original, but Irishman does nothing but renew and rediscover that energy, long lost, of crime films that these directors created in their golden ages becoming the piooners of the genre. Irishman is gritty, fun, rude and with a mixture of unique emotions as the pace rumbles down to the end. This movie warns the viewer that one of the strongest bosses out there is Martin Scorsese. At the end, we must praise the grace with which Pacino, Pesci and De Niro act, teaching old and new generations, once again, in this genre and not."
311," Completely overrated
",They say it might be a Netflix commercial since people say the film is great. I can't know if it's a commercial or not but I can say this movie is not that great. The reason I got bored was not about time. It didn't take my interest. I have watced this type of films especially many of Scorsese films. They were so much better..
312," Do not listen to the negative Marvel generation!
",I've you are a real Scorsese fan you definitly like this movie. Look behind the CGI. You can learn a lot about history. De cast is fantastisch. Scroll up and you see the best reviews.
313," Boring and miscast
","De Niro and Pacino together again! Yay! Except, not so much. De Niro is OK, but Pacino is a disaster as Jimmy Hoffa. All I can hear when he speaks is his schlock performance from Scent of a Woman. Sometimes it helps to cast a less culturally ubiquitous actor, so that the character can outshine the performer. The real joy in this slog is Joe Pesci, who is terrific playing a very different kind of person than you're used to with him. So glad he came out of retirement for it. The CGI aging and de-aging is remarkable, but what would have been really good was to cast actors aged appropriately for their younger days, and age them with makeup. Sure, it's not the De Niro/Pacino star power, but it would have been a much better movie.The Irishman is dragged down by stunt casting. And, I predict that it won't help at the box office. There just isn't as much interest anymore in a De Niro/Pacino pairing as there was a quarter-century ago, when Michael Mann snagged them for Heat."
314," Oh hey, ANOTHER gangster movie
","Just when I thought we'd be through with these never-ending Deniro, Scorsese, Pacino, Pesci mob movies, we get one more.It feels like another one of these annual, stupid Diane Keaton attempts to make a movie.Y'all are too old, too trapped in your stale characters, and no longer interesting to watch.
It isn't cute.Deniro plays his only character he's always played, which is tired and worse now that he's so darn old and feeble. Pesci is the same charter as any movie he's done. Pacino as well but he is the most believable via CGI.This ""story"" has been filmed about 50 times.
When is it enough??!
We get it - there were a lot of shady losers in our east coast history.
Dear Hollywood and Scorsese, the rest of America is tired of these stupid NJ/NY gang movies. Find another genre and leave this one to its death, puh-lease."
315," Pacino stole the show
","Everything seems excellent in this movie , but Al Pacino seems superior to everything.
Scorsese did it again I wish Al Pacino made more movies with Scorsese .
Respect for the The Irishman."
316," Rose colored spectacles
",Some movies would be better left unmade this being one of them ! A stellar cast who in their day were the best at their craft but their best days are long gone such a pity that we will remember this poor effort as their swan song ! Bland weak overly long like a stay at grandmas !!!
317," NO RISPETTO
","There is no new trope on a mob story here. It's all telegraphed and predictable.If you're into politics you get a nice historical visual...This very high rating is merely the hagiography of well versed genre characters not too dissimilar from fanboys cheering on another bad film franchise sequel.Nobody should be able to get away with over 3 hours of film making, it shouldn't matter if you have 36 Oscars on the shelf, consumers have been long conditioned by a format of story telling that needs things resolved in half the time. Producers are being as undisciplined and vain as Hoffa by refusing these facts.Drawn out sequences to illustrate the moral tale is tedious. We know that evil doesn't prosper in life and art. We know that young men become old and we know that families are collateral damage which was a fairly unexplored opportunity which writers didn't do well with.Ironic that DeNiro has become a bit of an activist himself later in life, there's nothing more belittling than a privileged actor telling us how to think.One nice observation from the film is how easily trade unions are corrupted from within, all around the western world. They do not have the same checks and balances that state and federal governments have, watching this on the big screen was an educative silver lining."
318," Joe pesci , wow
","My respect for mr. Pesci, other level, Oscar for supporting actor wow"
319," VFX moving on Leaps and Bounds
","Amazing use of the latest tech in this film. Yup you can see it, but still something is brilliant about it.
I really enjoed this movie."
320," Stopped watching after 75 minutes. Very boring
",Very boring. Stopped watching it after 75 minutes. The characters seems like the regular mobster characters only on retirement and sleeping pills
321," Dont miss! a masterpic
","It The movie of the year
and One of the best Martin Scorsese's movie
and one of the greatest mob drama movies of all time"
322," A Scorsese Masterpiece
","This film will have your attention from the opening scene. The fastest 3 and a half hour film I have ever seen. Such an epic film, great story, great cast, and great score."
323," Puke!
",These piece of cow flop is unwatchable as I couldn't stomach it any longer after the first twenty minutes. I am embarrassed for Scorsese for making this travesty!
324," Like picking up a great book you don't want to put down
","I would love to be able to sit back and read more than I watch but I can't so my next best is watching epic and long drawn out story lines in a film.
Always with a little apprehension I put on the Irishman thinking although it has the famous Mob Actors in the line ""will it still work?""
It does and starts with narrative too which is another thing that I like. I found that 3.5 hrs felt like an hour and that's how I measured the films success.
If you don't like it there is always an off button."

0," So bad that I almost walked out of my own house!
","The first one was fun and well played out. This sequel is a total misfire. Not because it follows the trend of having women being the alpha characters and portraying men as either weak or stupid, but simply because it's a lazy effort. Except a couple of scenes, and hilarious over-the-top acting by Pedro Pascal, I found nothing here. It has ""straight-to-DVD"" written all over it."
1," Must have seen a different movie.
","Saw an advanced screening - this was the most excited I've been to see a movie in a very long time. It appears I'm in the minority who found it to be, frankly, terrible. While the performances of the leads were enjoyable, I found the movie's writing and direction so flawed as to be practically unwatchable.Gadot continues to embody WW laudably, if leaning at times toward overacting. Pine is effective as the ""fish out of water"" launched several decades into the future, even if some of his comedic moments with Gadot fall flat. Pascal plays a classically over-the-top 80's villain with enthusiasm - it seems he relishes every moment getting to play a bad guy. For me, Wiig gave the strongest performance of the first act - her comedic timing is given plenty of time to shine, and the audience has ample opportunity to empathize with her. Unfortunately, these four performances were not enough to dig this film out of the hole the writers created.Written with an over-inflated sense of self-importance, riddled with clunky dialogue trying desperately to convey depth and universal truths, the end result is an endless stream of cringeworthy, eye roll inducing lines that are so on the nose I wonder how they made it out of the writing room. At no point does the film treat its audience with intelligence, opting instead to spoon-feed every concept. How do they convey that WW is not only an action hero, but an advocate for the humanity in all of us? By forcing her to deliver gems like ""But Barbara, what about your warmth? What about your humanity?""Further issues, presented as they occur to me as I tire of reflecting on this mess:Why is the heist scene so intentionally campy? The movie is *set* in '84, not *made* in '84. Fortunately the remainder of the film abandons this style.Their *most* creative way to sell Barbara as awkward but likable is to have her drop her briefcase of papers? Couldn't come up with something original?All Smithsonian employees have access to an unguarded airfield? A WWII pilot can understand the controls?No fully-fueled fighter jet has a range to fly DC to Cairo.WW has only ever vanished a coffee mug in all her trying, but can suddenly vanish the jet ""because she must"".""I know we're racing against time to save the world, but let's go fly through some fireworks. It'll look cool, promise.""One moment WW can effortlessly sprint pushing a disabled armored vehicle down the road, the next she can't push two of them apart with all her might.The moment she rolls along the road with the two children in her arms is astonishingly poor CGI. Throughout the film, the most obviously CGI'd elements simply have no weight to them.Don't play the audio of Steve's ""how to fly"" speech over the moment WW takes it to heart and learns. Trust your actors and audience. Show, don't tell.Max didn't think to steal health in return for wishes until the end of the third act?Cheetah has practically zero screen time to pose a real threat. One fight and she's dealt with handily.Hundreds of nukes launched, and they don't vanish - they crumble in mid-air. This is somehow not a problem for the planet?Returned to the white house grounds, Max somehow lands within yards of his son who has been wandering abandoned highways?Linda Carter's cameo was *painful*. If she didn't actually smile and wink into the camera, it sure as hell felt like she did. I won't be re-watching to find out for sure.I'm tired of griping. I wanted so badly to like this continuation of the DCEU. I'll be there for the next one hoping for better, but my god was this a disappointment. I saw the movie for free and the cost was still too high."
2," Horrendous
","First off, I loved the first movie and was looking forward to the sequel. That being said, this was a disappointing convoluted mess. It's like a train wreck and a dumpster fire had a baby, then the baby puked and that puke became this movie. Seriously, what were they thinking with this script? So many talented actors and so much wasted potential.So, because the script says so, Diana can make things disappear at will? She can swing from lighting with her lariat? She can block and catch bullets with her lariat? She can attach and swing from airplanes that are at cruising altitude while she's on the ground?! All of these exaggerated abilities while she's supposedly losing her powers? Another thing, her suit was supposed to be powerful, yet it crumbled like tinfoil during her five minute fight with Cheetah. What was the point of her wearing it then if she was back at full strength?Max Lord's character was laughable. The stone wasn't crumbling with every wish, so why was he getting sick after granting wishes even though he became the stone? None of this lunacy made any sense whatsoever.This movie was so bad that I walked out of my own house. Seriously, skip this and watch the first movie."
3," Makes Justice League and Suicide Squad look Oscar worthy
",I have low expectations for DC movies. Some have delightfully surprised me. This falls flat on its face after 15-20 mins and never gets up...or even TRIES!! It felt rushed through production (definitely not in watch speed...). It was boring when their wasn't action and when the action started it was so fake it was distracting. Gadot and Pascal try and maybe have moments that don't suck. Wiig was...well exactly how you would expect her in an action film as a villain.To say the movie is disappointing is an understatement which is sad considering I had zero expectations going into it. Glad it was streaming so I didn't have to waste money on a movie ticket.
4," Utter disappointment
",I've been eagerly waiting for this. I made a great lunch of Christmas Eve leftovers and sat down - ready for a great movie.This movie is utterly ridiculous. From the moment it starts it comes off almost as a parody. The open scene is very childish. Way too on the nose with its moralistic foreshadowing. The following failed heist is equally juvenile - taking place in a mall and is just plain silly. It's far from the grittier atmosphere that DC has been so good at recently.The interpretation of 80's culture is completely distracting and strips away any gravitas. Pedro Pascal comes off as laughable and inane. Wiig fairs no better and cannot pull off the baddie.It was hard to watch. I had hopes for DC but this one is a complete dud.
5," Sorry Patty, you tanked!
","I agree with the review ""utter disappointment"", I also read the Washington Post article. "" really getting to do whatever I wanted"" she said. And what a sad commentary that turned out to be. All of her characters, props and settings were ridiculous. Kristen Wiig injects one of her babbling SNL characters in her first scene. A super villian she's not, even for comic relief. And where is the strong empowered woman that encourages other women to use their own powers? Then there is that magic lasso, Diana might just as well sat and her desk in the museum and flicked it to and fro since it appeared to have an infinite length this time around. Placing the film in her memories of the '80s this might work for Coppola or Scorsese but one's sense of history needs to be able to look further into the past to develop a view. Was that President supposed to be Reagan, surely you could have found someone who actually resembled him. So much for '80s memories. The scenes of an injured and defeated WW were way to drawn out, and the computers of the day were only beginning to go beyond pixelated pictures. The technology of the day would not have been able to broadcast to the world. And Gal Gadots talents were never realized she just wasn't involved enough beyond window dressing, more attention was spent on the sets and locations. And what disappointment the release streaming and theatre distribution. Although I love theaters (I spent 35 yrsin the movie business) where I live they haven't reopened yet. THe streaming was terrible stop, stutter, freeze. fortunately the movie was so bad the pauses were a relief. I wonder what Bill Diehl or Roger Ebert would have had to say about WW84? I'm glad I watched the credits, I couldn't believe how many people were listed. But then Lynda Carter made an appearance. 15 seconds of Joy out of 2 and 1/2 hours."
6," Just read the other review. All true!
","Why is Warner Brothers hell bent on destroying a potential gold mine, that is the DC franchise. I thought they had finally sorted it with WW and Aquaman. But no, normality resumes. This movie was terrible at everything. Story, dialogue, acting, cgi. Just sell the franchise to another studio and give us DC fans a break"
7," From hero to zero in just two WW movies
","The 1st WW film was absolutely brilliant and had more ticks than a farmer's dog in my book. WW84 is, which truly saddens and maddens me, the polar opposite. It has a script so weak it should be classed as highly vulnerable, a plot that has more holes than my kitchen colander, and characters about as believable as a career politician.
I did love the opening island scene where the girl actress playing the young Diana was superb, and apparently did all her non-cgi stunts. But then it went downhill faster than an illiterate skier passing a 'Warning - cliff ahead' sign.
I won't go into detail over WW84s failings as I have a bus to catch...in a week, but I think I can reveal my favourite, jaw-dropping line from the film without it being a spoiler...'... I want to be an apex predator!'It certainly made me growl."
8," Rubbish film.
","Too long, too slow. Quite uninteresting. An absolute ton of plot holes. DC destroy another movie. Did Gal Gadot forget how to act? Don't waste your time."
9," Gal Gadot As ""Producer"": LMFAO
","This movie was so bad I can't put into words.Not just sequel bad. Bad. I love action and fantasy, but this sequel is so bad I can no longer watch the original.Music over the top. Acting non-existent/ Length felt like 6 hours and not in a good way.Don't understand people raving about it (Gal's agent?). They must be connected to the film somehow (I see they are throwing the director rightly under the bus).Save your money, watch the original seriesand don't let this ruin it for you like it did for me2 stars for the actress legs and hair."
10," Actionhero movie with almost no action
","Writer, producer and director Patty Jenkins really did a give this movie a feminine/soap opera touch and by doing so destroyed everything that this movie could have been. The first WW movie was not that great, but Patty did not write that one, this sequel she did and it is worthless. I was wondering if I was watching a drama or a action hero franchise. First the movie is far to long, the dialogue's are pointless and boring, you can skip with ease them because the story is not that complicated. For the action, the effects are good, not worth the time to watch, but still well made, but there are not very much action scenes. If you look at the demographic of the votes you can see girls <18 years are the only ones who love this movie, and that should have been the warning that should have been given with this movie: only see this movie if you are a teenage girl."
11," Cats is a better movie
","Gal gadot can not act. Full Stop. The script was atrocious, nothing flowed. Best parts of the movie is are the supporting cast. And the best 1 minute of this movie was the after credits scene.
DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME."
12," Oh when will this end....
","First 15 minutes was the best, and literally did not contribute to the story... not one bit.Ok where to begin...:
Lasso of truth? More like infinity flying power bulletproof magic LassoMain villian is a genie in a rockStoryline is people wishing from said genieMost climatic fight scene is in the trailer.... seriously.. its wonder woman fighting a leopard/ tiger thingy....Main villian is defeated by saying 4 wordsNo emotional connection to characters, shallow and uninspiring. (literally if anyone died, you just wouldnt care.)no consequence after saying those 4 words. things magically became normalI dont get how is this even rated past a 5. Critics rating it 9?!?! Really suspicious. Must be some market manipulation.I literally created an account just to write this... Dont watch this pls. I wasted my time and money, hope you dont make the same mistake."
13," This is the worst movie I watched this year!
","In fact if I would have watched this movie on January 1st, 2021 it would have been the worst movie in 2021. It is right up there next to Cats."
14," I Have An Idea For The Third One *
","Wonder Woman 3: (dadaa) Wonder Woman vs. Cat Woman!!!!!!!!It sounds terrible, but cannot be any worse than this stupid trash. Wooden acting, uninteresting story, and no super powers just magic because everything is perfect and the gadgets make Wonder Woman invincible...*Because Hollywood is a junkie and must make endless sequels contractually, immorally, stupidly, etc."
15," Awful
",Most of the budget went to the Gadot and her makeup. Special effects at the level of the 2000s. The plot is just terrible. This is the final of Gadot's career.
16," Not what I expected
","Very long winded and quite soppy, I found myself getting quite bored. I m not really sure what this movie is trying to be, a drama love story maybe with a few action scenes. Disappointed."
17," In quarantine, you'll buy anything.
","Very colorful, lots of money spent. Kristin Wiig was a masterpiece of miscasting. She wasn't funny; she wasn't scary, but great costume. The whole plot was a vehicle to resurrect Chris Pine, but there was no real chemistry between them. It made the lines of endearment quite awkward and the embraces seemed forced. All the usual tropes: WW loses some of her powers, so there can be suspense; she plays Spiderman and holds two vehicles apart. Just nothing new and Gad Gadot proves again that she's a glamour model and poses well. She can't act. Still - entertainment in a vacuum of good movies, so watch it and be distracted for TWO AND A HALF hours."
18," Terrible!
","Really, really bad. Dumb plot executed over an excruciatingly long and boring 2.5 hours. Acting was fine but story, flow, and execution was really terrible. Worst superhero movie I have seen in a long time."
19," Lack of acting by gal galot
",Gal galot dint impressed a bit.not was expected.. direction was good.
20," Don't waste you time
",Avoid at all cost. The storyline is absolutely garbage. The whole cast should be recast. DC continues to disappoint.
21," Sequel
","I don't know what's in it for the people giving good reviews. This is trash. Boring, senseless and most importantly amateur acting. Don't waste your time."
22," Patty Jenkins Sets Women Back w/ This Rubbish
","The first WW movie was amazing! It clearly demonstrated that a woman super hero can be strong, smart, funny and, most of all, can easily hold her own with her male counterparts. It was a monumental step forward for super hero movies and women in general and I couldn't wait for the sequel. It was very disappointing to see the direction Mrs. Jenkins took this character. The WW in this movie represents and displays all of the stereotypical cliches so many serious actresses have worked for years to dispel. In the first WW she was a badass who fought with passion against evil and stood up for her convictions. In WW84, when she's not pining for her lost love (because we all know a woman is lost without her man, right?) she's winking at little kids while she fights campy bad guys who are literally tripping over themselves to get caught. The female supporting cast isn't much better. Kristen Wiig is the embodiment of the frazzled, clingy stereotype that went out of style in most movies years ago. The only 2 strong women (Connie Nielsen amd Robin Wright) are gone after the first 10 minutes and we are left with weak, campy garbage. The WW in the first film was Christian Bale's Batman. In WW84 we get the Adam West Batman. Such a disappointment."
23," Vastly Disappointing
","The first movie was great.I wonder why Gadot agreed to do this one. I really wonder why with all the good things DC have been doing recently, they chose to do this to the franchise.The film had a very few moments of grace, but then just let them all go. If you're keen to watch it, wait for one of the streaming services to pick it up."
24," One of the worst superhero movies I have ever watched.
","I can't believe this movie was released, its like they don't care about making a good movie."
25," Patty Jenkins should be fired. Never let Gal Gadot 'produce' again...
","What in the giving world was this? Absolutely horrible. Two villans, terrible storylines, lackluster sparkle, zero development charm seen in the first film, 4th grade level special effects... Terrible. Whomever gave Gal the authority to 'produce' this should be fired. I expect Patty Jenkins to receive a due tongue lashing for this 2020 mess of a mish-mash. Talk about setting back the female Superhero adrenaline train...I'm at a loss here, literally. I feel like this disaster of a DC movie rivals the 4th iteration of 'Hulk', just constant senseless, numbing devalued, uninspiring ridiculous visuals. Gal brought grace to the first one; empirical music clashing with slow motion videography and power through speed and her wrists. This one... GMAB.Poor Chris Pine, I hear he's willing to take another potential celebrity bashing for WWIII too..."
26," Long and Boring .
","PROS
The Cinematography is top notch .The Score is good .The chemistry between Gal and Chris was enjoyable .CONS
Gal was at her worst . she did a decent job in the previous installement but this time she was way off the mark .I love Chris Pine . He is an underrated actor and i enjoyed his previous movies but his comic timing in this movie fell flat .The villains are cartoonish .They didn't get a good screen time to performe well but i can't blame them coz the writing sucks big time .The CGI looks Really Bad .The dialogues were cringe-worthy .The action scenes were barely entertaining .All in All . One of the worst sequels i heve ever seen and it's poorly written and directed . Save your precious time and watch the first wonder woman is more entertaining and fun to watch ."
27," Only Gal Gadot's Agent And Mom Are Upvoting This
","Otherwise 5.5 For This?? Should be 2/10.Completely over-rated!This is a bad film! I was disappointed at how boring this film actually is. Just enough references and nods to actual Wonder Woman films but does not stand up in its own right. The soundtrack littered with farts and shrieks at the worst moments. Gadot (Miss 'producer') was terrible as Wonder woman (I don't even think she thought she is in a Wonder woman movie), completely useless unless you are imagining nailing her. Give it up."
28," Audiences: No One Can Make A Movie As Bad As Cat Woman...
",... Gal Gadot And Patty Jenkins: Hold our beers.This is what happens when people who are not comic book/superhero/action fans become in charge of making comic book/superhero/action movies.
29," worst dceu movie
","Worst ever super hero movie
gal gadot cannot act
gal gadot cannot sing"
30," Wonder Woman 1984 is... A Wasted Concept.
","This is gonna be a long one... here we go...First, I'd like to dissect every character one by one, starting with Diana.
I'll get right to it: she's boring. Seriously, she's awful. Gal Gadot makes a great Wonder Woman visually, but her performance lacks a lot. She's just not fun to watch. She has cool scenes and stunts, but she doesn't look like she's having fun. While the film has its serious moments, it does have the sort of wild epic-ness that warrants a more excited heroine.
Even when the script tries to make her ""have fun,"" she just can't. I understand that Wonder Woman is supposed to be a more elegant character in general, but something about Gadot's acting just makes everything fall flat. I don't enjoy seeing her be awesome, because she's not enjoying it either. She's going through the motions of being cool, and just comes off like a depressed and generic good guy.
Aside from her personality, the position they've put Diana in doesn't make sense.
I refuse to believe that Diana hasn't changed her name in 60+ years. Wonder Woman is perhaps the most invaluable superhero; she is quite literally a ""god killer."" One can only imagine that there are many other gods, goddesses, and immortal beings who would want her dead.
I was honestly expecting us to find Diana living off the grid in a low-rent apartment, moving around and working odd jobs to make ends meet (when she wasn't stopping petty crime, of course). But no, we get a rich, high society Diana who works at a museum, flaunting her inhuman knowledge and qualities - basically a sitting duck for her enemies.
But enough about her.Next, we have Steve... oh Steve... you're just the worst. Now, Steve doesn't do anything wrong - he's simply dull as a blank wall. He adds nothing to the story - well, his presence does, but not him as a character. He's expendable; you could swap him out with anyone else and the effect would be the same. Also, Chris Pine has absolutely no chemistry with Gadot; he was clearly only cast because he's considered eye candy for the ladies.Now for the villains... this is where it gets interesting... the bad guys are way better than the heroes. As I said above, Steve and Diana are painfully boring and blank. However, this movie has some of the best villains I've seen in a recent superhero film.Max Lord, played by Pedro Pascal, absorbs the power of an artifact called the Dreamstone, which gives him the ability to grant wishes. However, he also takes something from whoever had their desire granted. Obviously, this goes horribly wrong, and eventually the world descends into chaos. Max (who is loosely inspired by J.R. Ewing from Dallas; change my mind) is a surprisingly engaging character. The actor did a good job portraying him; I know he sounds boring but he stole the show every time he was on screen.Finally, we have Barbara, aka Cheetah. Her story starts a bit slowly, even invoking the age-old trope of a stereotypically dorky girl who becomes confident. But Kristen Wiig actually gives the character enough charisma that she is more likable than Diana. This is what I talked about earlier. Once Barbara becomes Cheetah, she is the kind of character Diana should've been.
She's cool and fun to watch, she looks like she's enjoying the battle, she has spirit - even though she was supposed to be evil, I actually enjoyed seeing her beat up Diana!
Yeah, I know that sounds awful, but this brings me to my final point: what I liked most about this movie was the film's biggest flaw.If I'm rooting for the villains, that means the heroes sucked (which they did). Don't get me wrong, bad guys need to be interesting in a story, but the heroes also need to be charismatic and awesome. I wanted to see Barbara succeed, and once she did, she seemingly surpassed Diana's level. Therefore, it was easier to dislike Diana.Now, onto my final complaint: why on earth was this set in the 80's? Both the title and the marketing for this movie made it seem like it was no mistake that it took place in 1984. Clearly it was for nostalgic purposes, but that's just it... there's no nostalgia. This could've been set in literally any other decade and been the same.
Now, I'm not saying it needed to be heavy-handed, playing cliche and overused songs every five seconds, but there is absolutely nothing in this movie that utilizes its setting. There is one opening scene that takes place in a mall, but it's entirely pointless and could be cut out of the movie.
There were just so many opportunities to make Wonder Woman even cooler with this, like playing rock/synth music while she fights or having her duke it out with Cheetah in a theater while 'The Terminator' is on the screen. But there is nothing of the sort.
Now, this wouldn't be so much of a problem if the year 1984 wasn't such a big part of the plug. If it was just called 'Wonder Woman II' in regular font, who cares. But when you call it 'WONDER WOMAN: 1984' with retro colors and title style, the audience expects more clever nods to the decade.I suppose I've went on and griped enough; in short it's an okay movie but it could've been a lot better. I like some of what they did, but the rest certainly isn't what I would've done with it."
31," The arrogance it takes for these people to release this publicly!!!
","JUST SAY NOReally bad script coupled with really bad actors and actresses in a really bad and low budget soap opera film.Shame. Wonder Woman (RIP) deserved better.
Watch Batman or Spiderman instead."
32," Time For An Audit
","They need to unleash the auditors on this producer and film because, according to IMDB, this film had a budget of $200 million and yet this was the result.If that budget is fact I know Pentagon contractors and consultants who take better care of funds than this lot.Moreover, it was too much, whatever they paid the actors and actresses. None of them can act, which is the point. The director must have chosen them as such because look at her level of 'talent.'I am off scraping the cheese off my ceiling thanks to this Telemundo soap."
33," What a joke, a really bad joke.
","Fifteen minutes into the movie and I've writing this review while I'm watching the movie because I know I won't miss anything. Even the 70's WW series with Linda Carter was less campy than this movie. It's too bad, I really enjoyed the first Wonder Woman. As a matter of fact, I think stop watching this and go rent the 70's WW series. You should too."
34," Come on DC! What was that?!
",Don't waste your money. My family sat down tonight all very excited to watch. No more than me. All three of my children got up and walked away from the movie within first hour and my wife had a nap. I was determined to see it through. Pretty upset I wasted $30 on this.
35," Green Lantern is relieved
",That it's no longer the worst modern superhero film. Superman IV: Quest for Peace...you can also take a cleansing breath.
36," Don't believe the negative reviews - it's worse
","Horrible. Just horrible. A tedious, long and incoherent film. Story barely made sense and after 30 mins I simply didn't care. Stuck with it to see if it got any better. Amazingly it got worse.She wishes for Steve to come back and he's in a different body - some wish.
Steve, a pilot from WW1 knows how to fly a modern fighter jet.
And drive a modern car. A basic Peugeot that turns out to be bullet proof.
And he knows how to fire a bazooka.
Maybe should call the film Wonder Guy.Even Green Lantern is better than this film."
37," Maybe don't put the best stuff in the trailer?....
","I've never written a review on here before but this film disappointed me for one major reason, if you watched the trailer you have seen most of the good stuff.The first film was awesome, this one had the potential to be great too but the trailer took away all suspense for me.First of all, there was no reason for Chris Pine to get top billing in this movie. Him showing up after Diana wished for him to be alive would have been a nice surprise.Second, the trailer should not have shown Cheetah as the villain. Barbara was a friend of Diana's for the majority of the movie, she didn't become villainous until more than halfway through the movie. Before you say that it can't be done, look at what Marvel did with Mysterio in Spider Man Far From Home. People had guessed he was the villain but nobody actually knew for sure, because Marvel was smart enough to keep that from us. I found myself just waiting for Barbara to turn bad because I knew it was coming, based on the trailer.Pedro Pascal and Kristen Wiig were great additions and played their roles very well, the chemistry between Gal & Pine remains great, but I can't get past the trailer revealing all of the good stuff when there was no need for it."
38," It's pretty awful.
","I definitely think it deserves more than 1 star, but it doesn't come close to living up to the hype or the hope for a great movie. Beginning is fun when she competes as a little girl and feels like groundwork for the coming story, but then the rest of the movie has nothing to do with the beginning. The mall scene at the beginning is really, really awful! The other fight scenes are just okay but not terrible. The story is pretty bad, but there are far worse. I've never been a fan of the ""superhero loses their powers"" plot line. Steve coming back in someone else's body is super weird. You want him back somehow, but not like that. Cheetah is an interesting idea but they didn't utilize her like they could have. I was expecting an epic matchup between she and Wonder Woman at the end. Not there. If you blink you will miss it. It's just an okay hero movie. It's not great, but better than 1 star."
39," Well well
",For me this was unwatchable really good actors who let the director turn this franchise into a joke
40," Un-Wonder Woman
","This has to be one of the worst movies of 2020. I waited patiently for this film to release and I was dismayed by what I saw. The action is dull, the acting is wooden and dialogue sounds like it was written by a first time writer. If you love cliches this is your movie. It's filled with them and you just have to roll your eyes. Superman v. Batman is far more superior than this film. Director Patty Jenkins really dropped the ball. The first film was so much better. What blows my mind is that the movie was directed by the same person who directed the first one. I think it was the right decision to split the release between digital and theatrical because it was not going to make its profit back just by doing a theatrical release, let alone on demand. I don't recommend this movie. I'd advise you wait until it's free on tv in about a year. It's that bad. It pains me to be so critical of Wonder Woman because I'm a huge fan. However, I'm not a fan of a director who can't even make a decent sequel. This is the same director who is going to direct Star Wars Rouge Squadron in 2023. If you love Gal Gadot check this movie out, other then that this is a hard pass."
41," Wonder Woman 1984: The Quest For Peace. Awful.
","The sequel to Wonder Woman was rescheduled time and time again because of the emergence of COVID-19 and cinemas being off limits. It's finally been released however but can also be streamed on HBO Max which has made some to say that cinemas may be a thing of the past.So is this sequel as good as it's amazing first film?The film opens with Diana reminiscing to when she was a child and taking part in an Olympics style event in which she excels until she is felled by a tree branch which makes her fall from the horse that carries her but then decides to cheat to try and take the lead. She is found out to have cheated however and whilst she is heartbroken at not having won she is told that her time will come. This opening is in keeping with the first film and is fantastic.But as the film then flashes forward into 1984 it starts to come seriously unstuck. It's easy for films to fall into a kind of exaggerated, unrealistic and truly irritating parody of a decade especially one that is larger than life like the 1980's. The film falls headlong into this trap and so the 80's we see is wall to wall bad fashions, people eating fatty foods in abundance and littering. It feels fake and manufactured. If there was a hashtag that could be used here for the Twitterati it would be #notmy80s. 'Ah but this is the vision of the 80's that is individual to this film and Patty Jenkins' I hear the comic fanboys screaming. Then in that case it just plain sucks.There then comes an action sequence in a shopping mall in which WW foils a robbery. It's so pointless and pathetic that I actually shouted out in the cinema 'This is awful!' I even for a nanosecond thought of walking out. This would have set a new record for the fastest time I've walked out of a film, having lasted only ten minutes watching Freddy Vs Jason.Fortunately the film calms down on the over the top 80's schtick as we see the main narrative for the film- an artefact known as the dreamstone which can fulfil the wish of those who touch it but with a catch. For every wish, the person loses something else dear to them. When I heard of this premise for the film it seemed fine. But as is stated by characters within the film, this is actually based on the urban legend of the 'Monkey's Paw'. When I found this out (and by characters in the actual film!) the premise disintegrated right before my eyes. I felt robbed and the whole premise for the film felt lazy. In fact, very quickly in the film I found myself thinking 'I really don't care what happens to ANY character in this film'. Nothing in the film's runtime swayed me from this.Diana wishes for Steve Trevor to come back and hence this is how we get Chris Pine back in the sequel. However, with this wish coming true we see WW start to lose her powers. The scene where we see him reappear should have had a massive emotional pull for the audience. There was nothing. This film is just like it's depiction of the decade it takes place in- all surface, no depth.We are introduced to the socially awkward Barbara Minerva who wishes to be just like Diana. She gains her wish. She later wishes to be an 'apex predator'. Again, she gets her wish and transforms into supervillianess Cheetah. The first glimpse of Cheetah was so naff I actually burst out laughing.We also get another baddie in the form of 'orange man bad' Max Lord who is based on Donald Trump. Theres even a border wall in the film. Hmmm. The President of the United States in the film is obviously based on Ronald Reagan. There are even allusions to his Alzheimers with him saying that felt completely disorientated and 'somewhere else' during one scene. Or maybe with such as admission he's based on Joe Biden instead.The real problem for me throughout the film are the scenes that involve Wonder Woman which is massively problematic based around her character. The action scenes contain the worst examples of CGI I've seen in a long long time. There are times when Wonder Woman feels more like an action figure in a really badly conceived computer game from the early 00's.There is also a scene in which we are introduced to a new power that Diana unveils. She can turn objects invisible by simply touching them. This made me roll my eyes when I had already rolled them far too many times already. 'Maybe she can also make this film half it's running time' I found myself thinking.Another scene that had me rolling my eyes was when Barbara decides to go to the gym when she discovers she has superstrength and decides to lift weights. There is also another cringy scene when she bumps into the creepy guy who harassed her earlier in the film.But there are scenes that work. When Diana finds out she can fly it's through a statement Steve has made earlier in the film about his love of flying. These scenes are beautiful to behold and don't involve dodgy CGI. This scene works amazingly well. If only the care and attention that had gone into this scene could have been applied to the rest of the film the whole movie would be more of a rewarding experience.I enjoyed the scenes of Max's health getting worse with every wish he bestows. This could have been exploited more with him disintegrating more radically throughout the film a la the undead character in An American Werewolf In London. But I appreciate that that might not have been appropriate in a film aimed primarily at children.When Diana has to say goodbye to Steve so that she can get her powers back, again, there should have been more emotional resonance for the audience. Again, there wasn't any.In fact when I heard that Diana was to lose her powers to get Steve back I instantly thought of Superman 2 with Superman willingly renouncing his superpowers so he can enter a relationship with Lois. But whilst I was hoping for a sequel as good as Superman 2 for Wonder Woman instead we got Superman 4: The Quest For Peace resplendent with a naff call for world peace in a nuclear free world.After the first film I would have wished for a sequel. After seeing Wonder Woman 84, I renounce my wish."
42," Wow they let this director work on Star Wars?
","Didn't they learn from Rian johnson's fiasco??
WW 1984 is one of the worst movie I have ever seen. Don't waste your time and watch it. It's is very bad. Not worth to turn on the television. Gal Gadot should just take it off."
43," Horrendous

46," Failed sequel
","The first WW was a decent movie, the second installment is not.
The plot is basic, and has been done before. The setting is 1984, we get it, but really has no bearing on the story, at all. However, the movie sure made sure to show plenty of pastel colors and popped collars, because you know, the 80s.
The CGI is really bad in some places, and the action sequences are also stale and boring. This film does nothing to set up any future stories within the DCEU, or really shed any light on WW, other than the opening scene showing her as a child.
The worst part of all has to be the ending. Max Lord has to touch people to grant wishes, but at the end all he has to do is appear on TV? What!? Also, to break the wishes he granted, all a person has to do is renounce the wish. So in the end, WW really isn't needed at all."
47," Can't believe some people like this movie.
","Horrible plot, action, CGI, characters, etc. Enjoyed the first one, but this sequel was as bad as they come. Honestly, I can't believe the writers, director or actors didn't just say STOP and walk away from this when they must have realized what a mess it was going to be. Yikes."
48," What a way to destroy a good franchise

","I was looking forward to seeing this, but I was more than disappointed. The script of this movie is the most atrocious thing I have ever seen. I will briefly review the storyline so that spoilers are not present.Opening scene: (shown in ads, so not a spoiler) Wonder Woman's early years in a competition. Completely unrealistic that she is beating adult women in an olympic thing complete with horse racing and parkour. Then it turns into a goofy moral filled ending of the competition. You are wanting more of her early life story, but then it skips right to adulthood.The problem with the rest of the movie is that it has ridiculous amounts of filler. It will spend 10 minutes straight acting as if the main pot line is not there. Stupid things like the mall scene, attacker scene, love story scene, etc. It is like lots of small cut scene movies chopped together. Then you got Pedro Pascal doing the main plot line of the movie the whole time. Pedro is simply not a good villain. It is so laughably bad, but they dragged the movie on for days. It's as if 3 separate movies were made about each main/supporting character and they pieced them together in the editing room. The action scenes randomly appear in the movie, but then they quickly end and go back to the random story lines."

.

First of all, let me say that in watching a superhero movie I expect the super heros to be larger than life, able to jump higher, run faster, lift impossible weights and objects with relative ease... That's just a given. And Diana is all of that and a bag of chips. And I accept that there will be tech involved that doesn't work in the real world or is more amazing than reality actually allows... I also expect great slomo shots and impossible but beautiful cinematography. These are all just standard features of modern storytelling.The mall fight scene at the beginning of the movie didn't do anything to really enhance the story or plot. All it did was set the stage for the era of the 80s. Though I swear one of the bad guys had to have been picked because he looked vaguely like Clint Eastwood, and I find that hilarious.The main plot and story was interesting in an almost but not quite cliche way.But my biggest gripes are:
1. Suddenly she can fly. I mean I get her lassoing an airplane and popping up into the sky, but after that it was just ""she's lassoing clouds now. How does that even work."" And then that degenerated into she's just flat out flying.
2. She's suddenly in the ancient armor that she had stored in her apt. They didn't explain how or why... just that she is. And then the armor being amazing enough to survive the original use to fend off the greeks and survive completely intact.... but is falling apart in moments from the Barbara/Cheetah's attacks? WTF?
3. Barbara spent her one wish... and then gets a second to become an apex predator? Because Maxwell is ""feeling generous?"" That's not what happened earlier in the movie when he tried to get a second wish from another guy. You can't even be consistent with your own rules of the story? WTF?
4. This blue light beam in the middle of the gov's military studio? Convenient for classic bad guy cinema shots... Super cliche classic. And it ends with him and Diana influencing what I can only assume is the ""proton beam"" (that's not how that would work at all).
5. Yes, Diana saved the world and somehow managed to entice people to ""renounce"" their petty wishes. Yay. We still have the problem of Maxwell Lord ""being the crystal"" and able to grant wishes... Not everyone was watching TV at the same time. And the satellites to over-broadcast local tv stations (never mind that this tech is completely made up, but we can go with it for the sake of the movie) would not have been numerous enough to broadcast to the entire planet all at the same time, plus people on the dark side of the planet are sleeping through this... so there are plenty of people Maxwell could get a wish from still."
57," Last review was deleted!!!
","I saw my review posted with full text and now it is gone, not even readable from my account. They are purging negative reviews. Do not buy this terrible movie!! It is not worth 2.5 hrs of your time.The writing and plot are the worst of any DC movie so far and that is saying something. Unfortunately, the stylized action and good CGI that helped make the previous installments rise above the writing is not present here. The CGI is bad and there isn't much action. I think Wonder Woman felt less strong as a person in this movie than the last one. The villain was lame, and the armor she wears in the promotional material was pointless."
58," Completly Delusional
","The downfall of mankind is here and the rise of womankind is here. It quite a pathetic movie, probably representing present american zeitgeist. its like a super hero parody. Hopefully times get better in 2021."
59," Pure Garbage
","How can the first one be so good, and this one so bad. Yeah, I wanted to walk out on it but I watched it at home."
60," Ouch -- so painful to watch
","This is, without question, one of the worst films I have seen in my life -- a paint-by-numbers approach to screenwriting, but by people who clearly can't count from one to two without getting lost. The saddest aspect here is that Kristen Wiig is utterly wasted here. Her character was the most engaging early on, but then the filmmakers don't seem to have any idea what sort of character they want her to be. What a waste of time and money."
61," Awful almost everything

62," Action movie set in 80s with no 80s soundtrack. Fail.

64," Green Lantern was a masterpiece compared to this movie.
",Green Lantern was a masterpiece compared to this movie. If I could give a negative star rating this would be the movie.
65," ALL THE CRITICS ARE POLITICAL LIARS!
","The movie was disappointing enough, but the only reason I came here to make a review is to comment on the bs propaganda that the critics are making. Variety says the movie was out of control, depicting the enormous talent of Jenkins (...talent to destroy a film). I think somewhere on RottenTomatoes someone said this was one of the best superhero movies ever (Can anyone actually, reasonably, make that a justifiable argument?). BBC said this was one of the most enjoyable blockbuster films since 1984 (That could only be true if you've never seen a single, other superhero movie).....and many more critics posing as the voice of the people, trying to so obviously DICTATE to us that this should indeed be considered a magnificent movie. What mindless sheep that follow the screaming anger of trying to force the public to believe in something that isn't actually true. I suppose it's because Jenkins is a female. Wow! Let's bow down to such greatness.It's so disappointing that BS POLITICS IS ALL THAT MATTERS for movie critics. It is obvious and apparent of the simple fact that being a female director is all you need to get great reviews.These people or organizations, whatever, that claim themselves to be critics, are simply trying to push the agenda that we, the people, should celebrate this movie to be a grand masterpiece, simply for the fact that it was directed by a woman, regardless of the reality that this was really a movie for little kids. Anyone older will not actually be impressed by it - as the true reviews of people indicate to us.Shall we take a moment to regard an actress who quit the Marvel movies because they didn't want to stay onboard a sinking ship? Go ahead Portman, go somewhere else to defend lackluster talent in directing movies. What a hero! (haha)No offense whatsoever is meant to the actors, nor Jenkins herself. It's the critics that claim this to be such a masterpiece, when in fact, it's a very poor excuse for good film making."
66," Wasn't worth the hype
",Gal Gadots acting is so lame and she isn't fit to play the role . She was just hyping about the movie the entire time and did a terrible job . The movie was so lame that people started leaving the theatre .
67," If you don't like someone, recommend them this movie
","The first 5 minutes where somewhat entertaining, but right after you are hit with some cheesy dialogue, followed by super weak action scenes set in the 80s. Had I only known the whole movie was going to be like that.If you want to see the stunning Gal Gadot walking around in nice outfits, then this is your movie. Other than that, it is pure trash. Also, what was up with WW's obsession with Steve? She's got to move on."
68," I came here for the reviews 😂
",I actually haven't watched the movie because a friend told me it was horrible. I checked these reviews to back up friends option.I'm delighted to find even after a bad film most reviewers still have their sense of humor
69," Probably the worst modern superhero movie
","This movie is a real disappointment, everything about this movie has just been executed so poorly. The plot is so paper thin and comes off as some really bad fan fiction.As you will know from watching the trailers Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) is back, going into this I was really interested in how they were going to bring him back 40 years after he had died. The answer to this is so unsatisfying just like the rest of the movie. There is no logical reasons for anything that happens in the movie the answers are always so paper thin it just come off as because they wanted to.How is Steve back? Because they wanted him back. How is the jet invisible? Because they want an invisible jet in this one. How can Diana fly (and not fly in movies set after this)? Because they want her too. Why does Diana have gold armour and wings? Because they want her too, it looks cool! (They should have done the stupid flying scene after she put on that suit, this would have made sense with the continuity set by the other movies).I could go on for pages about all of the other issues with the movie, bad pacing, no action, bad acting, terrible fish out of water (seen it a million times before) jokes.. the list just goes on.It's a shame as the first movie was a good start but this movie has a completely different tone and really seems like something that would have came out in the 90's, Batman Forever vibes.Just skip this, at 2 and a half hours long it's not worth wasting that much of your life to see."
70," Weak plot, worst ending possible
",I like the cast. That was all I liked. Ending was so corny didn't even get to the credits before turning it off. The first one was pretty good. This one is cringy. What a let down.
71," Comparing To Blade Runner 2049
",It is a sequel that is unneededIt is too longThe ONLY thing going for it is a couple of pretty chicks with good bodiesThe story makes no sense.
72," One the worst mainstream films ever made.
","Everything is wrong in this film; it comes across as some amateur dramatics first attempt at a play. You would think they must have run out of money or changed director multiple times to end up with this mess.The editing is terrible, scene's just pop-up and end uncomfortably with no real flow or sense.There is scene at the beginning of the film where Wig is holding some papers she dropped and, on every cut, the papers move to a different place. I can understand some continuity errors, but to have about 4 in one 2-minute scene is amazing.You have this bizarre plane scene, which stretches believability like a giant snapped elastic band.
How can he fly a modern plane?Why is it ready and fuelled up?Why are people working at night in an airport tower when this is not an operating airport?Why would making a plane invisible, make it invisible to radar?Why doesn't Diane use her new ""make things invisible"" power more often?How can a small fighter fly from America to the Egypt?Why does a plane hover at 1 mile per hour in a sea of fireworks?How did they land and get out of the plane?How did they get out of Egypt?Now these are the problems with just one scene!On top of this, the CGI is terrible, the acting is awful, and the plot is stupid.There are scenes of chaos at the beginning of the movie, when nothing really has happened, why? Is this just bad editing?Oh yeah and Wonder Woman can now fly. Which is strange as this is set before Justice League or Superman V Batman, where she cannot.I looked at some of the critic reviews here and I actual wonder (see what I did there) if they saw the movie. How can anyone think the movie can get a remotely positive review. Its like buying a car with 2 wheels and no doors and saying the car is not that bad.There are some review here giving a rating higher than 5! (some even 10, which must be a studio connection).1/10 is too generous."
73," Too Long And Preachy, And LONG
","Gal Gadot is one beautiful woman, but as an actress let's hope she can improve. The only really good performance was turned in by Pedro Pescal as (Maxwell Lord). Other Character actors were also OK, but both Chris Pine (Steve) and Kristin Wiig (Barbara) were terrible. Pine was wimpy and I truly believe that his doppelganger Buster Poindexter could have turned in a better performance as a leading man. Wiig is twenty years too old to pull off the part of the goofy scientist girl (Barbara) and looked like a Grandma when she was supposed to be sexy. They both were pathetic. Another major mistake was the guy who wrote the overbearing music score Hans Zimmer combined with a terrible job of directing by Patty Jennings who should have hired Buster P to write the films score. Jenkins, If that's her real name, wore everything out with one scene having Chris ""teetering on Schlub status"" Pine change into 10 different outfits. By the last change I expected Ricy Ricardo to come out in his boxers and tell ultra serious Gal ""I have nothing to where."" Another scene had Gal and Dexter flying over fireworks and it went on forever with no payoff. The movie was also at times mean spirited going after a number of Muslim Country's, Asians, Indians, Russians, and even having the Irish take a kick in the teeth.
There was one scene when Gal saved a couple of Palestinian Children and I kept waiting for her to pontificate to the kids the virtues of apartheid. Gal is a world class beauty but she was quite wooden and stoical showing no feel for comedy or any sense of vulnerability with her constantly bossing around every one else in the film. This one was not quite as bad as Charlie's Angels, because Gal is a whole lot easier to look at then the girl with the buck teeth, but it is still a Major Long and Boring, Too Darn Long, LOOSER."
74," No, giving just 1 star makes no sense, its not that bad.
","But giving it an 8 or 9 star also makes no sense at all. So for me, it is a five at most. Before I watched WW84, I already read some bad reviews, so I was prepared. That helped, that helped a lot. The first Wonder Woman movie was great. For me, that was a 9-star movie.Don't get me wrong. WW84 had some nice scenes. But also, moments, I just wanted to turn off the movie. My wife stopped watching altogether and instead watch a TV Show. The WW84 mall scene... that hurt. It was a lousy slapstick. The person who designed/wrote that part should be fired and never be allowed to work in the movie or TV industry.But the bottom line is, would 'I' recommend it? No, but that for you to decide."
75," Walked out
",Nothing happens and there's nothing to care about for the 90 mins we managed to sit through. So boring.
76," I wish it hadn't been made
","This is the ""Halle Barry Catwoman"" kind of bad.It feels like every scene included every colour of the rainbow. What happened to the dark DC universe?"
77," Anyone who scored this over 5 is kidding themselves
","One of the worst movies I have ever seen. Every single review over 5 in here are lying, actually make that over a 3. It is 2.5 hours I will never get back. Storyline was terrible, most of the CGI was ridiculous. We wanted to walk out after 20 minutes but stayed as it was an organised event."
78," The tagline should be Worse than the first
","I never thought I'd see a film worse than Ishtar, but this is it. Before the midpoint, I rated it a 3 out of 10, but it continued to become more worthless as it went along. Really, really bad movie."

3.- C.G.I. as mediocre as it can get.

87," This is possibly the worst DC Movie ever
","The best thing about this movie is that I didn't spend the $120 bucks it would have taken to see it in the theater. DC did the world a favor by making it online at the same release date - this might have been the one greatest thing of CV19; DC contributed to the economics of the world by letting us keep money instead of spending it for this 2 hour disaster of a movie. This is better than anything the government has done (so at least we get one star there)Is it bad? its so bad that it make Sphere look like a good movie and Iron man Oscar material in comparison. Don't watch it. Don't even think about watching it. Watch the entire tv series again if you need your fix.
OH ok, lynda carter was good. But you have to wait until after the credits for that part."
88," Over the top to the point of being ridiculous, and some poorly done effects
","I can understand the necessity of suspension of disbelief in superhero movies, but it's really hard to make a good story based on ""wishes"", and WW84 tried valliantly, but came up short.Without giving up too much about it, the gist follows the ""monkey's paw"" legend, where folks can make wishes, but they all come with inevitably dire consequences. One leads to another, and another, and so on, and gets to the point of being absolutely ridiculous.However, that wouldn't be so bad if not for the totally inconsistent and contrived solution and climax to the film.Finally, and here's what really disappointed me about this film: there are some scenes and shots that are beautiful or cool, but some of the special effects look really amateur by today's standards. Like when WW swoops up to pick up two kids on the street to save them from something... it's almost cartoonish.Nevertheless, it was somewhat entertaining."
89," Really? No one wishes for world peace? - Jenkins dropped the ball she threw
","The movie is flat, Plot holes all over the place and a ""beautiful message"" hidden somewhere in between Pedro Pascals over the top interpretation and a terrible writingGadot and Wiig are amazing actors but their characters were toned down and instead of empowerment we get that their insecurities and ""womanly desires"" fall in the ridiculousPatty Jenkins - and DC - didn't keep in mind a whole universe and the 80's feels like an excuse to go over the top on many things and issues.The world decides to give back their wishes, to lose everything before they... lose everything or something like that?The ONLY memorable two scenes are the opening one when WW is racing the other amazonians and maybe the fireworks and logic behind the invisible jet...See it, it will be two hours of your life where you'll be entertained but definitely not an empowering movie, not a smart movie and challenge yourself to ignore the galore of plot holes"
90," Almost Unwatchable
",I enjoyed the first one but 1984 was a huge disappointment. I'm not sure how they even decided to go into production with such an awful script. This one sets DC back. DC just pay Christopher Nolan whatever he wants to get your franchise the respect it deserves.
91," Dumbest Story/Plot Ever
",This film is such a disappointment. Logic and common sense are just thrown out the window with the horrible execution of an even worse plot and storyline.
92," Very boring!
",Very boring movie! Gal Gadot is great but the story and the movie was not interesting.
93," It's a shame
","Very stupid, very boring and very very SILLY.
Honestly it's a shame for all Sci-fi and super heros movies."
94," Believe the negative reviews
","Wonder Woman is not wonderful.This wasn't the horrible movie some reviewers make it out to be. 1 & 2 stars is a bit exaggerated-- I save such ratings for worst of the worst. At the worst this is simply a disappointing, poorly-written, badly-directed comic-book movie (emphasis on comic book writing... and there have been better comic books).Still, believe the negativity. This movie has so very many flaws. I'll sum the entire movie up in one scene: roping a lightning bolt and swinging from it.Seriously?WW'84 made me feel like I was watching the 1970s Wonder Woman with all its ridiculous camp. With almost 2000 reviews here I don't need to spend a lot of time writing this one. A bunch of people are going to see this movie. Some are going to love it because well... that's some people. Some people will like it because of Gadot or Pine. A whole lot more are gonna be justifiably disappointed.There are worse movies out there. Wonder Woman is bad, but remember Batman and Robin? Electra? Catwoman? Some reviewers need a bit more perspective and balance. And some movie writers and directors need a lot more talent."
95," Cliched and tired...
","Just a really bad movie on every front. Gadot doesn't look like she's having fun, the script is ridiculously predictable, and there just isn't anything vaguely of interest here.Granted, Gadot looks great, but that's about it. Her acting's wooden, Pedro Pascal is almost a caricature of a TV con man, and they could have removed Chris Pine totally from the movie and you wouldn't have missed anything.Makes me wonder whether there really was a need for a sequel after all. The first movie was genuinely warm and had a lot of heart. This, on the other hand, is a weak dribble. Pointless, bland, predictable and totally forgettable."
96," Dissapointed
",Not sure what I expected but it wasn't that. Poor story line.Wouldn't even be worth a second watch.
97," Get me a bucket quick!!!
",This has got to be one of the worst Wonder Woman movies ever made. The movie starts out well and give hope. once the first seen is over it is a 90 degree drop. There was potential to make it a decent movie but then they botched it up. The movie tries to bring in too much romance and even for a superhero movie is just not consistent. I think a child could have written a better script. If you can give this movie a miss do that. If you are bored out of your skull and watch it just understand u might come out even more bored.
98," I never expect much from action movies, but...
","... at the very least I hope the fight scenes are enjoyable. Wonder Woman 1984 manages to fail even on that matter. When WW fights thugs, she pretty much swings around on her lasso, Spider-man style, throwing them here and there until they get tired. C'mon, Diana has enough power to put up a fight with Superman (although she wouldn't ultimately win), she should be able to knock out four untrained human beings in a split second.
Then, when she fights Cheetah, one of the main villains, the same thing happens: a lot of cringey swinging and jumping around.
By the way, Diana learned how to fly by the end of the first movie; she shouldn't need to rely on her lasso to propel her up in the air. Apparently, that's another thing from Wonder Woman (2017) that has been ignored.
Honestly, action movies are known for putting 90% of the effort on the fight scenes and special effects, leaving the rest for plot and character development. Wonder Woman 1984 manages to fail miserably on both. Give these guys an award, please."
99," Best thing about the movie....
",Reading the reviews here has been the best part of this movie. This felt like an afternoon bad DC animation ment for 10 year olds. And that's generous... Watch it for a laugh. Don't expect single thing carried over from the first movie. 👎👎👎👎👎
100," Couldn't make it past 45 minutes
","45 minutes in and there is no discernable plot, the 80's setting is entirely over-the-top and adds nothing to the narrative, the characters are way over acted, and the opening sequence was so CGI filled that I felt like I was watching a cartoon. Unwatchable."
101," Well done DC
","Y'll just made a Worse movie than justice league 👍It was like Gal did'nt want to be a part of this movie, like she was forced to because her acting was so blank. I thought maybe they casted Kristen Wig for a little comedy sections but she was useless and boring ( not even entertaining) Chris Pine was the only one acting but it was very awkward to watch him being the only one trying. Im sorry I used more than 2 hours on this movie when I could sit and watch the snow falling and remember the good times before covid.."
102," It should have been just a 40 minutes TV episode
",Hence proved Marvel Uinverse is better than DC universe. I love DC superheroes more but the stories they green light for production are hideous and juvenile
103," The worst movie of the year.
","The worst movie of the year. Bad actors, non-existent script, inconsistent visual effects. A shame close to the excellent first movie. Pathetic."
104," Wish I could get my 2 hrs 31 mins back! I'll happily give anything!
","This was an extremely disappointing movie. The first movie was very good but this will probably be the end of the WW movie franchise. Maybe a reboot in 20 years, it'll take that long to get over this monstrosity.The script was weak, the acting in parts was poor (at best) and the 1984 setting added no value to the to story.Reading the User Reviews for this movie is far more entertaining than watching it."
105," I Renounce my wish to watch Wonder Woman 84
","The story is a joke!!! this movie was a big mistake by D.C ... the story is super bad, I think anyone with a conscience knows that this movie is pretty bad, I don't understand the producers of this movie. The first movie was pretty good but I want to erase the second one from my brain 🤣...can I add 0 star?"
106," Embarrassingly awful
","The writing was that of a fourth grader's school assembly. The design was absent from the story. The story made no sense in any way whatsoever. It was so long. So so very long. These were good actors giving the worst performances. The editors and director should be apologizing to the actors for choosing these takes. The concept was dumb and inconsistent. The extras felt like they were told to ham it up. It held up every awful stereotype. The relationships felt like most of the people met that day, and were uncomfortable around each other. It was not even fun. It had a couple of decent nonsensical action scenes, but the constant shift in her powers, and the overuse of the lasso were unflattering. I am embarrassed for everyone involved in the decision making for this film. The first movie was so good - and this was no just a bad sequel, but the worst superhero movie I have ever seen - and I have seen almost all of them. I often get accused of being too easy on certain films. I would maintain, the above is STILL going easy on this film. Horrendous on every level."
107," If I could rate zero I would
","Quite possibly one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. No plot development. No character development. Absolute atrocious storyline, cheesiest end since Adam west batman days. Only saving grace is gal Gadot is in it. Little to no action. The movie just doesn't make any sense. Whoever did the editing on this movie needs to get fired. This is the metaphorical nail on the coffin for DC universe. Please don't waste your time with this garbage"
108," Abysmal
","The first Wonder Woman was a great movie, through and through.
1984 however, is nothing like the first one.There's very little action, but what there is is poorly CGI'd.
The plot is pretty thin - be careful what you wish for, and don't be greedy - which by coincidence, is the technocrat's theme for 2021 ie the ""Great Reset"".The film doesn't make any sense! Diana, (Wonder Woman) and Steve Trevor - the WWI pilot from the 1st film (whose spirit now inhabits the body of a present day ""handsome guy"") need to travel to Egypt to save the world. Only Steve hasn't brought his passport! So they break into the Smithsonian Museum to steal a jet plane - which happened to have a few working planes in the back, fuelled and ready to go! But wait a minute - why not use ""handsome guy's"" passport - especially since that's who Steve now resembles, to everyone except Diana.
Diana exhibits some sudden new abilities, like rendering their plane invisible, and gliding / flying around the world!
Finally, at the climax of the movie, Diana doesn't beat her enemies into defeat - she appeals to their better natures - and they all decide to turn over a new leaf. ""Sorry about all that death and destruction back then, folks. My bad."""
109," Not worth catching COVID-19 for
","The review scores and review content from critics seems to be disconnected but I instantly digress.This movie was a mess from start to finish with a ridiculous plot device that could only send it down a road that makes it nonsensical. Gal Gadot is excellent in her role but Kristen Wigg had the same trajectory as she did in Paul (except she didn't end up turning into a cat in Paul - someone needs to explain to me how this happened anyway).On the flipside, there was some very visually spectacular scenes, some solid sound and excellent score by Hans Zimmer."
110," DC does it again
","I believed in the heart the Wonder Woman brand created like countless of others. The first wonderfully set up the super heroine for greatness and they filmed and wrote it wonderfully. I'm not saying it was amazing, but it was surprisingly better compared to the other films in DCs library. But the WW84 was a sad waste of my time as they shot the film from the three point line straight into the garbage. Nothing but net for DC. The film was so slow, lazy, and disrespectful to the DC fans who saw the first as a success in a sea of disappointment. The villain, played by Pascal, could've been a great foe but with questionable actions and character choices by the writing team left so much more to be desired. The chemistry between Gadot and Pine was refreshing if one of the limited silver linings in the 2 hour movie. While it had heart-even a super basic salt and pepper heart-it was still two sizes too small this holiday season."
111," Can't blame covid for this awful piece.
","Worst movie I have seen in a long time. I was bored within the first 30 mins and would have walked out if I knew I could have gotten a refund.
The plot is just plain bad. Bad CGI/graphics, More successful as a failed love story than a super hero movie. DC movies always feel a little lacking that something special but this one is just a pure bomb.So embarrassed for Gal Gadot."
112," TERRIBLE
","The first movie was engaging from the very beginning, colorful and exciting. It's only agenda was to draw in the audience and give them pure entertainment with blockbuster appeal.This new movie seems to have forgotten all that made the first Wonder Woman a great movie. This movie seemed to be designed around a political message (""Don't work hard to be wealthy; money is a danger"") from the plot to the set designs to the dialogue. I'm not a fan of political messages in Hollywood and actually look to Hollywood as an escape from the constant onslaught of politics in our media and elsewhere. It's such a disappointment when a movie that could have been fantastic ends up being a political ploy.Please return to producing only blockbusters with the simply goal of pure enjoyment and leave the politics to Indie films.Such a disappointment."
113," My GOD .... this has to be crowned THE WORST MOVIE EVER ....
","I can hardly find my words being in shock after watching this ... thing (I even cannot call it a movie).I am a fanatical movie fan, I do watch movies everyday for years.
I watched tons of relevant titles.But this ...... really put me in shock .
Even if I would have wished to imagine the worst movie possible in ALL aspects , I couldn't go lower than this one...In some respect, this movie is a masterpiece . And I mean in terms of ""how to make EVERYTHING worst possible"".
It is a perfect combination of script, directing, idea, acting and ... you name what, being as far as possible from a good , or at least decent movie.It is worth to be watched as an example of the dark side of the range in terms of movie making....... . I even would award it some kind of trophy.
I am really sorry about Gal Gadot, they put here in a very bad light, she can really have a good performance in a normal movie. Even her acting was bad, by the influence of the dark spirit of this movie ... it's embarrasing.
The first movie was good, I enjoyed watching. It is even more shocking how could they come up with this, so far far away compared to the first movie ...
In a word : AWFUL .
Worth to watch just to see the bottom of Movies quality in every aspects.PS. : I never waste time writing reviews, this is my first and only one ... I've made an account just to upload this review. God ...I am still in shock ...."
114," Obviously the feminists are bumping this up
","I think critics feel they have to rate female directors now days even if the direction and story is tripe. Give this a miss, you won't regret it."
115," I guess we longer need Superman or Spiderman
","Very disappointed.
The opening scene with (I'm guessing) a young Dianna running some kind of competitive obstacle course, Olympic type thingy was a ""pod race"" moment for me. Didn't care. The CGI was bad. The physics of horses jumping caverns, and little Di jumping of cliffs onto horses was unbelievable.There was a scene where Di and her boyfriend were being chased by amour vehicles with the typical Hollywood ""We're gonna shoot at you with AK 47s but not ACTUALLY do any damage to the car 'cause that would be bad""
There was some things in the chase scene stolen from Indiana Jones.Wonder woman's new skills:
And apparently wonder woman is so good with the rope she can pull a 50 Cal bullet out of the air, call lightning bolts out of the sky and swing on them cloud to cloud, swing through buildings like Spiderman, and I guess now she can fly?Stupid stuff:
Di's boyfriend who flew single engine propeller planes, can, APPARENTLY just sit in a fighter jet (that just happens to be fueled and ready to go sitting on the runway) and with NO TRAINING can fly said fighter jet, because, you know they are very similar to propeller planes.The ending was over-the-top contrite and frankly impossible.The only saving thing for me was the chemistry between Di and her boyfriend was natural and really good.I would not pay more than $5 to see this."
116," Worse than Catwoman and Elektra
","I created an account on IMDB just to try and save at least one person from wasting time like my family and I did watching WW84. STOP and do not waste your time. Other than Gal Gadot being the perfect casting for WW, this movie has zero redeeming qualities. The post title says it all."

119," Green lantern was better
","As much as I love super hero movies this was bad, I mean worst than green lantern bad, awful I walked out of my own house bad"
120," It was just a generic sequel actually...
","I did actually enjoy the 2017 movie ""Wonder Woman"" quite a bit, so I was definitely looking forward to this 2020 movie from writers Patty Jenkins, Geoff Johns and Dave Callaham.And while ""Wonder Woman 1984"" was definitely a watchable movie, it just wasn't really up to par with the 2017 movie in anyway. Why? Well, simply because the storyline felt way too comical and the villains in the movie weren't really all that interesting or menacing.The storyline told in ""Wonder Woman 1984"" just fell short of being all that entertaining. Sure, it was a watchable movie, but it was hardly an outstanding or particularly memorable foray into the D.C. world of superheroes. For me, the storyline here felt like something that had been ping ponged around a breakfast table, with the writers just tossing out ideas and settling on something that seemed like something that could be made into a Saturday morning cartoon.Of course it was nice to have Gal Gadot return to portray Diana/Wonder Woman in this 2020 movie, and she was joined with talents such as Chris Pine, Kristen Wiig and Pedro Pascal. I must admit that Pedro Pascal's performance was actually the most brilliant and enjoyable in the movie, and his character was the one with the most appeal in the movie. Mind you, as a villain he just wasn't all there. I mean, it was more of an average Joe come into power situation, so it took away from the usual superpowered villain stuff you'd expect to see in a D.C. movie.For me, the whole granting wishes thing concept of the movie just felt out of place, and like something that belonged in a whole different type of movie. It just failed to captivate me, and proved to have little entertainment value in terms of being the focal point of a superhero movie.Visually then ""Wonder Woman 1984"" was all there, just like the 2017 movie was. So the visual effects team definitely worked their magic with this 2020 movie, no doubt about that.While I have now seen ""Wonder Woman 1984"" once, I doubt that I will be returning to watch it a second time, as the storyline just felt out of place and too weak for a movie for Wonder Woman.My rating of ""Wonder Woman 1984"", sadly, lands on a very mediocre five out of ten stars."
121," Blunder Woman 2020
","This movie is shockingly bad.
I would like to get myself a drream stone so that I can wish two and a half hours of my life back.
The story is terrible, the acting is lacklustre, the VFX/CGI is blocky, the movie is too long and it left me feeling like DC had completely sold out.
I did enjoy Kristen Wiig's involvement because she has been just under the radar for most of her career and this flick gave her a chance to shine, but overall I think this movie could actually be the beginning of the end of a few careers, hopefully first and foremost one Patty Jenkins who must surely carry the can for this poor effort (she's apparently got the keys to a third installment!)Terrible, terrible movie......... quite a fitting end to 2020"
122," One of the WORST DC movie i've ever seen since JL :(
","I'm really Dissapointed. First movie is brilliant. But this. Man i think JL and Suicide Squad better than this Sh**. I loved the first one but this one is a real dissapointment. From my perspective, this one doesn't even deserve a one star :("
123," Way too much to say
","So I finally figured out why this movie is called Wonder Woman 1984. That's because it takes its inspiration from the pre-Marvel Cinematic Universe superhero movies that are adaptions of the comics in name only. I'm looking at you, Supergirl, which came out in 1984*.Yes, before superhero movies took over the world, we got movies like Superman IV: The Quest for Peace and the Spider-Man and Captain America TV movies (and Superman III and the Cannon Captain America too, while we're at it).In 1984, we were lucky if we got a great superhero film.In 2020, we forgot what that time was like.Directed by Patty Jenkins from a script she wrote with Geoff Johns** and Dave Callaham, based on a story by Johns and Jenkins, this is a movie that people have really hated with a passion. So many people have said that it's campy, but they really have no idea what that word means. This is in no way the 1960's Batman TV series. It's not Barbarella. We could only dream that it could be a tenth of a percent as campy as Danger: Diabolik or Flash Gordon***.It's the very definition of a movie that has no idea what it wants to be, the story that it wants to tell or how the characters will learn or grow along the way. It only hamfistedly smashes plot points - Honesty is good! Lies are bad! - with all the subtlety of Obnoxio the Clown.It all starts in the home of the Amazona, Themyscira, where a kid version of Diana Prince competes against the older Amazons and learns that cheating won't get her anywhere. This is generally called foreshadowing, but again, this is a plot point hammered home so completely that even Bizarro would find himself saying, ""Me not get it!""We move to 1984, sixty-six years after we last saw our heroine in the last movie, and she's spent the decades pining for Steve Trevor (Chris Pine), who sacrificed himself to save everyone from a bomber filled with poison. Now she's the senior anthropologist at the Smithsonian, working alongside the mousy Barbara Ann Minerva (Kristen Wiig) when she's not foiling robberies at malls that look so garishly 1980's that Nightwing's first costume would fit right in.Trust me. I was in the 1980's. I was eight when they started. Everything in here is exactly the 80's marketing people think the 80's are. Anachronism abounds to the point that I was expecting Rip Hunter to show up and ask Wonder Woman to fix things. ""Diana! Operation Wolf came out in 1987, not 1984! Per Degaton is ruining everything! The Cro-Mags didn't release The Age of Quarrel until 1986 and that kid already has the shirt! Cronos is destroying the time-space continuum! That man is walking a goldendoodle, which wasn't bred until 1990! Monarch is back!""That's when this film's McGuffin comes into play. The Dreamstone can give anyone their wish. Wonder Woman wants Steve back. Barbara wants to be Diana. And Max Lord (Pedro Pascal) wants it all.Yes, Max Lord. The guy who was behind the Justice League International before coming back to kill off Blue Beetle and ruin the DCU for so many people in Countdown to Infinite Crisis.While this isn't a mainstream character, it doesn't have to be. But the truth is, Wonder Woman 1984 is more Max Lord's movie than it is Diana's. He's the one that takes the journey, who changes and becomes a better person at the end once he sees where his bad decisions have taken him. And much like 1984, the year when comic book movies had nothing in common with their print inspirations, he's Max Lord in name only****. He's more Donald Trump than L-Ron's best pal, but that's completely intentional.Within a few days, Lord has pretty much ruined the world with wish after wish*****. Barbara has wished to become an apex predator, a term nobody used in 1984. And Diana has realized that Steve - in another man's body that had sex with Diana without consent, which was a major issue with so many people and something that while upsetting is also something fictional with no way of happening in our reality and to be blunt, we got bigger things to be upset about in 2020 - shouldn't be back from the dead.And that's pretty much it.The biggest sacrifice - Steve going back to death - is made by Steve more than Diana. Barbara never gives up her wish, gets electrocuted and still lives. And Max actually comes out as the person who learns the most, telling his son that he is not a good man.Maybe it's the amount of horror and exploitation films that I watch on a regular basis, but movies are best between 66 and 75 minutes. This one goes near double that and I already told you the whole story in a few paragraphs. It drags. And drags. And then drags some more for good measure.It also doesn't have any real reason to be set in 1984 other than the title and ""Welcome to the Pleasuredome"" by Frankie Goes to Hollywood getting used in one scene. And yes, to be completely OCD, this movie takes place on the Fourth of July and that song was released until October 29 of that year.It's also a $200 million dollar movie that has effects that feel unfinished (just look at the kids turn into obvious dummies when she saves them), a final fight scene that makes the end of Ang Lee's The Hulk look well lit and invalidates much of what we knew of Wonder Woman in Justice League, which claims that she was in hiding the whole time. As for those who claim continuity doesn't work, the old DCU was the most continuity heavy universe ever. Ask Ambush Bug. And continuity is a major reason why the MCU works so well.That said, Gal Gadot is fine as Wonder Woman, for all she is given to do. Kristen Wiig is playing Kristen Wiig and if you told me that this was the same character she was essaying in the Anchorman sequel, I would have believed you. And I guess Pascal is fine, but by the end of this movie, I was moved to ennui and struggling to say anything nice.I mean, go back and watch that fight scene in the mall. It has almost sitcom level mugging in it. I mean, the worst part for me was when Steve is amazed by an escalator and a subway train. The first movie was set in London during the First World War and all of those things existed there at that time. Maybe Steve is just a moron.There you go. I've spent more time figuring this movie out than it really deserved. Let's get back to Jess Franco movies, people.*But some really great comic films came out in 1984. One is based on a comic strip that not many people know called Sweet Gwendoline by John Willie and that would be the strangely great The Perils of Gwendoline in the Land of Yik Yak. The other two aren't based on any comic book but get the tone perfect and those would be The Adventures of Buckaroo Bonzai Across the 8th Dimension and The Toxic Avenger.**Who actually wrote some decent comics every once in a while, like DC's JSA.***Which is the answer to the question, ""What are Sam's two favorite comic book adaptions?""****Just like how its mentioned that the Dreamstone comes from Dolos, The Duke of Deception, who was the first major challenge that Diana faced pst-Crisis.*****One of those wishes is to get his company back from Simon Stagg, who we all know - I'm joking, like four or five of us know - is the father-in-law of Metamorpho."
124," A screenplay is based on a dream and directed whilst on drugs.
","When you direct a movie whilst on drugs, using a screenplay written in elementary school.There is nothing good about this movie apart from the opening which has no connection to the rest of the movie. The rest of this movie is such nonsense in service to deliver some societal or moral message.I wish this movie was never made, and no I won't revoke my wish."
125," It's just not a good movie
","Look, this isn't DCEU bashing or a woman lead bashing. This is what it is. And this just isn't a good movie. It's jumbled, the story is weird and problematic, the villains are cartoony like they're in a different movie (though they are the best part). Gal Gadot just isn't doing good acting, maybe that's just me, but it's bad.Chris Pine is wonderful and steals all his scenes, but there really isn't a point to the character in this, just seems like a shallow ploy just to have him back.Nothing really happens in most of it, it's probably 45 minutes too long. Long stretches of time that add nothing to the story.Shot selection and cgi is weird.It's just not good. And I really wish it was."
126," Simply Painful to Watch
","This movie was so bad, that I felt compelled to write my very first review of a movie online.The wife and I absolutely loved the first Wonder Woman movie - it was easily our favorite DCU movie. WW84, however, was just a huge disappointment. Maybe our expectations were way too high for the second movie? The very first scene was great and gave us high hopes that this movie was going to be as good as the first. BOY, WERE WE WRONG! After that first scene, the rest of the film was slowly paced, poorly written, way too long, and the plot was simply ridiculous. I've never paused a movie this much to get up and get a drink, go to the bathroom, get a snack, walk the dog, etc.I cannot believe Warner Brothers is actually allowing a third movie to be written and directed by the same person who created this piece of garbage. Sure glad I didn't pat to see it in a theatre!"
127," Wonder Woman 84 - mixed opinions
","So, here we are after months and months of delays DC finally relased the highly anticipated WW84, and it is... well... cool. My opinions about the movie are mixed so I will seperate them into 3 categories.1. Good:
Gal Gadot - she is a GODESS, i repeat GODESS! Excelent as Wonder Woman, full of emotion, extremely likable understood the character and did a great job just like in the first movie, maybe even betterPedro Pascal - I just want more of him! Altough his character wasn't developed that much, Maxwell Lord, and is a bit of a predictible personality you can still see he is having a blast playing him and is so entertaining.The visuals - a really beautifull movie to look at ( fireworks scene ), definetly worth seeing it in a theaterStory and message - it kind of felt like a Disney movie with is main theme of ""nothing good is born from lies"" and it's vibrant characters and looks, the pogression of the story is solid and preety interesting, altough it starts slow trying to explain and tell a lot of exposioson about the past and the present, but the second act picks up the pace and it is way more entertaining and action filled than the first act.Chris Pine - loveable as Steve and a nice characterFight scenes - great and really well done ( Mall robbery being the best ) and again. Gal Gadot shows a lot of emotion in them2. Mixed:Kristen Wiig- after the first act i kind of started hating on her character Barbara, which was likeable, with all of the cliche villian tropes she was taking, and when Chettah shows up for a 2 minute fight at the climax her looks reminded me of 2019s ""Cats"" and was a bit cringyWriting - some moments could have been less chessy and could have been written more deeply than they were ( scene where Diana says goodbye to Steve was short and was not that emotinal in terms of dialouge and the reunion of Lord and his son also felt so fast and not that emotinoal )Pacing - sometimes a bit slow, sometimes a bit fast, not good, not bad3. Bad:CGI and green screen - at some moments despite looking fabolus you can clearly, i mean clearly see the green screen moving ( every close up of WW running is awfuly done ) and the CGI being absolutly ridiculous ( Cheetah again ) which sometimes ruins the good moments in the movieLogic - I may be nitpicking but some of the moments really do not feel well explained. Like how does Steve now how to drive a modern airplane, why is he brought back in another persons boddy, modern looking g63 jeeps pulled me from the 80s vibe of the film, for some reason she can fly all of a sudden, and sprint with heavy objects and trucks even though she was supposed to loose powers?... these are just some and there is moreTimeline - so people won't understand Suprerman in Man of Steel because of his alien powers but almost every single person acording to WW could wish an extremly powerful weapon or to start another war or kill someone or become rich or kill a race or... i think you get itOpening sequence - In my opinion, enjoyable but wasn't really necsesary at all since the first movie explained everything about Dianas childhoodThird act - It's what bogged down the first movie from being amazing and here it's just soo dumb with Lord getting to grant everybodys wishes from a secret telepot which teleports his body to every one.. yeah I am confused, to a cringy cheetah fight and a cringy Hallmark ending... 😑At the end, WW84 while flawed and unlogical is still an enjoyable movie with enough action and heart to make it entertaining to watch. I think that it could have been better like the trailers showed, but sadly it was not.5.5/10 for me"
128," Could have been saved with tornados full of sharks.
","Seriously the worst movie I've ever seen.
I watched it with my 3 sons, (14,16,19) and my niece (14), we kept waiting for it to get better. It didn't! My niece was impressed that Wonderwoman could lasso lightning.
There was one really good part, the ending was good. You know, the part where it was over. I liked that!!!"
129," I'm so confused.
","How is this so bad? It's the same director as the first one which was a decent movie by any standard. This is a joke from start to finish. Surely someone must have butted in and forced the director on a certain path?Also, I usually love bad movies, I find them very entertaining and funny. But this didn't even give me that as it was just simply too bad to be entertaining."
130," It felt insulting.
","I'm giving this movie a 1 as I am essentially rating it not as the worst movie ever made, but declaring it to have absolutely no redeeming qualities. Everything was flawed in this movie. Acting, writing, pacing, cgi, actor choice and character portrayal, style, understanding of its audience, etc. I watched this on HBO Max with my girlfriend. I'm very glad we saw it for free. She didn't even believe it was the same director as 2017 Wonder Woman as everything that made the first installment good seemed to be trashed here. I felt as if we were delivered a cheap made for TV movie with at many points, young children, as the conceived audience. Movies like this need to be reviewed harshly as Hollywood's exploitation of its audience has become tirelessly insulting. Note, I am also one of those rare birds who prefers the DC movies over Marvel and actually loved Justice League."
131," has usual, a disapointing DC movie!
","Mediocre acting with no character of Wonder Women, always like it's posing for model photo! Physics of movie are very wrong! A real waste of time! COME BACK MARVEL MOVIES!!!"
132," Movie? MOVIE?
",I don't know what this was but it wasn't a MOVIE! More like some 5 year old took numerous disjointed scenes and glued them to cardboard to take home to mommy!I lost brain cells watching this.
133," How did this get made?!
","Movies like this are why it's hard to trust DC movies. I really wanted to like this movie. I loved the first WW, and was really looking forward to the sequel. The only silver lining was that I didn't waste $100 taking my family to the theater to watch it. I could break the whole movie down, but I'll simplify it like this:
1. Terrible plot
2. Laughable dialogue
3. Hammy overacting
4. Ridiculous villains
5. Huge plot holes
6. Unrealistic CGIThis movie was a trainwreck. It is Green Lantern bad."
134," So lack of consent is fine?
","For a modern big film that is supposed to be a film and more politically correct, it fails massively. I could point out all the plot holes and horrible acting and character development but many posts on here already say that.The bit I want to talk about is Steve's takeover of another man's body. The wish Dianna makes is for Steve to come back but it turns out in another man's body who has no say in the matter. They wake up in bed together which suggests Dianna had some physical contact with him.With all the commotion that has happened in film over the years why is it ok to revert for this film? The man was obviously touched and had no choice in consent with what happens to his body.So when a film is supposed to be breaking new ground it actually reverts back to what so many complained about.Such a shame as the first film was so strong"
135," Nothing happened in the first 40 minutes of the film
","So I just had to turn it off.I'm clearly not fit to watch two and a half hours of people just acting socially awkward.I did not particularly like the first one, but the trailer for WW1984 got me hooked, only to be bored to death and left unable to finish the film."

","Cliche driven storyline with historical inaccuracies, goof ups and borderline nonsense and solely driven by the 80s retro styling.The worse part is highjacking a complete stranger's body by her dead boyfriend's spirit wished upon by the morally true ""Lasso of Truth"" wielding protagonist being fully aware that the body isn't his, normalizes it as okay for her selfish needs.Comparatively, the Green Lantern (2011) would win all the Academy awards."
137," A Wonder Woman movie with almost no Wonder Woman
","Following the first film (which I thoroughly enjoyed), this was almost unwatchable. Why did Diana wish for her boyfriend to come back? Why didn't she wish for her Amazonian family to return? Then at least we would have more than the 10 minutes of these amazing women in action. Gal.. is beautiful, no doubt.. but I was so perplexed as to where her boyfriend re-appeared from, it took some time to realise that she had wished him back - this was so jarring and out of character. Hated it."
138," Garbage
","Why did this come out during the holidays? This is boring and just another utterly horrible plot that DC is trying to ride the superhero train. I think if Marvel made a movie about heroes defecating themselves,, it would still have a better plot than these DC movies."
139," My kids can write a story, better than this
","The first wonder women was brilliant. It had a streamlined story with a goal at the end.
This one, seem like it's all over the place. I keep thinking someone took Whole bunch of comics, and tried to turn all of them into a script.The acting is Ok. But just OK. Steve does a great job, when it comes to being a big kid around anything with wings. But that's also were it stops.
Gal seem to just go through the motion as wonder women. For some reason they have focused a lot on her being a civilian, along with her civilian lifestyle & work. Which is what exactly? She work at a museum or something. But you never get to see her what she does, or know what her job is suppose to be.
She mostly comes into work and everyone just falls in love with her.
A side from the mall scene, which you've seen in the trailer.( And whoever heard about an antique dealer/shop, being located in a Mall. It doesn't make sense.
Malls don't have antique dealers. )
I've seen better heist/ robbery scenes in Dirty Harry movies. And they were made back in the 70s
She doesn't go into costume before, nearly 90 min into the film.
Some of the CGI really need better work. Or more money, which ever comes firstThe plot holes are so many, that you can't manage to let em slide and give the movie benefit of a doubt. The opening scene with the young Diana, at the competition on the island. Doesn't serve any purpose for to movie forward what so ever.
I suspect it was only used, cause they were under contract for some of the same females they used in WW1
They could have focused a little bit more on the fish out of water act with Steve. It would have been a great comic relief. He adapted a bit too fast and well, to 1984.
I mean, he just woke up with the knowledge of how to use a phone book. Not to mention there were only one Diana in the entire phone book?
And how did Steve know how to fly a modern day jet plane, when he was last around Double Decker planes were still a thing?
Also someone need to tell the writers, that making something invisible for the eye, doesn't mean it's invisible for radar.And the bad guys,or should I say bad girl?
Cheetah, may sound like a really cool name, when you naming a car
But as a super villain it just sound lame.
Cheetah's aren't strong. They're actually pretty week. They are short distance sprinters, and usually strangle their pray.
They give all on the chase, and don't have any stamina left to defend their prey nor them self .If it comes to a fight over it.
So turning the super villain, into a cross between a human and cheetah was just silly'& cartoonish.
No to mention the actress mostly has two expressions ""bored"" or ""angry"" I mean aside form the whole dweeb thing she got going"
140," Disgusting movie
",One of the worst movies ive seen. Lasso of truth more like spidys web shooters. The movie was so cringy. Felt like a kids movie. What is this. Why???? I was so looking forward for this movie. I loved the first one. So disappointed really. Wasted 2;30 hours of my life on an absolutely ridiculous movie
141," What WAS this?
",This was an overlong tedius poorly acted poorly written morality play about being careful what you wish for.
142," PAINFUL TO WATCH
",What a disappointment after the better than average 1st film...I'm thinking up writing a screenplay...doubt it could be as bad as this mess...Gal Gadot is a spellbinding beauty and Chris Pine has a few good moments but Pedro Pascal was a big come down from his Mandolorian performance and Kristen Wig is simply miscast...Possibly one of the worst movies in a limited 2020 and certainly an awful sequel...save your time and spare the anguish...pass on this flick...
143," Worst movie ever.
","Don't waste your money and time. Word superhero movie ever, and that's saying a lot."
144," Genre: Comedy but not so funny
","This movie is definitely a parody. WW was maybe the best DC movie of last couple of years (except all time best superhero movies of Nolan's Batman movies). So I had big hopes for this sequel. But after watching this, I can't think of anything positive to write about this movie. Superhero movies including Marvel are getting worse each year. I believe they don't really have to try so hard to make money and this results in movies like WW84."

Very bad CGI but; some visual scenes are good.
Well in summary this movie is just a waste of time."

","First we get 40 minutes of pre movie gibberish that's so cringe worthy my mate walked out of the cinema. Then we had over 2 hours of the worst acting and producing I have seen in a long time, maybe since The Last Airbender. They should be ashamed of this movie."
148," I'm just writing a review because this movie is sooooo bad!!
","I really liked the first movie, and was waiting for the second one. BUT IT IS SO BAD!!!
Terrible plot which is so slow paced and meaningless, the movie felt way too long.
You could've made a 90 minutes movie with this plot, and it still would have been bad and pointless, but 150 minutes of this were literaly painful to watch.
Avoid at any cost!!"
149," Terrible from start to end
","Wow! What a waste of time! Ridiculous, predictable, boring and pretty much an embarrassment. DC you did it again!"
150," I guess one of her superpowers is getting changed in seconds?
","Let me just say, there are many things not quite right with this movie, but the thing that bothered me the most was Diana's costume changes when it just didn't make sense. First she's wearing normal clothes in the car with Steve, chasing these bad guys, and 2 seconds later she's suddenly in her WW attire - excuse me but getting changed in the front seat is no easy task. Also before the last fight scene, seemingly flying to Max Lord's location, she is in her red and blue outfit but then she gets there and she's suddenly wearing the gold armour costume. Did she just decide to make a stop at home and get changed real quick, while Max Lord was in the middle of destroying the planet?
I know there are other more important things I could be getting angry about but I guess her nonsensical costume changes are what I deem the least realistic in this fantasy, made-up world, superhero movie..."
151," One of the few movies I couldn't finish!
","I enjoyed the first WW quite a bit, but I honestly can't think of a movie that I found worse than this. The premise was unbelievable, even for a superhero movie. The first half of the movie dragged and dragged, and then dragged some more (10 mins looking at fireworks???). There were so many continuity gaps and things just thrown in there matter of fact (the lasso can now show people the things and hey, guess what, WW now flies...I'm sorry glides), and the villain(s) stunk.I hated it, my wife hated it, and my 6 and 11 year old girls hated it."
152," Not living up to the Hype!
","First off the visuals where good and A little eye popping, but the whole narrative of the movie and storytelling was Batman forever bad where the story leaves to many loop holes and questions that make wonder what the hell happen, like changing the cheetah's origin and having other dead characters replace people of history like Ronald Reagan who was president in 84' plus leaving you wondering what happened to the wish stone and what Greek God made the stone. I really it was like watching Wonder Woman vs the Wishmaster cause if you have ever seen the Wishmaster movies you know that every time you make a wish it goes wrong or is twisted in some way which describes this movie to a T if you ask me. But I loved seeing Lynda Carter at the end;"
153," I wish I had never seen this 'thing'
","Oh boy...this will be a harsh one.Born dead! We all knew it would flop, but I wasn't expecting it to be that bad!WW84 is probably the worst superhero movie I ever seen, its so bad that make Green Lantern and Captain Marvel look like classics!Diana Prince, mighty amazon warrior fights crime.....in a shopping mall???!!!And the main 'plot' revolves around a genie.....in a rock???!!!!!WHAT THE ACTUAL FÃCK!!!!!The acting is bad, Gal Gadot most of the time has the emotional range of a wooden plank!The CGI is bad, an episode of Star Trek Discovery which probably costs ten times less has way better effects.The amount of wrong agendas that tries to push is cringeworthy.Apart from one scene with an old computer, there is nothing to situate the viewer in 1984, if someone would tell me that the movie happens around 2015, I'd believe it no questions asked. There's not even a music from The Cure, U2 or Duran Duran. For all the wrong things, at least Captain Marvel had a solid 90s soundtrack that corresponded to the time period.And its not even worthy to talk about orange man and his 'wall'.The first one was not great, but holy hell! What happened here???!!!Glad I didn't spend one single dime to watch this forgettable, stupid, soulless garbage.It's a tragic end for what could've been a great series for an iconic character. I mean, it's the end right?! They ain't gonna make another one correct?! Please don't!"
154," If I could give a 0 I would
","From the start to the end this film was absolute drivel. Made no sense whatsoever the whole story was a complete mess whoever approved the storyline needs to be fired. Was really looking forward to this film after the first one apart from the ending and the whole love conquers all thing.

161," It's like being told a story by a 6 year old
","This was the ""Alice in wonderland"" of superhero movies. This movie completely ignores common sense to a point that you can't even excuse it with psuedo science. It was just bad writing. It had some good messages, but couldn't deliver them. It had no focus. It traded all of it's potential to entertain and enthrall for silly concepts that just didn't hold much weight the way they presented it on screen.... They did a lot of telling, but no showing."
162," Straight Garbage
","There's a lot of things wrong with this movie. The beginning doesn't really get your anticipation up wanting to know what's going to happen next. It's very slow paced. Another thing is that, with the exception of Chris Pine's character, all the men in this movie are basically portrayed as horrible creeps. It's clear notion of feminism that suggests the typical ideology that men are bad and women are good.The acting was absolutely horrible. There was no passion from Gal Gadot during her scenes. At least not that I could see. It seemed like she was just there to speak and move in front of a camera instead of bringing the Wonder Woman character to life. I enjoyed the first movie and thought she did a decent job in it, but in this one I just couldn't get into.Let's talk about the Wonder Woman character. So I guess sometime between 1984 and the time of Batman v Superman she forgot how to fly. It makes no sense she is able to fly in this movie and not in the present time of the DCEU. And also, given the events of this movie, the existence of Wonder Woman should have been well established by the time Batman was looking for her. How were these events supposed to be kept secret from Batman?! DC really just needs to kill their DCEU project, hire new writers and directors, and start over."
163," This was such a disappointment
",I was actually excited to see this movie even got HBO max to watch it. Boy was I disappointed the first 30mins. This movie had horrible acting and plot was a joke. The first movie was a fun watch but this? Come on great actors but just a bad movie. DC is not consistent!
164," Singing ""Imagine"" was more bearable than this.
","No, seriously, Gal Gadot's disaster singing ""Imagine"" by the Beatles during lockdown was easier to watch. I havn't seen more pathetic writing and directing in movies since Hallmark. And somebody gave this team money for a new Cleoptra movie?"
165," Good God, what a terrible movie.
","I got about half way though this movie when I had the overwhelming urge to turn it off. My wife (who despises superhero movies) said, ""no, you need to finish the move so you'll never be tempted to watch it again."" She was right. Never again."
166," The only ""wonder"" here is will you be able to survive the 2.5hrs of utter implausibility?
","Here's an idea for a movie, give a character a magic lasso, that can do pretty well anything, dump them in a few action scenes (but nothing too expensive on the CGI bill if you know what I mean) and then sit back and watch your audience eat up all of that utter implausibility. Here's a couple of examples of what I mean.Why not use your magic lasso to grab onto planes in flight in order to speed your journey along. Disregarding the the fact that you'd need a really, really long lasso to start with, I do however struggle to accept that lassoing a commercial airliner travelling at probably in excess of 700kts will result in a positive experience for either the plane or the one lassoing it.Not enough for you? OK, sticking with the aeronautic theme, why not steal a museum-piece fighter jet from Washington and fly it to Egypt. So here's the thing, even if it was fully loaded with fuel, I mean, isn't that what they do with all museum aircraft, have them fully tanked just in case they need to take one out for a spin? The plane would need to be refueled in flight probably a dozen times to make that distance. Again, let's give the writer's a pass for this hugely implausible solution to their travel problem just don't get me started on how they managed to navigate the distance or understood the technology needed in order to fly the plane.Just like the Ponzi scheme mentioned in the film, the plot here is so stacked on ridiculousness that the only thing that holds it all together is the charisma of Gal Gadot. Yes, she holds it together pretty well but I swear there are a couple of scenes in there where you can see even her wondering what the hell she's doing. Hence why she's called Wonder Woman."
167," How to end a superhero's career:
","Hire Jenkins. She single-handedly wrote and directed the worst superhero film in the history of super hero films, and there's no close second. That was the longest waste of time watching the sappiest superhero movie.It was infantile, ridiculous, and riddled with plot and technical issues. Long, lame dragged out and unnecessary scenes. The dialogue was horrendous. I get that she's a newb writer, but having two other seasoned writers - Geoff Johns and Dave Callaham, there is no excuse for this horrible story. A 5th grader could've written this better.As an experienced director, she also failed miserably in her direction of the entire 151 minute runtime. Even the great Hans Zimmer's score was too loud, constant and overbearing. Who green-lit this poor excuse of a superhero movie?Linda Carter must've cringed cashing her cameo paycheck. It's a very generous 3/10 from me, all going to the poor crew that at least came up with some decent S/VFX."

170," Don't waste your time with this Wasted WW
","The writer needs to retire. Another writer for the next film would be great for fans. Zack Snyder wrote the first film. Patty Jenkins directed the 02 films, but unfortunately Patty Jenkins wrote the script for the second. You can even leave her as a director on the third. But don't let her write any lines."
171," Who knows letting the director taking over storytelling and screenplay can turn a good series into total disasters
","The original WW was a good superhero movie, but this one is 99% garbage. Trying to understand what foundamental change could have caused such gold to trash change, I easily spotted that the director is also story writer for WW84. Everything makes sense to me now. Being so self-absorbed and firing the screenplay writer indeed shows whose work was the key to the success of the original WW, and this piece of trash WW84."
172," Waste of time

I don't know what they were thinking when writing this. It is just plain bad. But I guess that fits with 2020 in general. Too bad, for the Wonder Woman franchise."

It doesn't make sense that she keeps her identity a secret yet she spends a good amount of time rescuing kids in public, in her WW outfit, in full view of large crowds. Also, wouldn't her Wonder Woman have come in handy at the end? She could have gone on live tv and told the world to take back their wish. Also, why didn't anyone wish for the nuclear missiles to disappear??? Skip this dreck. Here's hoping Patty Jenkins is replaced for the third WW! 🤞🏻"

The first 20 minutes were great! Then it turned into a Lifetime Original Holiday Special. I have an abnormally high tolerance for cheesy movies. I love good stories and I can handle a bad movie if it spins an entertaining yarn. WW84 feels like it was written in 1984. Every thing was top notch, but the story just fell on its face over and over like a YouTube Epic Fail video. The actors did a great job, and they are all fantastic in their professions, but next time, hire writers who actually have experience telling a good story. Try giving Brandon Sanderson or Patrick Rothfuss a call and ask for pointers."

I first saw her in that Fast and Furious movie and I thought that's the last we'll see of her because Gina Carrano was way way better.
Needless to say, she seems to have some backing in the industry that's why she's survived so long. I guess this proves talent matters.

","First of all, I enjoyed the first Wonder Woman and after watching the trailer for WW84, I was really excited about this movie!
OMG what did I just watch!! This has to be one of the worst DC movies ever released, no joke! All the bad reviews are correct. I'm not going to tell people not to watch it because they will anyway but please do not pay to watch it! Watch it on a free streamed platform instead.
Also I'm not going to put any spoilers in this review, not that I would be spoiling anything! but after watching 2.5 hours of this complete mess, I just had to write to say how Patty Jenkins has destroyed the WW franchise! I couldn't understand how this movie turned out so bad as she directed the first movie but later read that she also wrote the script for this movie and this is where the problem is! Gal Gadot is a great wonder woman but unfortunately she had nothing to work with here, Kristen Wiig and Pedro Pascal were villains from the Batman and Robin era movies, I could not take them seriously and they came across as weak! Not that there was much action in the movie, just sentimental, over emotional rubbish messages throughout.
I have no idea how this script got past into production, DC must think their fans are stupid and they can release any old rubbish and people will go to watch.
And to all the people rating this as one of the best movies they've seen, shame on you! You obviously have some sort of financial incentive to do with DC, I've read reviews from top reviewer's giving this a 10 which is completely laughable! and they're obviously on the DC payroll.
I want to say that Patty Jenkins you suck! Filling this movie with messages that all men are evil with the exception of Chris Pine, who should never have been in the movie anyway! You should be sued for producing this horrendous garbage!
To the powers who control DC, please do not put this mad woman in charge of WW3 or any other big DC blockbuster!"

","WW84 delivers entertainment. This time the story is set in 1984, where Wonder Woman tries to save the world once again from an unlikely enemy while she still seems to be thinking about Chris Pine. Yes, its a more emotional approach to a superhero and yes its more focused to a woman's perspective but I liked it for what it is. Runtime stands at 2,5h which might be a bit long but the pace of the film is good, so it does not get boring. The visuals and FX are pretty good throughout the movie and the action scenes are well crafted. The cast is excellent-Pedro Pascal is a highlight- and Gal Gadot is stunning once again. Kirsten Wiig is also a great addition to the film but the development of her character could have been more in depth so we can see her transformation being more justified. On the contrary, the character of Pedro Pascal is well developed and layered and I was impressed by the tension that he adds in the entire film. I was happy to see him switching between drama and comedy and many points go to him for keeping the film's pace interesting.
Style focus is excellent (80s extravaganza) and the overall meaning of the movie is somwehat positive. 8/10 very entertaining film."

I am not knocking the excellent Gal Gadot and Kristen Wiig, they can only work with the script given to them, both actors gave excellent performances with a script written by children.

","Pretty much everything about this movie is cringe. The Chris Pine's cashed in acting performance. The Donald Trump transformed wishing rock villian (yes, exactly). The uselessness of Cheetah. The Ronald Reagan impersonator. The lack of actual Wonder Woman scenes. The terrible script. The cheesy cgi. The reversal of everything that Donald wrought. Honestly, I can't think of what the positives are in this. The 9 and 10 rating reviews either didn't actually see the film or they're on drugs. There's no other explanation. I wish this movie sent into the dustbin of forget. I won't be rescinding."
202," Boring...
",Just can't feel any emotions what they were trying to show. Action sequences are not eye catching. I just don't understand why the producers of wonder woman 1984 made this film...really disappointed.
203," Way too cheesy and poorly written
",Critics must get paid off for these glowing reviews because this movie sent all the wrong messages. Where did the classy and empowered Wonder Woman go? So many plot holes and lazy writing. I hate how the studios have to ruin amazing stories.
204," Not a smart plot
","It's a simple plot about a stone that can grant your wish.. Then one guy, Max took it too far and asks for too much.. The wishes become more and more silly.. First he asked to be the stone itself then he asked for oil in his acres of land.. then he went all the way to Egypt to see the ruler there just to get more oil.. Then suddenly he wants to be more powerful than the president and then he wants to absorb health and energy from everyone...Lots of silly things in between like WW suddenly can make a plane become invisible.. She only succeed to do so with a mug before.. And just for a short time..and why max didn't ask for a better health earlier.. And why Barbara turned into a silly not so great cheetah like creature when she wishes to be number 1 and powerful?So in the end Max did not need to physically touch everyone but the signal broadcast is enough for the wishes to work? How he is so sure about that when the writings on the stone stated you have to touch it to make your wishes come true.. In all the movie becomes too messy and dragged towards the end..Gal Gadot is great in this movie but it is not enough to save the silly messy plot"
205," Really dumb story...
","I am shocked how well received this movie was on IMDB and RT. Wonder Woman was a well made, well written and well acted movie, but WW84 is really dumb. It would be fine if it is ""entertaining mindless fun"" type of dumb, but it is the ""I don't care what happens on screen anymore"" type of dumb.Dialogue made me cringe many times, many of the character arcs, connections and emotions are not believable. Everything felt forced and fake, where the characters uttered implausible lines only because they are on the script. The actors gave their best to made the clunky story work. It feels like the director was more keen to create an expensive spectacle this time, instead of tell a good story about the character."
206," All Around Terrible
","Starting with terrible choice in villains, followed by terrible casting and ending with a non sensical plot resulted in a dreadful movie. Starting with a flashback about Diana cheating and not being ready to win which had zero relevance to the rest of the plot, movie turns into a whiny Diana for 3/4 of the movie. Some plot points make no sense (why was Steve in another persons body and not just a reincarnated version of himself) and Kristen Wigg is more suited as a comedian than a supposed menacing villain. The ending makes no sense with Diana communicating to the world somehow. Would not recommend this movie to anybody."
207," If Lifetime made a Hero Movie
","This was awful! Sappy, and didnt make any sense. I'm so sick of the ""I'm nothing without a man"" story line. Dont spend money to see it."
208," Just When You Think It's Bad... It Gets Worse
","Let me start by saying that I love long movies. There's more time for character development, more time for subplots to emerge, and more time to ratchet up the tension. Sadly, WW84 uses its bloated 2.5 hour runtime to achieve none of these things.WW84 is a textbook example of everything wrong with DC's post Dark Knight Trilogy attempts to make a halfway decent superhero movie. Remember what made the Dark Knight trilogy good? Likeable heroes and villains who were well-developed, had real human motivations, and you could understand why they were doing what they were doing. Heroes are more than just a vehicle for the writers to word-vomit hours of trope-infested dialogue about ""truth"" and ""greed"" and ""humanity"" that somehow made it into the final script. And more importantly, villains should be human (not inanimate objects like stones...)And can someone tell me, why is it that these nitwits can't write a script without escalating the stakes to world-ending, cringe-inducing clichés like FULL SCALE NUCLEAR WAR?! It's ridiculous and laughable. Zero tension because we simply don't care.After an enjoyable first 15 minutes, WW84 was a complete disappointment. It will be remembered as yet another DC hatchet-job that will... somehow... still manage to turn a profit because 14 year olds (and their grown-up intellectual peers) will find anything with explosions in it entertaining."
209," Well that was disappointing
","After a long wait, meh. Long and simultaneously boring this is a parable that is so weak it calls on the parable that fostered it. Read The Monkey's Paw and save your time and money.Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman is no longer a goddess, she's a blubbering teenager. Weak in character not just in strength. Wiig's Minerva is alternately self loathing and people loathing with none of the humour or gravitas that Wiig is capable of. While there is a pointed shot at beauty replacing truth, this film is a fashion show fixated on clothing and shoes for goodness sake. Hardly empowering in any way and failing to leverage Gadot's capabilities instead turning her into a Barbie doll. Yes she is beautiful but she is more than just a pretty face. Pascal's Maxwell Lord is so one dimensional it destroys his good work in the Mandalorian. Pine comes back to inhabit the body of ""handsome man"" but we don't see much of the actual handsome man played by Kristoffer Pohala ( a major step backward in his career). Pine plays the same character as he always does whether Steve Trevor or James Kirk.The golden armour is just another wardrobe change and it does not hold up very well considering it was crafted to stop the rampage of man.We get to see the Invisible Jet but Wonder Woman cannot pilot it. She can fly now but I saw her fly in other movies so huh? She can also lasso lightning bolts and cast the Lasso of Truth forward to catch nothing and then drag her along at great speed. How does something attached to nothing generate pull? Why does air in her face make her blink continuously. Wonder Woman is extremely powerful yet she blinks in the wind?This film makes Batman v Superman look great which is tragic since Wonder Woman was the best part of that smoking hole in the ground. Bring back that feisty warrior goddess and send this one back to the dressing room along with all the costumes.The best part is the post credits scene with Lynda Carter. And that makes the film overall just sad"
210," What was that!!??
","An hour+ of very boring obvious story and chucking in some comic references then 20 mins of a 'finale' which was lacking, the villain stand off was 4 mins at best and then the speech just so wishy-washy. I love DC and have defended every film as so many people bad mouth them but this i can't defend it was just so very bad. Sorry DC but you can do better"
211," So unexpectedly bad I had to write a review
","I think of all the disappointments 2020 has given us, this might be the biggest. Considering the same team gave us the frankly superb Wonder Woman back in 2017, how did they get it so catastrophically wrong this time? I can't think of a single redeeming feature for this movie, it really was awful. The script was utterly senseless, the acting was laughably wooden, the CGI was handled by the same team who did Halle Berry's Catwoman and the costume department seems to have had lessons in wig making at Maurys Wigs! They missed a massive trick by not having an 80's soundtrack which begs the question - why set it in the 80's? There was no coherence to the writing at all, with bizarre decisions taken by characters who actually seemed more like parodies of the people they were playing. Oh and talking of parodies, why was Chris Pine playing a parody of himself playing his character from This is War playing Captain Kirk? Yes, that's how confusing the script must have been for the actors! Oh hang on, whilst I've been writing this I thought of a single redeeming feature - Kristin Wigs comedic timing. But that's really a given by now right?"
212," Unnecessarily long and boring.
","Very stupid and disappointing..
It lacks creativity, intelligence, imagination and respect for fans/ consumers..
It's filled with pointless misguided fanservice
And has no entertaining qualities..
The 150 min runtime felt like 300 min..
I've re-watched the first WW movie about half a dozen times.. I will never re-watched this abomination"
213," Purely waste of time
",Never have I watch a movie that is so boring as this one. I wish I can unwatch this.
214," Bad, bad, bad or even worse
","The first one was a decent movie but this looks as if a bunch of people wrote the first ideas that came to their head and then took a camera. There is no respect for the intelligence or the time of the viewers. I know this is a superhero movie and not the godfather but asking for a minimum of effort to entertain us without treating us like idiots is not asking too much. I wrote 2 stars because of the special effects. That's why some actors are above others. It is not only the acting abilities, Di Caprio, Washington, Cruise, Pitt, Hanks and a lot more really try to appear in decent movies. You can try to make a lot of money in this industry while keeping some respect for the people who watch the films. This movie definitely does not. I do not remember if this is the worst superhero movie I have seen but if it's not it surely is very very close. Not everyone has the talent to make movies with the quality of the dark knight or Watchmen but come on this is closer to a parody than a real hero movie. I really think that the guys from scary movie would do something better than this. Doing this film is not doing your job well, period. I respect the actors but they shouldn't have signed up for this. Come on, you cannot be the mandalorian and then appear here. Gal Gadot is a beautiful woman but she must do some real roles to become an actress and really get rid of Wonder Woman forever. Terrible movie."
215," 80's made for tv super hero movies were better
","Physics of the special effects were typical DC level of horrible.
Little plot holes all over, like in the mall robbery scene. Bad guys go into back room trusting no one will run or call the police. This is one example.
Just a lame duck of a movie."
216," Oh dear!
","Where do I begin, with a film set in mid 80s there was so much scope for nostalgia, yet this film is completely devoid. No cool 80s tracks or anything else to connect with the time period other than a poke at the era's clothing and references to cold war.Cinematics seem sub par and lacks the polished quality of the 1st film. Storyline is atrocious and should've been trashed, really seems like the garbage superhero films from decades ago. Acting is terrible all round and even Gal appears far too serious and struggles to deliver, other characters are just plain awful. If you want a good villain look to Michael Keaton's Vulture, these are just terrible in comparison.A huge missed opportunity and complete car crash of a movie."
217," Underwhelming
","Hint to studio types...actually get a good story,,,you'd be surprised at how often this works. I can literally see the studio exec, with dollar signs in his eyes say ""Set it in the 80's...Stranger Things did and they are raking it in"". This film has little to do with the 80's, plot holes the size of a bus and poor writing. A waste of 2.5 hours."
218," WW1984 is so bad...
","...the ""Deleted Scenes"" section of the BluRay version should include the entire movie again."
219," Disappointing
","This film was surprising and not in a good way, it feels very pieced together and rushed. The pacing was terrible, in most of the movie you are waiting for something to happen, and in the rest of it you are watching mediocre CGI. This film could have been shorter and more engaging, there was a lot of buildup for Cheetah (Kristen Wiig) and it wasn't needed. I was excited to watch this and honestly it was a massive letdown. The only good thing about this movie was Gal Ghe did the most she could do with what she was given. Overall, I don't recommend this film."
220," So disappointing!
","Absurd plot made this movie a waste of time.
It started out nicely with Diana as a young girl. After this point it just went downhill with silly plot that seemed written just to be able to have Chris Pine in the movie."
221," Wondering who wrote this story
",Feels like watched God tussi great ho again but with the better CGI
222," Bring some crackers, its gonna get cheesy!
","As much as I don't disagree with the 1 start raters too much, this was pretty awful but at the same time I've seen much worse films so instead it gets a 3. The dialogue was written by a soap opera aficionado and the plot by someone on crack. Gadot delivers it as well as anyone could and I might forgive her more if she wasn't listed as a producer... meaning she had the power to say ""cmon, this script is horrendous!""
Still, there were a couple of iconic Wonder Woman reveals that I enjoyed enough to get it 3 stars.. especially the mid credit scene."
223," Don't waste your time.
",This is rubbing shoulders with Mulan on the worst-case side of widely anticipated movies. The plot was extremely wayward and convuluted. The second half was a total drag and didn't add any value to the story at all. Most of the characters were wasted because of the pointless main plot.The only reason I gave 3 stars is because of GG's acting and Pine's cameo and an ok-ish first half.
224," Its a wonder how boring it was
","Two hours I won't be getting back. The story is so bland it makes white bread look interesting. And it doesn't help that the actress playing Wonder Woman can't emote and is average at best. The story drags on and on and the action is minimal at best. Some of the scenes are cringeworthy like this is 2020 and it looks like it was shot in the 1990s behind a green screen using Windows 98. It rivals Tom Cruise riding down the ""storm"" bad. If you're bored... skip it. If you have anything to do? Skip it. If you're very very bored? Skip it. The drive to the theater will be more exciting than this movie. Flipping through HBO Max to find this movie will bring more entertainment than actually watching it. I saw a free screening and still felt wasted."
225," One star for Gal Gadot, two stars for Chris Pine
","Ok, Patty hasvofficially messed up two DC movies. Tenet has more storytelling and character development in 5 minutes than WW84 in its first 40 minutes. Christ, I almost thought Pine would pull this Titanic off the deep end. JL was 100x better than this nuttsack of a movie."
226," Gal Gadot is so beautiful
","Rated 2 star is because of the beauty of Gal Gadot. Without it, I wouldn't bear to watch the movie till the end. Feel like it's a fail from DC movies"
227," laughable
","This movie is sadly ridiculous.
I want to start form the monkey paws element:
Diana, you are in a movie with actual gods and the artefact that drives your story is a 20th century reference? You had a chance to bring in some trickster god from the maya and you ended up with what seemed to be presented from the executive producer of nickelodeon: instead of that book you checked you would have fared better in having spongebob to explain the extremely convenient tip to solve the impasse of your plot.
Because the way that the wish can be renounced is unbearably silly; it does no represent any actual sacrifice, Diana does not have to kill her love or him love killing himself; just the formula would do, which seems to be coming from an advertisement of underwear with the message 'you better change them eventually'.
This intersects with the other main problem of the movie: the representation of male and female dependency. Diana is an heroine that just needs her lover to give himself away to improve her power. I think this idea was profoundly explored in Digimon. Luckily enough he is always the same guy otherwise the stereotype of the famme fatale would be rewritten for a more dangerous woman that will eventually extinguish the male population by the sheer power of kindness.
I wish it was possible to discuss the movie without thinking it a statement for social issues but the blessed times of 9os are over and now everything is as good as the single idea that must be preserved and behind the string of words there is actually no space to feel any living presence of intellect.
The Chinese fortune cookies have less pretentiousness but equal creed.
The movie acknowledges that there can be only woman fullness in loving, furthermore one who has a good sense of clothing in case he is not your reincarnated lost boyfriend (anyway: thank you for having again chirs pyne- it made so much easier to forget that you were actually triyins to say that the beauty is inside- gadot's rocky accent never would have allowed to play serious on that).
And then the naivetés on plots and social issues climax in the most unforgivable sin: I can t forgive the movie to misuse the line of Keats 'beauty is truth, truth is beauty and that is all there is' to get rid it of its ambiguity for the sake of the supposedly powerful message (which more seemed and afterthought after they had forgotten why Diana in eagle armour should be more that just a way to presents Gadot's hips swinging). The line of keats plays on tautology to create an element of beauty in imagination that is not actually written down in the sentence; the line creates the beauty of its subject by refereeing to it without exhausting it in actual representation. Wonder woman, by having the ecstatic diana whispering 'the truth is beautiful' enters in the field of its own ineptitude by revealing that it has no notion of how debatable the concept of truth is. Not that a movie had to solve ontological problem that still titillate philosophers but a certain capacity to recognize that truth had never movie's concern would have bben welcomed ( indeed, coming form a French school of reasoning, desire is the constitutive element of truth,, therefore the truth to be contemplated had always been equally beautiful, before and after the claim that renunciation is the emerging nature of truth , Why do you remain selctive on the truth you fancy, Diana?)"
228," just awful
",Really enjoyed the 1st ww movie. ww 1984 was beyond bad.
229," Don't waste your time
","Poor story line, great actors and actresses on the cast but they ain't for this morning. Story line beside the first island scene is just dreadful to watch."
230," Truly awful
","The first was so so hero film which passed muster barely. This mess made that film look like a masterpiece.
Plot holes galore, horrific acting and soooooo long.
I did give an extra point for using some CGI equipment from the original Jaws movie. Hilarious

232," FULL SPOILERS ARE IN THIS REVIEW
","Today I'm going to pitch you a Batman movie.
If you don't like Batman, just replace him with your favorite superhero and ask yourself what's wrong with you.
Imagine a Batman movie where you get 10 mins of flashbacks to his childhood.
Then you get 10 mins of Batman action.
Then you get 25 (TWENTY FIVE) minutes of Bruce Wayne moping around about how dead his dead girlfriend is.
Then Bruce Wayne makes a wish for his girlfriend to come back and you get to watch ANOTHER HALF HOUR of Bruce Wayne and his girlfriend walking around the museum and watching fireworks and going to bed together. A few minutes of Joker setup happens in the background.
Then you are finally rewarded with 4 more minutes of Batman being Batman
Only to be sucked back in to 20 more minutes of Bruce Wayne hanging out with his girlfriend, arguing with his girlfriend, reading books with his girlfriend. A few more minutes of Joker setup happen in the background.
Another 4 minute gift of Batman doing actual Batman stuff.
But then Batman tells his zombie girlfriend that he can't hang out with her anymore cause he needs to be Batman.
Batman actually screams ""I WILL NEVER LOVE AGAIN!"" in the streets while in costume.
Queue 10 mins of villain scenes followed by TWO MINUTE fight scene the movie has been promising for the last TWO HOURS AND 10 MINUTES.
Batman then gets knocked into a corner while the Joker tries to carry out his master plan. Instead of fighting the Joker or putting a stop to anything, Batman lays in the corner and CRIES and CRIES, begging the Joker to stop doing evil cause it's hurting people. The Joker decides that Batman is right, and stops doing evil. Queue 15 mins of Joker hanging out with his son he never spent time with, all is forgiven and he faces 0 consequences.
But it's ok guys. At the end Bruce Wayne gets hit on in front of a Christmas Tree and EVEN FLIRTS BACK A BIT. He realizes that life isn't so bad after all. He has hope again. Roll Credits.
Two hours and 25 minutes of actual movie and 20~ of them are Batman in costume being Batman.
This movie was trash. Possibly the most expensive trash I've ever watched. Legitimately one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It's not ""empowering"" for anyone, not even the characters in the movie. It's not inspiring. It fails in every single way to be anything close to a mediocre movie.
0/10"
233," What a disappointment
","I was looking forward to watching this movie since the first WW movie was so amazingly good! Unfortunately, this movie felt like a low budget super hero parody. Did the actors have no time to rehearse? What happened to the chemistry between Gadot and Pine? Why all the silly, corny, cheesy scenes? Where was the grit? The acting was so bad, it felt like the film was actually their first rehearsal.
I literally only enjoyed the first 5 min intro scene that shows Diana as a child. But that seemed like an entirely different movie. Not sure how it even tied into the movie. It's like the whole movie just glued separate scenes together. I regret watching this movie because it has tarnished the WW brand."
234," A pretty face cannot save this disastrous film.
",Where does one start to breakdown everything that is wrong with this film? How about we keep it simple: do not waste your time on this utter nonsense.The worst film I've seen in decades.
235," Terrible, slow, poor plot, poor villains and just boring.
","It took me 8 hours to get through this 150 minute mess. Cheetah was a totally useless character, bringing Chris Pine back was just weird and the entire opening scene amounted to nothing. A boring horrendous mess of a movie that makes you wonder a about the bleak future of film."
236," Easily the most disappointing movie in 2020
","Feminist (sometimes it also managed to loose that message) garbage with poor story. Every male is evil, except for her love interest. Girl empowering but she can't win without man....!!!!!What a horrible expierence."
237," What a Joke
","Movie was so dumb, Sad the first one was really good."
238," A terrible disappointment
","The first Wonder Woman movie saved the DC franchise. This one may have ended it. The actors did their best with what they were given, but the story was a joke. It made no sense, it was all over the place, and the plot holes prevented any chance for suspension of disbelief. Honestly, this should have been a direct-to-video sequel done on a tenth of the budget. DC needs to start from scratch and rebuild starting with a few solid, simple movies. It's a pity, because I really wanted to like this movie."
239," Pure disappointment
","Full lost 2.5 hours. 1 star plus for Gadot. Story may be was good on paper, but on screen in 2.5 hours just pure boredom. What's worse from cool 1984 not much to see."
240," Disappointing
",DC movies generally don't appeal to me but I loved the first Wonder Woman and hoped this would be comparable. It is not. It's a mess. I hope it's simply the result of the limitations imposed by 2020 (coronavirus) and the team can redeem themselves in the 3rd installment. Don't waste your time sitting through this.
241," Shockingly bad
",SOOOOO BAD - just everything about this movie made me cringe; from the dialogue to the action sequences. The first one was so good - so I'm extra disappointed!
242," I literally can't believe the writers chose this storyline
","This movie isn't terrible itself, as some of the actors and performance are great, but good grief, I literally couldn't believe the plot. It's like they took a $200M movie and spent $53 on the plot outline. It's cartoonish, and I mean that in the worst sense of that word, which just doesn't play with what comic book movies have become in the last decade. There are a few redeeming nuggets here and there, but early on you can see the general plot and it's hard to not just eye roll or even stare in disbelief that they would go this route with this movie that had so much anticipation."
243," Please skip this movie
","There was no emotion in the movie..it was all flat.
The opening race has nothing to do with the movie except for one dialogue about truth. No gripping action sequences. WW vs Cheetah fight is so bad. WW losing her powers is so subtly shown that most people would completely miss it. Too much unrelated chaos in the movie. Completely illogical at times."
244," Phony baloney.
","I don't mind the premise of 1984, it's just executed poorly.Has a promising start, but deteriorates the further along. It's basically all phony baloney, a lot like the Spider-Man film I watched the other day, along with Pascal ruining everything he touches."
245," Waste of time
",Worst DC movie ever. Don't watch even if you have a lot of free time.
246," Embarrassingly rubbish
","I can not understand what happened! Absolutely loved the first one, this one was atrocious. Bad acting, rubbish storyline and the 'special effects' were shocking.
What a total waste of time. Please do not waste yours, or your money."
247," So Disappointing.
","After reading a few reviews in the press I was kind of looking forward to see what the 'WW' franchise had dished out, as many critics were giving it high marks 4-5 stars.
After watching this way too long movie I was disappointed, virtually nothing happens for half the film, and the writing and script is just bad.
Expect lots of frowning from 'Gal Gadot' and a really poor baddie whose power is granting wishes, c'mon!!
At least the first movie was kind of unique for a female lead role with powers and was watchable even though the bad guy in that was kind of lame too, at least the setting of World War I era was engaging, but this movie is too long and so full of plot holes and continuity errors, how could they get this one so wrong?"
248," So so bad
","Can't remember when was the last time I saw such a bad movie, weak storyline"
249," They threw the franchise in the trash!!
","A bad story with exaggerated time's characterizations, bad interpretations and lack of orignality!!!"
250," A real fall from grace
",The first Wonder Woman movie was a very successful movie and proves that you can give someone who didn't have much credit in the movie world a push and make the actress a star. That's what happened for Gal Gadot who played Wonder Woman.But Wonder Woman 1984 is undoubtedly a example of how a sequel can disappoint in so many levels it falls under the sequel curse.I won't give anything away out of respect to those who haven't seen it yet.Like many I had been expecting to see this movie due to many unfortunate events the movie kept on getting delay and delay. Now that it finally came out it has been a total disaster. You would think that they would take the time to make the movie better but nope this movie fell miserablyThe writing makes absolutely no sense as the story couldn't make sense if it was written for a video game and I have seen video games with better stories than this movie.The acting in the movie just feels weak.You would think after a successful movie they would make a sequel even better but nope this movie isn't worth the film it was recorded withThere are only a few things about this movie that I would have appreciatedOverall Wonder Woman 1984 is a sequel that needed more time in the ovenI give Wonder Woman 1984 an 3 out of 10
251," 151 waisted minutes. Spend your time doing anything else.
",Another DUD. Story F. Special effects for WW F. WW character F. Who is approving the production of this series????
252," Silly and stupid
","Waste of time
Really in 2020 they made like this movie
The wings of ww was a bad idea as they mentioned it was made of worriers armor not a technology wings were it can be controlled by mind
Also a plane were become invisible in 84 it was stupid
The slow motion as usual and the camera on ww face also bad
The graphics was bad specially when she saved the 2 children in Egypt thats a disaster
The storyline also bad
I wish if there is ratings by negative"
253," Nothing special. Don't waste over two hours of your time..
","I don't wanna spoil it, but the movie is just the predictable fairly tale kind. No climax in any part. Just the normal super hero comes in and save the day crap. Even the villian is not really a villian. How is that even possible??? I never expected anything captivating from DC but this beats my unexpected expectations."
254," Weak plot weaker story and weakest action
",I think it is more like celebration of the character Wonder Woman than the telling of the story. 3 star is only because of Gal Gadot being Wonder Woman. She is breathtakingly beautiful and marvellous in few scenes especially while she tries to fly in the sky. What was most disappointing was the action sequences. The story was bogus altogether and director seems to be not in sync with the whole movie. After all it is director's job to tell the story. Waste of money and waste of time. Half of the time I was yawning out of boredom. Go if you want to see beautiful Gadot on silver screen. She is charismatic. The other actors have done their part but sadly there was nothing in the story line. The fight between WW and Cheetah could have been better and satisfying but was a waste. Alas!
255," Cheesy
","A few fight scenes were pretty good, every thing else was ""cheesy "" what a waste of money!!!"
256," Had Potential But Missed Its Mark
","Wonder Woman 1984 had poor CGI, poor storytelling, and poor sound bits. DC should have stopped after the 1st Wonder Woman Movie which was amazing. The 1st Wonder Woman Movie, Man of Steel, and the Dark Knight Trilogy are the only good movies DC has made thus far."
257," Painful
",Perfect dumpster fire end to a perfect dumpster fire of a year. Why in the world did the actors not jump ship?
258," What a disappointment!
","I didn't know the movie was leaving everyone with such a bad experience before I went to watch this. I should have read the reviews first. I have already wasted more than 2 hours of my life watching this garbage, I don't want to waste some more writing a detailed review. All I can say is, this movie is going to go down in history as one of the worst super hero movies ever in history."
259," Complete Waste of Time
","If their goal was to make one of the worst movies ever, then they succeeded admirably. Has to be the worst script and story I've seen in a long time. Complete waste of 2 1/2 hours."
260," Bad
","Quite bad, wasn't expecting much, still disapointed. Physicts.. omg, just took me out of the movie, no idea what they were trying to do with those lasso scenes. Get that Diana catched a jumbo jet from like few kilometers with her lasso and used it as a slinghshot, they casualy spider-maned using lightings, yea thsoe in sky. I dont care if that happend in the comic, it looked werid and bothered me a lot, probably because of the poor writing I haven't had any interest in the story."
261," Another DC Let Down
","The original Wonder Woman was one of very few DC movies I have enjoyed, but WW1984 fell flat on its face. We were almost an hour into the movie and wondering if it was a drama or a super hero movie. The writers again failed another DC movie. My daughter loved the first Wonder Woman she became her hero but after watching this she also left disappointed. The story line was awful and drawn out. The movie was slow. The action scenes lacked in many ways. Wonder Woman 1984 like most other DC movies left us disappointed. Thankfully this time it wasn't for language, and darkness like most DC movies have been doing but just the story line alone where the writers almost always seem to fail our loved super heroes. I don't foresee us watching this movie too any more times."
262," Awful
","I don't know what these people were thinking, the first movie was awesome, no complaints there, this movie has so many plot holes, I'm so glad I didn't waste money at the movie theater to see this garbage, do not waste your money or time with this"
263," For a moment I thought it might be good
","Nothing about this movie makes sense. Rules are established for no reason and broken just as easily. The movie is set in 1984 for absolutely no reason. It actually ends up being non-canonical because they completely forgot they were supposed to be keeping WW a secret halfway through the movie. Just like the first movie, this movie ends in CGI nonsense. The longer I think about this movie the more I have to ask ""but why?"" about every plot point in this movie. And saying that there was a plot in this movie is being generous."
264," Fits perfectly into the DC movie franchise so far...
","Wonder Woman was the one movie that stood out in the DC franchise, because it was actually very good. This film dosn't live up to that. The pacing is off, the action is lack lustre. The characters arr nonsensical and most importantly there is a weird obcession with Wonder Womans lasso. She can't do anything without using the lasso. Overall it felt like a budget film with stiff uncomfortable performances from otherwise great actors."
265," What a Disappointment :-(
","Given the triumph that 2017's Wonder Woman was, I have been eagerly awaiting the release of this film.I have rarely been more disappointed by a sequel.I had written a long review, but I can sumarise it thusly:Story: OK in parts.
Script: Laughable.
Acting: They do their best with what they're given.
CGI: Embarassing.If you liked the awful mess that was 'Aquaman' then you might like this too. But if you are a reasonable person, don't bother.It's bad. Really bad. And not in a good way :-("
266," Not a DC movie
","This doesn't feel like a DC movie at all. This movie is for kids. So many things went wrong. The only thing which feels 1984 is the graphics. Chris pine is the only silver lining. When people were complaining that DC movies are ""Dark"", they tried something different with the first part but they stretched it too much with the second."
267," Don't waste two and a half hours of your life watching this!
","I knew that I would have to park half of my brain to watch this. But that was fine for a festive chillout...But oh it is diabolical nonsense. Chris Pine, you must be regretting this!? I only gave it a ""1"" because that is the minimum possible to rate it. Truly awful, right from the start it wreaks of over exaggeration with non-non-science that would makes me start to believe unicorns might actually exist given the relativity of the facts. ooh I must stop here, my stomach is churning..."
268," A total disappointment
","A completely lazy follow-up to a great movie - a convoluted plot that strains the bounds of credulity (even for a superhero movie), bad CGI, and blatant anachronisms that could have been checked with a simple Google search."
269," I HAVE NEVER SEEN A WORSE MOVIE
","This is my first movie review and I've seen a lot of movies, the plot made no sense"
270," Since when sexual violation is ok?
","The movie didn't live up to its hype, and as a matter of fact it is rotten movie with a wrapped morality.As movie insinuates, it is perfectly alright to sleep with a complete stranger, without his explicit consent, as long as your dead boyfriend's soul is in him. Perhaps, there's a word for it. In any case, release a movie with gender roles reversed in this age and see a cesspool, known as twitter, go all crazy. Imagine if Superman did this in a story directed by a man and written by a man; Lois Lane's soul in some poor random chick and Superman is sleeping with her. Later at the end of the moving, smiling, flirting and exchange pleasantries with her minus Lois' soul while she has absolute no recollection of what happened to her. The internet cesspool, known as twitter, would face a meltdown. Feminists and people, who are applauding this movie with sheer enthusiasm, would be out of their woodwork and asking for director's head.The aforementioned dead boyfriend, who flew and died in a prop aircraft can fly a Tornado aircraft without even glancing at checklist. I presume there's some upgrade when you're resurrected.
People are going to make a right choice at the end as depicted in the movie? Is there's someone naive enough to believe it. Didn't 2020 teach you anything?Those people who loved this movie can be sold shares in MLM scheme."
271," Boring!
","I was expecting an action movie from a DC hero, and what i got is a drama/romance with a litle bit of action. The plot is awefull, the scrip is bad, the action scenes are average- , its a really bad movie. I enjoyed the first one, but this was really bad."
272," Isn't possession usually a bad thing?
","Nothing new to add , this is just a terrible movie on every level. Plot and character development non existent, dialogue inane, plausibility even for a SH movie zero, I could go on and on but why? Save yourself 2.5 hours of meaningless drivel and do anything else. It's a real shame because I really liked the first one."
273," Reviews are true. Believe them
","I watched it first day, before reading any reviews, so I went in with a fresh mind. But sadly, came out with a frustrated mind. This is campy, in the worst possible way."
274," Wasted movie
","Absolutely terrible movie. Do not waste your time. Bad story, bad plot. Nothing made sense. Loved the first one, this was horrible."
275," Snore fest galore for 2.5 hours!
","I found the movie cheesy. There is a light tone to everything, which hurts the immersion in the movie.Even the villain is kind of ridiculous and not credible.Also the movie is 2.5h long, the story is slow and rags for more than half of the movie. And when the action starts it is really low quality."
276," one word-disaster!
","Dont even start watching,it wont get better, two and a half hours of nothing, bad acting, plot even worst, total disapointment, i dont know who gave money for production but i feel sorry for them, one of the worst blockbusters ever,even netflix make better movies.
Only, and i mean really ONLY good thing in this movie is that Gal is so beautiful and thats it...."
277," So bad
","Predictable, new superpowers popping up with no decent explanation or purpose. Forced. Defies logic thinking. It's not JUST because it has women staring that you will get good reviews. The whole stupid love story to drive women's sacrifice couldn't be less feminist. Cheetah became evil with no explanation and represents women just being jealous of each other."
278," I wish this film never happened
","OMFG, it was so bad. It was beyond bad. It was one of the biggest cringe festivals I ever witnessed. No plot, it is clear Jenkins couldn't come up with a decent script. Why did the studio approve it. You should not able to destroy something you built in the first film this quick. But she did that exactly. All these young talented screenwriters, directors, it really is a shame."
279," Don't waste your time and money on 1984..go back and see the 1st One.
","I loved the original Wonder Woman and also liked Wonder Woman in Justice League. And I think Gal Gadot is generally a great actress and someone with an excellent sense of self humor and timing.But this movie is just so bad that it is hard to begin. Starts with terrible casting, the cheesy script, acting that seemed wooden, plotline that is just lazy. The ending to this movie seems like the script writers said, ok, I'm tired of working on this movie and I already got paid, so let's just wrap it up with a stupid, non-sensical finish that makes no sense.My friends invited us to watch on Apple TV and I was amazed that they had to pay nearly $30 for this movie to rent. What a total, waste of money that was!! This movie belongs in the $0.99 DVD clearance bin at the local store."
280," Cliche
","Nothing original here, just the classic tropes that we all know and hate. The actors did their best with the awful script they were given. The pace was all over the place and the comedy didn't hit like it should have. I actually fell asleep and had to come back to finish the movie. Bad writing, bad directing, bad editing, decent acting."
281," Hollywood at its best
","I don't know why we expect better quality movies. This is a movie at par with what the critics rate ""excellent"". I would trust the user reviews over the critics any day. At least I didn't have to go to the theaters to watch this garbage fest."
282," Now we know why they released this on HBO Max...
","Such a disappointment! Where to begin?1. Lazy writing. Let's just throw WW and Cheetah in the Monkey's Paw story and see what happens... ""Even though we are going to mention it in our story, we hope no one notices that we copy it.""
2. Predictable plot. Foreshadowing is one thing, knowing exactly what is going to happen from one scene to the next, boring...
3. Mediocre acting. What in the world was the crying scene with Gal Gadot? Was that suppose to be sad or funny, because watching her, I couldn't help but chuckle.
4. Effects were an absolute joke! Just because the movie was supposed to be set in 1984, doesn't mean the movie effects needed to be.
5. Way too drawn out. This should have been edited down to about an hour and half.Honestly, maybe I had too high hopes for this movie, based on the first one. This seems to be a bit more in line with the other DC movies... maybe even worse!"
283," Mostly awful...
","It was a wet afternoon in a nearly empty cinema on the south coast of England. The character build up was quite good, but when the story got going it was all downhill. Cheesy story line, and over the top effects. Make sure you stay after the closing credits, that scene was the highlight of the movie for me."
284," Rest in pease.
","How wonderful was the first WonderWoman, so bad is the second movie. Lack of action, a lot of unneccesary drama, weak anthagonist, strange changes in WW character and actions, and total boring and stupidity....
I start looking at my watches after 1 hour of movie, on the 2nd hour I am start thinking of leaving cinema...
The only one thing is good in that movie - Pedro Pascal's acting"
285," Shot and acted like a parody movie!!
","Actors at its worst. Logic, physics basics are all wrong..!! I've heard the lady director complaining about getting paid less compared to others, I wish she just realize how pathetic is her movie.
Never seen such a disastrous movie in the whole COVID time.
Bad script, bad story, bad direction, bad acting even the graphics is kind of a joke.Don't wast time on this movie, better watch something else."
286," 2.5 hours too long.
","Man, as a big fan of the comic books, this pretty much fell flat as every possible avenue.Did DC learn nothing from Superman IV.You have a wealth of comic book history and you choose the lazy doppelgänger storyline?And who the hell thought Kristen Wiig was a good choice? The woman cannot act. She can pretty much only do 'awkward'. She can't do villainous and she definitely can't do femme fatale.Pedro Pascal was completely wasted in this movie.Hopefully they won't make a sequel."
287," Messy, clunky, far fetched.
",Where do I start. First film for 10 months and I was disappointed.Where to start...The story line. Oh gosh.... so random and far fetched. What was the 10 minute fireworks display all about? And some fuel in the fighter jet going all the way to Egypt. Not to mention the random new invisibility skill Oh yeah a ww2 fighter pilot can suddenly fly a fighter jet. Yeahhhhh what a load of nonscience.WW can fly based off a conversation.... yeahhhhhhRubbish. Other that aquaman DC are no way near Marvel.
288," What happened,
","I rarely write a review but after the first Wonder Woman and the director doing such a great job I really thought what I was reading could not be a bad as they say. Well they were right, I tried so hard to like this, but it was overall terrible. The story was so badly executed and over long it just made the experience more painful. When it finally ended it was a relief! Patty good luck getting another gig!"
289," Such a third class movie
","Totally a 1 star movie movie. dc really disappointed this time
Movie's story is so bad that in the end you will really feel that you wasted your 2.5 hours.
Only thing which is good in the movie is gal gadot
Dont know how these makers even make stories like these and no one from the team also objects."
290," Dont waste your time with this
",It took real effort to finish this movie after stopping it once before. This is supposed to be a super hero action movie. What you get is a trying way too hard world peace feel good movie where WW is weak af. The actors try hard and pedro is a great actor but a terrible casting choice for this movie.
291," So so bad
","Extremely predictable the whole time. Super lazy scripting, unrealistic events (planes have infinite gasoline?) and even bad special effects.Pedro Pascal's acting is the only good thing of this movie. First time I saw him in a role like this and he did a great job."
292," Absolute Chaos.
","Being a good director does NOT mean being a capable storyteller/screenwriter. No fault of the actors, this story and script was a bunched up carpet, riddled with holes. A rushed telling with a timeline that doesn't fit WW's other DCU appearances (i.e. tells Batman in current day/decades after the events in this film she ""disappeared"" and stayed hidden... not exactly what happens in 1984...) , a lazy plot device that requires absolutely no detective work by our heroine (Barbara does the one research scene and delivers all we need to know in one scene of dialogue condensed in one phone call; Diana finds the main villain almost immediately just driving on a road...), illogical/tired trope decisions transparently made for cheap reactions (Barb being a nerd complete with glasses, not being able to walk in heels and dropping things; Steve's outfit montage...), WW's powers being all over the place (she loses Steve unexpectedly and ""discovers"" her power in the first WW film and defeats Ares, the GOD OF WAR, but after revoking her wish in this film to regain her powers she can't stand her ground against the WIND created by a human who absorbed the powers of a little TRINKET another god created for kicks/laughs...), and no consequences for the main villain at the end - which completely decimates the original ""lesson"" from the beginning, about how cheating to gain what you haven't earned is... bad. The movie lost me when Steve was brought back... in another man's body. WHY. WHY? If the stone is so powerful, why couldn't it just manifest him as himself, instead of some poor dude who probably got fired for not showings up for days and got dumped by his girlfriend...etc. The way Diana and Steve just take over this person's apartment and life with no concern is strange, concerning, and completely out of character. There's so much more... Cheetah looking nothing like the comics, how much damage she was able to do to supposedly indestructible armor, no explanation of if the ENTIRE POPULATION OF THE WORLD would remember the events of this movie and if not, why/how... I'll just stop here. I heard there's a third film in the works - hope they learn from their mistakes."
293," Who gave this a 10/10? That's just wrong.
","Anyone who gave this a 10 rating should be horse whipped for being dishonest and stupid. This movie came out of the gate with over a 7.0 rating at the git-go due to insider voting. Then the movie was seen by the real people and it has constantly dropped daily down to its current 5.5 rating. And it takes a LOT of low ratings to do that. It will continue to fall as more and more poor ratings arrive which can't be offset by schills that give it a 10/10. This movie had promise. It did not live up to that promise. I touted this movie to my friends and was really let down by how poor the writing of this movie was. The 1st WW was NOT written by Patty Jenkins. This one was and it shows. What makes superhero movies good is that its a Good vs Bad plot with some character interaction and development. What we got was a women enpowerment Hallmark movie with current left side ideas sprinkled though the movie (like the ""I hate guns"" line, the police brutality in the background towards the end of the movie, the ""bad orange man"" representation by Pedro, and so on). It was just a poor excuse for what could have really been good. People have waited all year on a ""big"" movie to be released due to the constraints put on them by the virus, gov't, science and to get this piece of drivel was a kick in the b*lls. I added 1 star due to the fact that I (unlike some others) actually liked the goofy start of the movie with the little WW. Still waiting on the next ""big"" movie to come out. This one ain't it!"
294," EXTREMELY BAD MOVIE
","I'm So Mad about that 2.5 Hours that I Wasted on this Movie, and by the way... I'm Egyptian And Cairo Didn't look that way in 1984... And we have NO Princes or Oil Traders in that way in Egypt... And ""Amr Waked""... Shame on you..."
295," would give it zero if I could
",Just another piece of feminist trash of a movie. Don't even bother
296," Original title Wishmaster 1997
",The plot is horribly bad. I think the screenplay writers should resign and DC comics writers should take over.
297," Disappointment yet again
","I have never been a Gadot-fan, but how she managed to perform even lower than usual, is beyond my imagination.The first WW movie was a huge disappointment to me, and the ratings were basically based on the movie being a first female superhero movie in a long time. Now that the hype has settled, people can rate the movie based on the movie itself and not some general hype - and yes a big disappointment yet again.."
298," Warning don't watch this movie
",Wonder Woman 1984 first is the worst movie of dc unvise second is one of the worst superheroes ever there is lot of plot and the story doesn't make any sense is just a big miss waste of time and money.
299," Disappointiing
",Comparing to the first one this film is disappointing
300," Just terrible
",Batman v Superman was better than this... And it was awful.
301," Phewww! Let this 2020 end sooner😑
",Every Comic Fan after watching this movie : 'I WISH THIS MOVIE WAS NEVER RELEASED'
302," I can't believe how bad this was!
","You have to just go in and take this movie at face value - think about none of it!I wasn't able to take it at face value - there was so much wrong with it, with tone and story, it made me cringe, and peddled an idea with very little holding any of it together.I liked aspects of the end, but only, I think, because the end was better than the first 90 minutes or so.Horribly cheesy.It's quite insulting too, doesn't respect the main character, and doesn't respect it's audience.I can't bring myself to write any more about it, and have it waste even more of my time."
303," WTH!
","Jesus this movie has so many plot holes. This is by far the worst DCEU film. Nothing happens in The first 80 minutes in this film, other than Steve Trevor walking around being amused by technology and fireworks. The villain was way over the top, and every male character other than Chris pine was a dirtbag, Like just say you hate men and be done with it. The CGI was bad, and for some reason a character from the movie CATS made an appearance. This movie was a total mess and I have no idea how the critics rated this so high."
304," Holy Bat Gauna!
","EXTREMELY disappointed. Storyline was a Joke. Almost a childlike comedy but worse. Serious garbage! This will easily become one the top worst conic book hero movie of all time. I'm still upset and swearing about it after watching it 3 days ago. Seriously, WTF was this?"
305," So bad so sad !!!!
",Was really looking forward to this movie and seeing the sexy Gal Gadot as WW. The storyline is so stupid and laughable. Chris pine came back to life in another mans body. Wow !!! Really!!! And casting Kristen Wig is unbelievably bad. I want my 2 1/2 wasted hours back.
306," MacGuffin class now in session
","This was terrible. Painful. The story was stupid, the acting poor and the special effects? Oh, they were special all right."
307," Such a disappointment!
","Do not expect this to be anything like the first one. This movie removes all that makes Wonder Woman a stellar, empowered woman character. It is a cringe-worthy walk down memory lane of bad '80's outfits. It took about an hour to get to something that resembled an actual plot. Not worth the HBO subscription for that movie. So sad."
308," Not the movie I wanted.
",I'm at a loss for words. I wouldn't say not to watch it. But I would say not to get your hopes up.
309," Cheesy and The Dream Stone
","Wonder Woman starts off with her as a child dreaming to win a Olympic type tournament. Her win dies as she missed her opportunity to hit her target. Wishful thinking is the plot of this movie. Oh how that turns into a weapon of chaos.Back in the present she is alone and she truly misses Steve Trevor. However her character and demeanor is so monotone and dull. The chemistry with a dorky Barbara whose character feels cringy somehow does not mix. Max Lord is introduced and the dream stone is now part of the plot.Only when the action of the dream stone is introduced, the plot and pacing gets better. Certain things to watch out for, Wonder Woman makes the Jet invisible without the explanation is really not good, Bringing Chris Pine and showing a different man makes it confusing.Max Lord is a Man of wishful thinking and uses the stone to make him unstoppable. Sadly Cheetah isn't portray properly and her character felt more of a ""Karen"" type person. I feel this movie is disappointing and doesn't do justice. I will admit that the story of the dream stone and how it was used made me like the movie in certain scenes. How it ended, made me feel unhappy since justices wasn't done correctly."
310," Utter crap
",Nice parody/comedy movie lol... just laughable. I regret watching it.
311," Literally Speechless
","Before my short review let me say the first Wonder Woman film is one of my favourites, I saw it at a midnight showing the day it was released and loved every minute of it. So, to say I was looking forward WW84 would be an understatement...........Well let's get to WW84, what an utter piece of rubbish, who in their right mind read this script and thought, wow this sounds like a real winner, it takes everything that was good in the first movie and throws it away to be replaced be a mishmash of sentimental, claptrap, made all the worse for some of the worst CGI, ever seen in a movie. I am trying to think of anything that makes it worth watching and I just can't, its just really, really bad and that makes me incredibly sad"
312," One Word boring
",What on earth are you doing WB why there is no proper continuety in story. Its like romantic comedy more than action. Who are the script writers? 5 year olds??? Damn I feel like seeing the first part again. WW84 is garbage. TV viewing is enough for this no need for imax viewing 25% extra picture to watch what their dialogues .Dissovle this garbage franchise no continuety. Just concentrate working on batman and joker characters..CGI is so bad its laughable and Gal Gadot seriously cannot act pretty face is not everything. Stop supporting this garbage and support real acting and talent. DC died with dark knight trilogy. Only thing I like about DC for now is Henry cavill. Shazam and aquaman were good and that's about it..
313," INCREDIBLY BAD CINEMA. Worse than Justice League
","The easiest way to describe whats bad about this movie, is to just be honest and say, literally everything about this movie was bad. Gal Gadot is arguably the most beautiful woman in hollywood and she doesn't deserve this. None of the actors deserves to have this hunk of hot garbage on their resume. Didnt anyone with any amount of decent taste in film watch this movie before it was released? If this movie accomplishes anything, it'll be that it made all the other awful DC flicks seem less terrible. This made Justice League look like Dark Knight"
314," Worse than Daredevil...
","...and that is saying something, since Daredevil makes me want to stick hot pokers in my ears and gouge out my eyes. What a let down after a fantastic first movie."
315," You can't suspend disbelief enough to make sense of a lot of this
","She has invisibility magicShe learns to fly, but that's not fast enough so she swings on her lasso like Spider-Man BUT NOT FROM BUILDINGS! SHE'S SWINGING FROM LIGHTNINGCGI fights were an eyesoreThe hit you over the head ""Trumps a villain destroying the world"" motif is outdated since he losther boyfriend possesses someone else's body (and not in a they were brain dead anyway kind of way) and she doesn't seem to have any moral dilemma over that part of the deal at alland the ""you can't take shortcuts"" lesson at the beginning doesn't really come back into play. Plus it seemed more like a fight until the end rather than just sitting back and taking an L kind of lesson."
316," Wonder Colander...
",Leaking like a sieve with plot holes aplenty as Film Editing for Dummies is dispatched to the cutting room floor and the opportunity to build on the previous excellent performances becomes a bit of a blunder.
317," Unwatchable
","Even with constant (constant!!!) reminder to self that this is based on a comic book, you really can't stop thinking how bad it is. Shallow, lame, cheesy - that's all you can think about. Even the 1984 setting was a miss as aside from a few simple gimmicks (hairdos, old TV's, soviet union, a few puns here and there) it didn't really work. Effects were terrible too, especially the WW flying like a superman. Man, what a mess, must be in my top3 of the worst superhero movies of all times, right there with the Batman and Penguin from the 1980's..."
318," I want my time back
",Very disappointed long boring missing something the 2017 had. What a waste of talent :(
319," OMG this was the worst superhero movie ever
","The script was the most unbelievable and ridiculous ""genie in the bottle"" story i've eve heard. it was confusing, it made no sense, it was not even entertaining at all, there was no real villain, and no development of her back story either.Wonderwoman somehow acquires multiple new powers (invisibility, flying) to increase her already insane arsenal?A god-like artifact gets robbed from a strip-mall jewelery story, and some failed oil-magnate has been researching said artifact his whole life?"
320," DC Comics Failed Again
","I am no longer surprise that DC Comics would/could make movies that bad. Lazy writing/Script, poor acting except for Pedro Pascal and if it wasn't for him the movie would be a complete failure. Weak action/fight scenes. Borrowed soundtrack from Sunshine & BvS Dawn Of Justice which shows how lazy they were. I liked Wonder Woman first one (2017) but this one I really hated it."
321," Really disappointing
","The first hour and 20 minutes is super slow. The CGI really looked like it was from 1984. I like kristen wiig, but she really don't fit the role she was given. The story was really badly written. Also, the move is filled with inconsistencies and stupid actions - Like a pilot deliberately flying through fireworks which explodes all around the magic military jet that magically can fly insanely much longer than it should have been able to. This might be one of the worst superhero movies i've ever watched. Not worth the money."
322," Wonder Woe
","The good thing about the original Wonder Woman movie was that, whenever we were reminded of former DC movies such as ""Green Lantern"" or ""Catwoman"", we could always say ""well, at least Wonder Woman made a great movie"".Well sadly, DC have just killed their Golden Goose. This is like Wonder Woman's version of ""Superman: The Quest for Peace"", or ""Batman and Robin"", proving that even the greatest heroes (or heroines) can still get a lousy film once in a while.I'm not sure if Patty Jenkins was feeling the pressure to produce this sequel quickly but to call it a disappointment is an understatement. With a boring storyline, low excitement and an otherwise drawn-out drama, this is truly the kind of film that has you checking your watch and secretly wishing something would happen. For me personally though, the greatest disappointment was that Wonder Woman's greatest foe Cheetah was reduced to a five minute cat fight, and was given a dull and uninteresting origin storyline.I have always been a DC fan, but looking at their track record compared to the Marvel movies, it's sad to see this happening to such well established and loved characters."
323," Very very lame
",If it wasn't for the special effects and Gal Gadot I would have given it a 3/10. The ending where everyone renounces their wishes is like a kid's movie plot. This movie is seemingly out of no where and almost has no connection with the other movies in the franchise apart from the fact that they purposely bring Steve back to life because otherwise they couldn't fit a male lead into the narrative. And again when Diana renounces her wish we can get rid of Steve again. Ah.... very very lame. Hugely disappointed.
324," I wish i can put less than 1 star
",I mean come on we are on 2020 and the technology is way advanced for the movie to be shot this way .. you can see clearly the graphics are bad .. and as a DC fan the story was not compatible at all and the movie too long .. now lost a bet with my wife as she's telling me it's like Bollywood movie graphics.. and my punishment is to watch 3 indian movies.. and in some how i do deserve this as i was telling her ww84 is good movie as i seen the first ww now I can't be more disappointed 😞

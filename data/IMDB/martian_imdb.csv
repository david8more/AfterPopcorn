0," Entertaining and slick enough to make you go with it
","I heard a lot about this film regarding its scientific validity as a piece of fiction. Perhaps as a result of this I assumed that the film would be a dry affair – an impression sort of confirmed by the longer than normal running time. As it happens, this is not the case at all because The Martian has much more in common with the entertaining blockbuster that the starry cast list and presentation suggest it will be. The story wears its science very much on its sleeve, but yet makes it accessible and fun – with the slick presentation making it so. As a result everything seems to be explained with everyday objects, and even the most complex principles are presented in simple terms (references to Iron Man for instance). As a result the film gets to have its cake and eat it – although the film is helped by the knowledge of a lot of this being possible (eg hitting a point near Pluto recently with very tight tolerances on a journey of years).The film itself doesn't really play up the drama in a heavy way, but rather does enough to invest the viewer in it without making it too much of a downer or serious. The soundtrack is hugely upbeat, the content is mostly light in tone, and the science is delivered in a very user-friendly fashion – essentially in the service of the tone and the entertainment value, nothing more than this. The starry cast add to this feeling, and use their screen presence well. Damon is consistently likable, which is just as well since he is alone in the vast majority of his scenes. The ensemble cast has a lot of depth to it, all of which are solidly watchable – Chastain, Wiig, Daniels, Eiofor, Peña, Bean, and so on. The Chinese aspects of the plot serves as another reminder that this film is a blockbuster out to make money, but it doesn't seem too out of place. Technically it looks great and it impressive how convincing the surface of Mars looks.In the end we get to the fist-pumping mission control scenes that we all knew were coming, but along the way the film is slickly packaged and entertaining as a result; even if the oft-mentioned scientific validity of it all is not something it ever seems concerned with itself."
1," pleasantly surprised
","Seeing that the movie was over 2 hrs long, and knowing that the person was going to be stuck on the planet by their self for the majority, I didn't have high hopes for it. Usually these types of movies are boring. Not a lot of writers can pull this off. This movie was really good tho. A group of us watched it and really enjoyed. There were some things they failed to explain, that we collectively came up with our own answer for. Other than that, it was great. I never felt bored or left waiting for more. Overall, I feel it was very well written, produced and acted. Well worth the watching. Some people on here have griped that it was 'predictable', but then, most movies are. Who ever watched Star Wars with the thought that Vader would ultimately win??? Who ever watched Star Trek thinking that Kirk wouldn't find a way to save the day? And frankly, who grew up watching Scooby Doo thinking that someone would actually kill Scooby, Shaggy, Fred, Daphne or Velma???"
2," If you don't care about sounds in space, then you might really enjoy this.
","My title sounds sarcastic, but I really mean it. If it doesn't bother you when films depict bangs, crashes, rumbles, booms, and pew-pew ""laser"" beams (add Austin Powers finger quotes) in the vacuum space, then load up your popcorn and get set for a wild ride. If, on the other hand, the aforementioned cinematic gimmicks bother you, then you still might enjoy this film but just be prepared for that and more.Although The Martian gives us just an occasional low, tasteful rumble when spaceships fly by, that's the least of its scientific transgressions, and things get pretty ""Mars Attacks"" preposterous in the final 20 minutes. Normally I wouldn't even bring this up since basically EVERY space movie in the history of EVER, except for 2001: A Space Odyssey (1969), has sound effects in space. But the problem is that ""The Martian"" takes a very committed, scientific, realistic tone which sets us up for an extremely scientific, realistic story. It falls short on that mark, and rather than bore you and pretentiously inflate my own ego by pointing out every flaw, I'll let you read the other reviews, or better yet: just accept that there are scientific loopholes so big that you can drive a Quasar through it (and I'm not talking about the car made in 1967).Ok if I haven't lost you, then let's talk about the fun stuff. The special effects are FANTASTIC. Director Ridley Scott (""Alien"", ""Blade Runner"") outshines himself once again with a truly magnificent feast for the eyes, and especially if you watch it on a large UHD screen, that alone is worth the price of admission.The story itself is riveting. It's a tale of survival on a barren planet where Matt Damon fights a constant battle NOT against little green men or pew-pew ""laser"" beams but against the cold and sterile reality of space. That was my favorite part of the movie, the fact that it can carry our interest for 2 1/2 hours with the only real conflict being how to survive on a planet where nothing works.Matt Damon does an incredible job of acting, portraying a complex character who realizes he's a dead man but rises to the challenge and pits every brain cell he's got against the universe. Similar to the excellent ""Cast Away"" or even the iconic ""Papillon"", it's a story about never giving up even if it kills you, and that regardless of whether we get a happy ending or a sad one, is the takeaway of this flick.I would group this film with other modern, minimalistic sci-fi flicks that take a realistic (""boring"" to some) approach but deliver a lot of drama. Flicks like ""Moon"", ""Solaris"", or on the older shelf ""Contact"", ""2010"" and possibly even the grandfather of them all, ""2001"" (though don't get your hopes up too high as I mentioned up front) will give you a taste for what's in store if you decide to watch ""The Martian""."
3," I Am The Only One Who Was Not Disappointed
","Having read the book, and being very impressed, I was looking forward to the movie interpretation. I was not the least bit disappointed. I was hoping this movie would not be an overacted, overproduced and sappy version of the original, and I was pleasantly surprised that the story played out without the overblown extraneous embellishment that Hollywood seems to depend on so often.It was great to see how the screenplay added extra material that was not in the book, and it enhanced the story to make it even better. The characters were interpreted with full respect to the intention of the author, Andy Weir, and nothing was overdone. The pacing and editing of this movie was some of the best I've seen, in fact, some of the one-liners from the book are done so quickly it pushed the story forward relentlessly. One thing that struck me is that everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves, and I think that could be a testament to the originality and uniqueness of the book. I believe anyone who reads the book is captivated and involved with the story from beginning to end, and it's possible this comes across in all phases of the production; the acting, the sets, sound, everything. They all knew they had some great material to work with and ran with it."
4," Expected more
","I am a bit of nerd of this kind of realistic science fiction movies and therefore I had high expectations of this movie. I regret to say I was disappointed.The movie tells the story of how the main character struggles to survive on Mars and how the space agencies work to get them back. But I was missing the emotions, the human touch. The main character never displays any signs of loneliness, despair or fear. He is more like ""oh, looks like I'm stuck on Mars, let's grow potatoes"". He makes a one- off reference to his parents in an electronic communication, but nowhere in the movie is it made clear what his main drive is to want to return to Earth. It appears as nothing ties him there. Maybe the directors wanted to avoid the cliché of the eight months pregnant and terminally ill wife eagerly awaiting her husband's return from a dangerous mission, but even a cliché had been better than nothing. His character is also too flat. The only character trait that is highlighted slightly in the movie is that he may be a bit too smug about himself. Nothing else to make me identify or sympathize with him. To be honest, I couldn't have cared less if he had not survived.The Mars landscape is beautifully rendered en very credible with dust clouds and all. This is the main attraction of the movie.The main problem that there is nothing novel about this movie. There have been better movies for every aspect of the film:Human aspect/psychology of being marooned in a strange place: Cast Away did it so much better; set in space: Matt Damon's role in Interstellar was more credible than his performance here. Space action scenes: Gravity had me on the edge of my seat Ground control scenes: Apollo 13 already set the standardIn summary, the movie is a beautiful, but hollow shell."
5," More marshmallow than Martian!
","The crew of an American base on Mars are forced to make an emergency departure leaving one crew-member behind presumed dead. But he is alive! Can the stranded astronaut find a way of communicating his plight to those on Earth and survive while he awaits rescue? A fairly standard 'castaway' plot but one which offers many dramatic possibilities. Unfortunately few of these are realised in this pedestrian movie which fails to generate any significant dramatic tension. This is partly because the characterisation is thin but also because the challenges the stranded astronaut faces seem to be so easily overcome. Starvation? Grow potatoes. Punctured space-helmet? Sticky tape. Mars rover vehicle lacking power? Wire up a few solar cells. Communications equipment destroyed? Motor over to a handy Mars lander. We never sense that the 'Martian' (Matt Damon) is in a desperate, mind- and body-sapping struggle against the odds (conveniently he is a botanist).Damon effectively portrays the 'Martian' as a likable guy but the problem is how to fill the two hours of the movie that remain after he is stranded? When a character is alone and unable to communicate it needs something exceptional to keep us glued to the screen. Maybe what's going on back home will do it. Not really because the cast of characters there are verging on cardboard cut-outs. The returning crew? Likewise. And the script is written on the assumption that the audience is a little dumb, e.g. A: It will be 500 Sols (Martian days) before we can rescue him. B: But his food will run out in 300 sols. C: So he'll die before we get there. Indeed! And so may we. The movie has some good FX and the Martian landscape looks convincing. But there's nothing exceptional here to compensate for the lack of an effectively told story.In essence this is an American feel-good fantasy film, celebrating ideals of technical omnipotence, racial harmony, gender equality and international collaboration (with those cool Chinese guys and gals). If only it were so. No wonder the credits rolled to the tune of The O' Jays singing 'Love Train'. School-kids will probably join in! But, to quote Sam Goldwyn, 'Include me out!'(Viewed at the Odeon, Warrington, 06 October 2015)"
6," The best of 2015...
","The film is the finest examples of science fiction and science fiction embodies everything required. Matt Damon has given the right role until the end of the case. Besides the fact that one does not really need. All movies have moved on their own. We have seen examples of this, such as the Buried and 127 Hours of very good quality movies. The master Ridley Scott's science fiction after a long separation has made a great comeback with this film case. After this film, Ridley Scott disappointing those who say the sound was cut. Thank you for this wonderful film Ridley masters. Maybe the best in 2015, as I mentioned in the title."
7," My favourite movie of the last decade
","I am genuinely amazed at the number of bad reviews there are on here for The Martian. Now I never read the book, but I absolutely LOVED the film. So much so, I watched it twice within a week. It has been such a long time since I have been left with that wonderful sense of satisfaction after investing two hours in a really good movie, and this did it 100%I am usually left highly disappointed after watching this genre of film, so I wasn't expecting much. Something like Gravity I thought, great special affects, dramatic scenes, and an average storyline, but The Martian was a whole different calibre of film and was perfectly constructed from start to finish. I was instantly thrown in to a scene where astronaut Mark Watney and his crew are setting about their mission on Mars. But the sh*t hits the fan about ten minutes in where a storm causes Watney to be thrown from the crew and left for dead. There was no long lingering introduction to the film and its characters, just instant drama and character development. This forcibly got me caring for the entire crew, and got me emotionally invested until the end.Matt Damon has always been good at what he does, but I felt he hadn't really shown off his true raw talent since Good Will Hunting back in 1997. Well he did in this. He was captivating in every single scene, and managed to do what Tom Hanks achieved in Cast Away and single handedly gripped the viewers' attention completely (with the help of a beautifully crafted script). Another reviewer got it bang on when they described it as Apollo 13 meets Castaway. The exact comparison I too had made and a combination, which works superbly. The makers of this film put so much effort in to making it scientifically accurate which made it all the more pleasurable to watch. There was nothing far-fetched or stupid like in a lot of films of the same genre, and the combination of this, with a solid plot made for a truly interesting, exciting and enjoyable film.There was drama, great effects, humour, heartwarming moments, a great soundtrack and a flawless screenplay. If you only see one movie this year, make it this one. An absolute must see."
8," The Martian: A Classic by all means.
","I read some of the reviews and decided to review this title myself. That's because I'd like you not to miss this lovely movie.It got some very bad criticism (Reviews&Ratings first page hosts at least 4 reviewers rating this title '1', lowest possible value on IMDb), most of which deals with Physics laws bended to screenwriter's desire. Well I just want to reassure you that even though I am among the nerdiest guys on the Internet, I didn't get annoyed from what I saw. Not once. And if you weren't annoyed by Tom Hanks and his boys killing almost an entire German Division before giving up in 'Save Private Ryan' you won't be annoyed too.It's a movie, not a documentary. And it's a great movie, a classic by all means."
9," Not a Ridley Scott Classic
","I can't really believe that I just finished watching a Ridley Scott science fiction movie and feeling this low, this one never felt like anywhere close to any of his classics. This is just nothing but a typical Hollywood s***. Matt did a poor performance as a character who is caught in a life and death situation. He is not scared or emotional but instead he keeps throwing Hollywood typical punch dialogues on your face like an Avenger hero when you are expecting Science. A make-up artist or a sound engineer from the set of ""Big bang theory"" would have written better science script and dialogues. For me there are plenty of ""WTF"" or ""Seriously?"" moments in this movie and I wonder what happened to one of the favorite directors of all time. Also repetitive high five/triumph scenes where we don't feel anything. To brief: Drag, bad drama, insensitive emotional scenes, poor acting, very less science, predictable and not at all funny punch dialogues! Just YIFY it, don't buy!"
10," Were my expectations too high?
","I wish I liked this movie more like a lot of moviegoers who are giving it good to even great reviews, but I left the theater with a bitter taste in my mouth I had to write this review to reconcile my feelings.Imagine a movie that takes from the glory of Gravity, Cast Away and Apollo 13 which also tries to be as hilarious and groovy as Guardians of The Galaxy at times but fails? You've got The Martian. The first 1/3 of the movie was quite engaging: An astronaut on Mars expedition team gets left behind after a huge storm because he was assumed dead. But he was alive and we watch him try and utilize every cell of his brains and science savvy to survive until help comes. But once he gets out of initial danger things get all too predictable and over-wrought. Couple of annoyances: 141 mins. About 30 mins too long for the storyline. There were too many mentions of Disco music the commander of the mission left behind to ill effect, unconvincing supporting characters on the Earth who seem to be just reciting a script, and some characters the movie shouldn't have had whatsoever (such as Kristen Wiig). Did Matt Damon do a good job ? I thought so until they showed a body double that didn't even resemble him and from there nothing he did was believable unfortunately. Had Damon actually lost weight without using a body double, I might have gotten more into the movie. But then again, he is no Christian Bale. So I wasn't expecting it but a little weight loss would have made him more convincing. A few good acting jobs came from Michael Pena and Benedict Wong whose characters added to the storytelling instead of subtracting it in the midst of too many unnecessary characters reciting an already weak script."
11," A welcome return to form for Ridley Scott.
","The Martian is a science fiction film starring Matt Damon and directed by Ridley Scott. I'm a big fan of Ridley Scott's work as a director, but I feel that most of his recent films have been very hit and miss. However, The Martian serves as a firm reminder as to why I am a fan of him in the first place. Not since Interstellar have I seen a sci-fi movie this thought-provoking or cleverly written.After an intense sandstorm devastates a manned mission to Mars, the crew are forced to abandon the desolate planet and astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is presumed dead and left stranded. Unbeknownst to the crew, Watney survived, albeit injured from the storm, and tries to find ways to survive the inhospitable climate of the red planet. Being a botanist, Watney figures out how to grow food for himself out of the crew's leftover vegetable supplies and uses his scientific knowledge to create water using hydrogen crystals and oxygen from the crew's base camp. However, these supplies can only sustain him for a matter of months as a rescue mission from Earth will take 4 years to reach him. Watney must find a way to signal back to Earth that he is alive and is in urgent need of rescuing before he runs out of food and water.Despite its somewhat bleak tone of survival in a hostile terrain, the film still manages to have its fair share of funny and heartwarming moments, which are seamlessly intertwined into the film's more dramatic scenes. Matt Damon is perfectly cast as the wisecracking, yet intelligent astronaut Mark Watney and his positive attitude toward his survival is what keeps us invested in the story. The rest of the cast are great too, which includes Jeff Daniels, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Kate Mara, Jessica Chastain, and even Donald Glover from Community. I was also particularly pleased with the film's pacing, there was never a moment that felt rushed or slow and boring. This is a welcome return to form for the legendary director Ridley Scott.I rate it a solid 9/10."
12," Thrilling Sci-Fi Survival Adaptation
","In an era where science-fiction survival tales are becoming a popular occurrence - with 'Interstellar' last year, and 'Gravity' the year before - writer Andy Weir and sci-fi connoisseur Ridley Scott team up to craft a complex tale that is carried by a single character, that character being Mark Watney, played fantastically by Matt Damon (Hollywood's biggest calamity, who requires being rescued... again).As the film tees off, we are instantly given a first-person view of the dangers of Mars and the fight for survival each astronaut is living out each day on the planet's surface, that is until their emergency evacuation - but nope, even Damon couldn't do that right. Abandoned upon the desolate surface of Mars after being presumed dead by his crew, Damon must do all he can to endure the martian environment. One huge thing I admire about this film's plot, is that it doesn't care about the intellectual level of its audience, as the quote above states so well: it'll science the s**t out of them. It's such a complex and well-executed premise that on paper seems nothing more than a impossible feat to pull off.Technically this film is stunning, the cinematography, the CGI, the production design, all utterly gorgeous, and according to the Golden Globes, it's one of the best comedies of recent years too... yeah, sure. Admittedly the tongue-in-cheek humour does add a more fresh appeal to the film, making it a little more unique than previous sci-fi adventures, it piles on layers of thrills, emotional value and complex character development to create one of the finest science fiction films of recent years."
13," Roasted, Mashed, Boiled, Sauteed? How'd you do your Potatoes?
","If you've ever wondered if Tom Hanks went even further adrift in Castaway then this could be the answer you're looking for.An Earth team are on Mars carrying out tests on the surface of The Red Planet, a message comes through from Earth warning of a huge and fast approaching storm. The team quickly assemble and flee, unfortunately Mark Watney is caught in the storm, loses his communication device and presumed dead. Watney has survived and has a harsh realism that he's abandoned on Mars with precious little supplies, no company and little chance of survival. Being 50 million miles away and 4 years away in terms of rescue life seems bleak. Watney has to defy the odds in order to survive.Ridley Scott is responsible for so many wonderful films, and for many The Martian will sit among them.This is a beautifully made film, it looks incredible, I love the realisation of Mars's surface, truly brilliant, wasn't going to be otherwise with the budget they had. The music is interesting, the score itself is quite subtle, but the tunes from Abba, Gloria Estefan etc are so random.The pacing of the film is very cleverly done, never does it feel rushed, and on very few occasions does it feel slow or padded. If i'm honest at twenty minutes I was questioning how the film was possibly going to last over two hours.Matt Damon shows his class, he carries the film on his shoulders, he gives a stellar performance as Mark, cannot be faulted. Some of the others in the film were a little hit and miss, I enjoyed Chiwetel Ejiofor very much. Jeff Daniels was fairly good. Kristen Wiig seemed an odd choice, but she was good too.It was better then I expected, I enjoyed it a lot 8/10"
14," The Martian: ""Cast Away"" Meets ""Apollo 13""
","The Martian is a new Ridley Scott classic, featuring his best work in years, the best performance I've ever seen from Matt Damon, an outstanding supporting cast, a surprisingly funny screenplay from Daredevil creator Drew Goddard, and a great narrative that ties the film together beautifully. As expected with Ridley Scott films, the film itself is visually stunning. The landscape of Mars looks absolutely breathtaking, and the scenes aboard the Hermes and back on Earth are just as sharp in detail and scope. The way he chose to make this film made it almost seem like an exceptionally made biopic. Many times during this film, I legitimately believed that Mark Watney was a real, living person that was actually stranded on Mars for many months alone. It's Cast Away meets Apollo 13, and this marriage is crafted beautifully. Matt Damon is absolutely brilliant in this film. He plays Watney with so much optimism that it actually makes the depressing aspect of the film not as depressing for me. However, when he has to put on his dramatic chops in certain scenes, he truly commits to the drama of the situation, and that right there is true Ridley Scott suspense for you. The supporting cast, everyone involved, all do great work as well. Jeff Daniels, Jessica Chastain, particularly Chiwetel Ejiofor. He is one of the best actors working today, and this movie and 12 Years a Slave shows how far he's come. The most surprisingly element about this movie though was the screenplay. The film is hilarious in some parts, in fact I'd argue that it's funnier than most comedies that have come out this year. What makes to movie unique to me was Watney's optimistic point of view. He believes that he isn't going to die on Mars, and this transforms this rather depressing situation into something comical instead. But when you really think about it, this is a very personal film about some people coming together to save somebody. That's it. And in today's world, it's nice to hear an story about people coming together to save one of their own. I have nothing bad to say about The Martian. It's the best film I've seen all year."
15," Ridley proving himself once again
","Strong, well-executed, moving. Classic Scott-style directing, with its fast pace, yet never leaving emotion behind, keeping you glued to the screen throughout the runtime. Reminiscent of the original Alien, yet clearly proving the director's overall increased maturity and experience. My thoughts on the cinematography are mixed, from the one hand side the movie features a particularly bland color palette, most sequences however are nice, vivid and well-balanced. What strikes me the most is the fact that they didn't account for the reduced gravity on Mars, however not only is the price cut behind this clear, but also you forget it surprisingly easily in the first 10 minutes or so, since everything else is so gripping. The visual effects are simply flawless, realistic to the maximum and beautiful at the same time. The story itself and the characters are simply masterful, not at all out-of-this-world, or should i say the way facts are presented combined with the pacing makes you believe it's all happening at the time you're watching the movie. Though i am probably not meant to make this comparison, it leaves (in my humble opinion) Nolan's ""Interstellar"", a great movie on its own, completely in the dust, simply proving the effect Scott's experience has had on his work. A must-watch."
16," Smart, exciting crowd-pleaser
","Exceptional sci-fi drama from Ridley Scott about an astronaut (Matt Damon) stranded on Mars and the efforts made to rescue him. As others have pointed out, there's more than a little bit here that reminds you of movies like Apollo 13 and Cast Away (particularly the former). I fail to see how that's a knock on it but it's being presented as such by some. We all come to movies with our own expectations and baggage. I'm not a Scott fanboy expecting him to wow me (his last two films were not great). I just wanted to be entertained and this did the trick. It's a movie aimed at the masses that is smarter than your average movie aimed at the masses. Maybe it's not for all nerds (a quick glance at some of the reviews shows a lot of inane nit-picking from people who seem to have no concept of dramatic license), but I didn't find the movie dumbed-down at all. I also want to say how much I appreciated that this managed to stay remarkably light and positive while still maintaining the tension, proving once again that you don't have to be depressing to be good drama. If you haven't seen The Martian yet, you should. It's a great film with a first-rate cast, good direction, and stellar effects. If you're just looking for a quality movie to entertain you for a while, this should be something you'll enjoy."
17," This movie is really NOT good! Here's why.
","It's so frustrating when so many people like and praise a movie that really doesn't deserve it. The Martian is such a movie. I had such high hopes for it after all the hype, and after reading reviews by smart critics I usually agree with, but it was such a disappointment. Here's why: Plausibility. Just like Gravity, there are so many non-sensical depictions of the physics of space travel, it makes my head hurt, and I'm not even a physicist. The characters and their actions are pretty implausible too, starting with Damon's chipper attitude about being left alone on a planet 100 million miles from Earth, but certainly not ending there. After realizing he is alone and will be for so long that he will run out of food, he gets the brilliant idea to try to grow his own, which we are supposed to take as a mark of his plucky brilliance. But he's a botanist! What would a botanist be doing on a space mission *except* studying how things grow? And then when an accident causes all his potato plants to die, the brains at NASA (who can't believe he figured a way to grow potatoes in the first place) instantly conclude (and tell us) that since the accident froze all the bacteria in the soil, he won't be able to grow any more. Why not? He still has potatoes to eat, and he still, presumably, shits occasionally, so he has all the ingredients he used the first time. Ugh! My brain hurts! Writing. The script seems written more by market researchers than a screenwriter. Corny little one-liners (""My balls are frozen!"") appeal to the lowest common denominator in the audience, and the relentlessly happy tone makes being stranded on Mars seem like a big party, complete with disco music (literally). And the dialog!! There's a moment when Jeff Daniels, the head of NASA (whom it is hard to imagine has ever ever taken a science class or piloted anything) talks to the heads of the Chinese Space agency who offer (presumedly--we only hear his end of the conversation) to lend one of their ships to the rescue effort. He says, ""Mmm Hmm. Okay. I see. Thank you."" (That's what a discussion about loaning spacecraft between two space agencies sounds like.) Then he hangs up the phone, clenches his fists, and says, ""Yes!"" It's like Homer Simpson finding out there is still one donut left. That someone wrote that line is astounding. That the director and actor saw fit to actually shoot it is bewildering. That it survived the editing process and made it into the final cut--well, there should be an investigation. Pacing. It's a movie about being stranded on Mars for months and months. Why does it feel like a comedy by Woody Allen or Edgar Wright? There is never a pause, never a prolonged quiet moment that might begin to capture something of the unbelievable space and loneliness this movie is supposed to be about. Instead, it is a constant rapid fire of dialog and action. Even the scenes where he is communicating with Earth via text happens faster than I usually get with my iPhone and 4G. (NASA technicians mention, at one point, that there is a 25 minute delay between all communications, but the filmmakers hope we forget this two minutes later when all the subsequent conversations happen instantly). Then there is the rest of the crew and their additional unplanned two years of extra time stuck in the spaceship, going all the way BACK to Mars to pick up what they left there. If I have to run back home to get something I forgot, the trip always seems infuriatingly long. But not these cheery space travelers! Another two years in space! No problem! And it takes only two minutes of screen time. Piece of cake! AGH! What a frustrating experience. If you want a sugar-coated popcorn movie that will make you think that if being on stranded on Mars isn't really so bad, why complain about our petty little problems here on Earth? then this movie might be for you. It does for being stranded in space what The Shawshank Redemption does for being in prison. It tries to tell us that it's really not THAT bad after all. It's such a lie, and such a disappointment, all the more so because there are so many serious issues and exciting psychological and scientific aspects about space that could have been explored here."
18," Balancing out good reviews
","Starts ok. Gets weaker and weaker.1. Every problem or life threatening situation is solved immediately so it never feels this guy is in peril.2. Ridiculous nonsensical physics throughout.3. Main character is a botanist and yet everyone is bewildered he can grow crops. Isn't that what he was presumably up there for?4. All supporting characters are generic and bland.5. The original crew decide within 30 seconds to turn around and go back to Mars. Good Lord. They basically act like spending another 2 years in space and risking their lives on a statistically improbable mission is a no brainer. This would be a ridiculously hard decision that would involve an intense debate.6. The Chinese officially offering their assistance took place over one silly phone call.7. Matt Damon flying through space via a hole in his suit.8. Matt Damon seems nearly completely unphased that he has been left stranded and unlike in Castaway, there is no suggestion that his mental health is in any way affected by such a difficult situation.On and on I could go."
19," The worst thing about this movie
","Spoilers below. The worst thing about about this movie was that everything is so hard to believe because it's such nonsense. It doesn't follow basic physic laws. It doesn't take much to get me invested in a movie as a viewer, but this just goes too far. The absolute worst flaw is not even all the fake science, nor I'd it the overuse of disco music or the fact that the astronaut doesn't really get desperate and only makes cheesy jokes... No, it's the fact that China's space program has some secret spaceship which they want to reveal and give up for the eyes of the world to save one unknown American dude. That just doesn't make any sense. First of all, China could care less, also, why give up a rocket on which you've been apparently working in secret, just to send food up to space? And if all this would happen for some strange reason... America responds with 'ok. I see. Thank you'. Hangs up and goes ' yessssssss.' Idiotic."
20," Shallow, empty
","I was waiting for this movie for a few weeks and was greatly disappointed when I finally watched it.It doesn't matter if the number of potatoes to survive is accurate, if you are using toxic rocket fuel to make water, you do not feel lonely and isolated, and you are not worried about oxygen - you are just having fun - isolated for 300-500 days without anyone or anything else around - the guy seems pretty comfortable and not worried.Impossible to connect with characters. Too many stereotypes. Blatant sales and marketing, actor and story picks for the sake of selling more tickets.I hope I will save my money and time, next movie like this comes out."
21," Matt, you're not making this easy
","This tedious family adventure film is the latest contribution to the popular and well established 'Where Are We Rescuing Matt H. Damon From This Week?' genre.I like Matt H. Damon, I really do. But he's been making it very difficult recently, and this 2+ hour marathon just doesn't help.Damon plays an astronaut accidentally marooned on Mars by a storm that literally could not happen because Mars lacks the necessary atmospheric conditions, where he must somehow survive with nothing but an unlimited supply of electricity, an unlimited supply of water, an entirely self- sufficient artificial habitat, half a dozen spare space suits, multiple land vehicles and probes (all in perfect working order), food supplies intended for half a dozen people, and a large quantity of magical potato seedlings that grow to maturity in just a few days despite a complete absence of soil nutrients.Since the first act establishes that Damon is so well set up he doesn't actually need rescuing, Ridley Scott fabricates a second act 'emergency' in a vain attempt to raise tension (it doesn't).Damon keeps in contact with Earth via a magical transmission technology that provides full HD streaming with no latency whatsoever, allowing him to have real time conversations with NASA headquarters, where everyone does and says whatever they want because there is no chain of command even though it's ostensibly run by Jeff Daniels (played by Jeff Daniels).His fellow astronauts remain hovering above Mars, beaming their own HD stream to NASA by the use of a magical camera that automatically homes in on Damon regardless of where he is on the planet.NASA builds a brand new rocket from scratch in less than 14 days so they can send Damon a fresh load of unlimited supplies. It explodes immediately after takeoff because Ridley Scott still has another hour to fill. Meanwhile Damon accidentally blows up his potatoes.NASA's lone Chinese employee suddenly remembers that his uncle has a private rocket he's never got around to using, so they phone China and ask if NASA can borrow it. The uncle agrees so the Chinese government sends it into space immediately, where it is instead caught by Damon's astronaut colleagues, who nick all the supplies.Meanwhile Damon is travelling to the other side of the planet, where he intends to escape using a previously unsuspected bonus rocket that just happens to be lying around the place in perfect working order. Damon can't carry his unlimited supply of water and only has enough room in his vehicle for a few sandwiches, but by a remarkable stroke of luck it turns out that his body is capable of indefinite peak physical performance despite minimal hydration and a complete lack of nutrition, so that's OK. Also it turns out that the gravity on Mars is exactly the same as Earth's, so he hasn't lost any muscle tone.Damon arrives at the bonus rocket and is told by NASA that it's actually too heavy to lift off the planet despite being designed for that exact purpose (???) The only solution is to remove the nose of the rocket, which is actually easier than it sounds because the entire spacecraft is made of Lego and can be easily disassembled by a single undernourished man with no tools.With the nose of the rocket removed, Damon risks being killed by the extreme physical pressure generated by takeoff. NASA points out that a simple tarpaulin is strong enough to protect him, so he finds a spare one from... somewhere... and straps it on.Damon's fellow astronauts pair their ship with his rocket using Bluetooth, and take over the controls. Damon is almost crushed to a pulp as the rocket leaves Mars, because it turns out that tarpaulin isn't as strong as industrial steel after all.Somebody on the astronauts' ship blows something up because of reasons, and this somehow makes it easier for one of them to rescue Damon, who has jumped out of his rocket and is now flying towards their ship with the aid of a hole in the finger of his space suit and an unlimited supply of pressurised oxygen.NASA is helpfully streaming this heroic rescue to the entire planet using their magical realtime HD stream, because of course they are.Damon and his fellow astronauts arrive home safely just a few hours later, and Damon is rewarded with a free pair of glasses. Henceforth, everyone must call him 'Doctor.' Because doctors have glasses.I rate The Martian at 13.32 on the Haglee Scale, which works out as a mediocre 4/10 on IMDb."
22," Utter piece of trash
","Boy, I haven't hated a movie this much in a long time. I actually just joined IMDb (I have been a long term viewer) in order to vent this out of my system, and to express my amazement that this terrible, vapid, cliché movie won a Golden Globe and is nominated for the Oscar best movie of the year. What the heck is going on? Are Aliens sucking the brain matter out of us little by little so that we actually think this tripe is not only good, but great? A script a high schooler could have written, bad acting, terrible dialogue, one dimensional characters you don't care about, bad disco music, overly politically correct casting, mistakes in basic ""science"", stupid hap-hap-happy ending where everyone in the world (literally) is jumping, smiling and hugging each other, I could go on and on. This movie was so bad we actually kept watching it, like the morbid curiosity of looking at an auto accident. My favorite line of the movie was when Jeff Daniels said that the Matt Damon character would be fine with his supplies ""as long as nothing goes wrong"". I looked at my husband and said sarcastically ""Gee, I wonder if something is going to go wrong"", and wouldn't you know it, in the very next scene it does. We have sworn off any future Ridley Scott movies, for good. He is obviously in cahoots with the Aliens sucking out all our brain matter."
23," Were all the scientists on a day off when this script was written?
","Wow this was a bad one, I thought Interstellar was painful but this was even worse (I know hard to believe!) My favourite part in the whole movie was when Matt points out that an explosion which occurred in a particular room during an experiment he was conducting was due to (you'll love this!) him exhaling too much oxygen into the room! Correct me if I'm wrong but I'm pretty sure we exhale CO2 and inhale O2. I think even a fifth grader would be able to tell me that. I nearly cried with laughter when I heard him say that line and how he kept a straight face is beyond me, unless he thinks its true of course.This was just the beginning of the lack of believable science in this movie and it was so painful to watch after more and more random unbelievable events started popping up. His one line killed the movie for me, from that point on I was looking for more ""errors"" and they just kept on coming.Anyway to cover the opening sequence with how poor Matt ends up left on Mars to die, well there's a big storm that no one seems coming, they all rush to their landing vehicle to hot tail it back up to their orbiting mothership. Matt gets a whack in the gut with something (which we later find out pierced his suit completely but yet somehow the suit manages to stay pressurised with a hole in it) and decides to pass out. The rest of the crew fly back up to the mothership and, get this, immediately set course for home! They don't stay in orbit for say another 24 hours and recover Matt's body they just leg it back home asap. Odd I thought for a NASA mission to just abandon him and not say bring the body back for his family to bury.When poor Matt wakes up he finds all the communications are down and all his friends gone. And by communications I mean the one satellite dish that was stuck to the habitat roof has blown down in the storm and been completely demolished, but not one of the solar panels outside is damaged, just a bit sandy. Seeing how comms back to Earth would be one of the critical systems would there not be 3 or 4 other methods of calling home, redundancies in case of a disaster? NASA didn't see the point in having any of those backups on this mission to Mars, what could possibly go wrong? Another good one is when he is told to drill and cut a whole in the roof of a perfectly airtight rover and sticky tape a big plastic balloon to the top of it. No reason is given for this yet it happens, I think it's so he can take some more plastic painting sheets with him but I cant be certain. Also wouldn't this drilling and cutting a big hole compromise the pressurisation integrity rendering the vehicle unsafe to drive around in without a space suite on, oh but not for Matt, he happily drives around Mars with no suit on at all with his new plastic sticky taped sunroof fitted trying to work out how far he can get on his batteries while whinging about how he'll never make it to the RV due to lack of power all the while singing along to the stereo with more flood lights turned on than at a football stadium. Um turn some crap off Matt that'll save you some juice.Again another scene in the movie, an airlock somehow gets blown to bits and a big gaping whole is left in the side of the habitat Matt lives in. The solution, a big piece of plastic sheet and more sticky tape, he then repressurises the habitat and somehow his sticky taped plastic painting sheet is able to hold up fine, outside there are wild storms going on (which are visible through a few of the more believable looking pressurised windows) raging away and not one single piece of debris punches through his plastic painting drop sheet or does any damage to his rover or solar panels.The mission to get him home is to send back the craft which ran away and left him in the beginning. NASA didn't tell the crew of the ship for months that he was still alive as they didn't want to hurt their feelings! So the plan to get him back is drive the mothership all the way back to Earth, do some gravity sling shot thing around Earth (sounds like Apollo 13?) rendezvous with a supplies pod (food and movies onboard probably) and fly all the way back to Mars and pick him up as he fires himself into space from a lander (after stripping out all the gear inside, removing the roof and covering it with another plastic painting sheet held on with sticky tape to save weight) already there for the next disastrous mission to Mars NASA has already cooked up.For me this movie just went too far, way beyond what any normal person with a even a tiny grasp of science can cope with. I cannot believe Ridley, NASA and JPL were happy to have their names mentioned let alone their relevant ground breaking departments portrayed with such a lack of any real science.I know it's a SciFi movie but you have to get the basics right and have some kind of explanation for the viewer to be able to buy into the ludicrous things which take place in the movie. Otherwise it just becomes a complete bore to watch and the viewer spends their time looking for more flaws.My opinion, save yourself the money, stay home, get a pizza in & watch Blade Runner on BluRay again :-)"
24," Smart, funny, eventful, and well performed
","The Martian, based on the novel of the same name written by author Andy Weir, is an eventful movie that serves both as an epic sci-fi adventure, but also provides viewers with some smart laughs. Those are who not that interested in sci-fi will probably end up liking the movie, because it is not unrealistic. Acting wise, Matt Damon puts in an excellent performance as the lead, and supporting actors such as Jessica Chastain, also put in solid performances. Probably one of the best aspects of the film, is that the mood of the movie is quite optimistic, considering that the situation of being stuck on mars, is quite a scary one, that requires a lot of panic. In Conclusion, The martian is a fun, smart movie, that is likely to be enjoyed by most audiences who watch it."
25," Insulting
","Do not trust any review above 2 stars. I think such users are payed reviewers.I went to watch this ""movie"" not expecting much, but what i get was a total frustration. I'd like to get a refund for the ticked i payed because i felt cheated. The movie is insulting to human intelligence. Totally pointless, superficial and from a scientific point of view, is an insult to every scientist. In addition i hope the NASA will call the production to a courtyard for how they have been represented in the movie. Acting is quite often terrible too, no psychological immersion, all is a joke and with a little montage everything become possible... this movie is a waste of money and time, i want my money back!!!Do not waste money and time over this one!THE SPOILER PART REAT AT YOUR OWN DISCRECTION: Think about : 1- growing potato over a soil not tested fertilized with astronauts ""poo""... what about bacteria ? What about soil minerals and PH ? ... why he had potatoes in a martian station? (that's a joke)2- why there is no scientific team studying and calculating ? Just a bunch of guys wandering around saying ""yes"" to the big boss or the minor actor acting like the ""genius"" ?? 3- No information control at the NASA center??? Are you kidding me ??? An astronauts left alone over mars, does a real-time chatting with a ""guy"" (not even a psychologist) and such conversations are real-time public shared !!!! ARE YOU F*****G KIDDIN ME????? 4- sorry i forgot to mention that in such movie radiation are totally ignored, as you will never see the reflecting visor down even in ""free space"" while glancing at sunThere are tons of those nonsenses in the movie... i just have time to write down 4, but all the movie is 2 hours of such nonsenses.TO CONCLUDE: this ""movie"" is an insult to the viewer, who liked it does ignore even the basic concepts of science, a terrible superficial plot. This ""movie"" is a scam, a fraud to steal our money. I've been cheated, listen to me and don't be fooled keep you time and money for something better."
26," I'm giving up on Ridley Scott!
","Man, I was so disappointed by this movie! Did I have too high expectations? I don't think so. If you have a bunch of actually Hollywood-A-class actors and a director who made ""Blade Runner"" and ""Alien"", you are officially allowed to have expectations! But they all failed terribly in my opinion. I could rant about the bad jokes, the awful soundtrack and the cheesy 3D-renderings - why didn't they manage one single time to make these things, the ship, the rover, actually look big? It all looked like toys! Awful! But my biggest complaint is the terrible storytelling! The movie had zero suspense from beginning to end. It was always, hey we have a problem, let's have a cool dialog/monologue, and then, hey, we'll solve the problem within the next minute - no problem at all! Hey, I got no milk in the fridge, OK I'll get some from the supermarket... That level of depth. I didn't feel for one single minute with the main character and I couldn't have cared less, when he had died in the end. There was at some points emotional music and we all were told, that this and that is dangerous and what not. But I couldn't feel it at all. Just for comparison: ""Gravity"" had me on the edge of the seat and ""Interstellar"" had me hold my breath. Not to mention ""Moon"", ""Blade Runner"" and ""Odyssee"". Wasn't there a time, when Ridley Scott made actually great movies? Do yourself a favor and spend the money on something else. This movie isn't worth it."
27," another pathetic movie of Ridiculous Scott
","because I care about the future, I looked forward to this movie. But while i watched it, it was a struggle to make it to the end. I'm very disappointed. Easily i blame the director, but there is a bigger production team who failed. They created a film of shallow, lame, cliché stereotypes with bad developed characters.It's all about the hero. It's not about ""Matt Damon in his best role"". When he's suppose to be funny, it's the worst. Jessica Chastain was brilliant in Interstellar, so now she lights up another successful chapter of imaginary human spaceflight ? Sorry, I much more think of a massive loss of image.If you wish to make future NASA look smart, cute and sexy, do not pick Jeff Daniels as it's director ! Every time 'Teddy' shows up, I expected Jim Carrey dancing to the disco sound. It wasn't even funny once to blame Lewis for her taste of music, and it wasn't funny to blame her again and again. Please, Mister Scott, if you grab one more time into the box of stereotypes and transform actors like Sean Bean, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Jeff Daniels Matt Damon, Jessica Chastain and Michael Peña into fools: retire ! Thank you.P. S. Hold on, you didn't fail on Mackenzie Davis, she made NASA look cute."
28," More Hollywood Garbage
","I stopped watching after Matt Damon said, ""In the face of overwhelming odds, I'm left with only one option: I'm gonna have to science the $hit out of this."" I wouldn't be surprised if NASA scientists and the ghost of Carl Sagan weren't collectively cringing after hearing this horrible drivel. Do they think this is clever writing, or are they just too lazy to write something good? Why don't they just have the actors say, ""Yada yada yada, rocket propulsion, blah blah blah, Mars, something, something, science...""I've said it before: I think Hollywood should just give up all pretense and film one of their over-paid, self-important ""actors"" to sit on a toilet for 2 hours. It couldn't be any worse than this movie or most of the other garbage they keep churning out in order to separate us peasants from our hard-earned money."
29," Sir Ridley! More gravitas than Gravity! More stellar than Interstellar!
","After sleeping through Gravity and laughing through Interstellar, (a fine unintentional comedy if ever there was one), it's good to see a contemporary Sci-fi tell the story well - and do the science right.I am not a big Matt Damon fan, mainly because of his loudmouthed lefty nonsense and his limited acting range, but he was very good in this. The support cast were also excellent, especially the always compelling black guy who I can't spell the name of and Harry Dunne.There was some unfortunate pandering by Sir Ridley to the PC brigade, which the film could have done without. The Gen-Y unhygienic (accurate), disorganised, (accurate), disrespectful (accurate), black guy, who also happened to be an astrodynamics genius rocket scientist, (inaccurate), was a poor casting choice. Also to suggest the Chinese would give a fat rat's crack about an American astronaut....at the expense of their state rocket-technology secrets....is laughably far-fetched. Probably more far fetched than flying into space in a roofless/windowless capsule.But putting the film's failings aside, at least Ridley told a good story, laced it with plenty of well-explained science, spliced it with genuine humour and soaked it in amazing vistas of the Martian landscape. Plus he showed that if you put a woman in charge of a dangerous mission, she will ultimately fail. This degree of honesty is refreshing, in an age where every second antagonist is a flimsy female (beating up men ten times her size), or a female weapons expert/assassin/whatever.Show em as they are, Ridley. Well done.All in all a great film where I expected a load of boring tripe.8/10."
30," Is this a parody?
","When this movie came out I heard only good things about it. I thought this would be a rather realistic, thought-provoking and dramatic survival story that would make me emotional because it's so well done. What I got was a comedy movie with unbelievable bad dialogues like I have seen and heard them only in very low budget horror/splatter movies. I refuse to believe that grown-ups are laughing at those jokes. The portrayal of the emotions was badly done. Very, very badly. The characters lacked any personality. There was no soul, no depth, no character you could get invested. Everything was extremely shallow and forced-funny.
5 stars because of the landscape and everything else. The concept was nice and interesting. The acting was okay. The writing brought this movie down."
31," Not the film you think it is.
","The Martian (2015) directed by Ridley Scott, written by Drew Goddard, based on the novel by Andy Weir. This is not the film you think it is. To elaborate, the premise of the The Martian suggests a tale about one man's solitary struggle against seemingly insurmountable odds as he overcomes one hurdle after another while stranded on Mars. Isolated and detached from humanity in every sense of the word we would expect to see a mans emotional and intellectual battle with this overbearing desolation and the pain of never seeing his loved ones again. However, in stark contrast to this what we get is an eternally optimistic film with a persistently upbeat, wise-cracking protagonist set to a soundtrack of '70s disco music. The tone is consistently light throughout, save for a few fleeting moments such as when Matt Damon's character mentions his parents on earth or the brief moments when something doesn't quite go to plan at NASA. When they do encounter a problem it's resolved so quickly it scarcely seems to have posed any threat. The films insistence on never getting weighed down by it's subject matter unfortunately means that it fails to produce any real tension. From very early on in the film it's clear that everything will be OK by the end, one way or another this astronaut is getting home safe, that much you can be sure on. Consequently what we have then is an entertaining, easy to watch space travel story in which we watch an astronaut devise some nifty scientific devices to help him survive in his man made habitat while he waits for NASA to rescue him. There are several scenes where Damon's character actually seems to be enjoying himself. The character development is paper thin, he starts of a self assured, relatively cheerful every-man who endears himself to us almost instantly. By the end of the film he remains exactly that, his harrowing experience of surviving a harsh alien wasteland after being left for dead by his crew has failed to instill even the slightest sense of self-reflection or introspective behavior. The question then remains, does this make it a 'bad' film? My answer is no. It's just not what you'd expect from a Ridley Scott sci-fi. It's an easy going film with a likable protagonist, a healthy dose of humour with just a touch of sentimentality. I will say that I appreciated that we had both a female captain leading the space crew and not even the slightest hint of an unnecessary romantic subplot. Adjust your expectations and you'll have a good time. If, however, you were hoping for a masterpiece of suspense that brilliantly captures the terrifying dangers of space, Scott already made that film in 1979."
32," Fun but Far From Great
","This is certainly an entertaining film as a formula movie. It's fun like the earlier ""Independence Day"" film with Bill Pullman and Will Smith. We put a poor guy in an untenable situation, trapped on a planet when his colleagues are forced to take off and leave him behind. As a scientist, he does miraculous things to stay alive, including creating a greenhouse where he can grow potatoes (that just happen to be on board providing seed). That's OK. That's a plot element. He also has incredible knowledge of all the incredible stuff left behind on Mars. An amazing rover as well as a nuclear device. That's OK too because we can't have a plot without something for this guy to do. Where it falls down is in the reality of NASA (which we are told are a pack of insensitive boobs or nerds). They are going to do this and then they are going to do that. Jeff Daniels plays a stuck-in-the-mud guy who is only concerned about the politics of the job. I love Matt Damon. I've seen nearly everything he has done. He's adequate in this film but certainly not Academy Award material. He expresses almost no emotions other than a couple little under-control tantrums. What about the loneliness, the sameness of every day? Years of eating potatoes. Anyway, it is candy for those who don't want to think very much. It's very impresstive looking and the special effects are awesome. We've become a bit spoiled, I guess. Things by the formula."
33," What a ridiculous waste of time. A true insult of a viewer's intelligence.
","1st of all, the premise is all wrong, so there is no suspended disbelief effect here. Therefore, the rest of the movie becomes less than believable. BTW, I ""appreciate"" the whole re-use and abuse of the ""Aliens"" concepts and designs in the initial titles and the crew quarters appearances. Awesome. Reuse/Recycle. No new ideas there.A whole manned mission to Mars couldn't include a way to observe the Martian weather (this being possible for tens of years as we speak) and to land safely at a nice, wind-safe crater or to anchor a return vehicle securely enough? REALLY? And once a bit of a storm blew, the entire crew had to hurry back to Earth? ALL THE WAY BACK? They could not stay in the Martian orbit for a few hours even to make sure that they didn't leave anyone behind? WHAT? The orbit became dangerous too because of some storm? Am I the only one who could not believe that the hatches would seal nicely in a sand/rock/what's not storm? There was no two-way comm with any crew members? Once someone got blown away, then it was the end for him/her? Even on Earth this sounds dumb. Cool crappy, unrealistic suits! No real protection, funny boots, no visible means of backpacked life-support, lots of light blinding the users inside helmets and no light (as well as no two-way comm) for the actual work?! Then, no one could keep a communication satellite in the Martian orbit? So that no one would have to reinvent the wheel it order to communicate between the surface and the command center??? No further comments here.Kudos to the political correctness lawyers. They didn't miss one single detail. The manned mission to Mars includes the politically correct balance of males and females, they got a Mexican, a German (seriously???), and then the entire NASA's Martian program has the necessary number of very respectfully black Hindus and other African Americans. Good Job! Then there is the necessary number of Asians gets involved. And the Chinese government decides what's wrong with the whole rescue mission. Nice.Considering that neither NASA nor the Chinese can STILL fly anything worth a rat's jazz into space without the Russian-made tech, it is funny to see the whole story without any Russian involvement. Even the privately funded SpaceX program seems more effective these days than NASA! Nice political BS, holly-crap-wood.Look. I have given up expecting anything even closely serious from Hollywood. Yes, this movie is another all-time-low. Thank you for producing another piece of expensive garbage intended for people who practically kill one another on each ""black Friday"". I hope that those zombies enjoy this kind of BS. Ridley Scott, you, Sir, are a talent-less waste. Please, retire already. O&O."
34," Unintentionally funny, otherwise OMG awful!
","I watched this movie with a friend who has no technical background, and she pronounced it good. I should note that my friend is Canadian, and with the possible exception of Neil Young, Canadians are an innately polite people.Meanwhile, being American, I was laughing internally until I spotted. I also note that I knew the author of the book (when he was a kid) through a workplace and personal friendship with his father. Andy Weir is an incredibly gifted science geek, as is his dad. I therefore know that none of the gross scientific transgressions in the film can be blamed on his ignorance. Andy openly admits to willfully ignoring a few things like the thin Martian atmosphere in the interest of moving the story forward. He correctly understood the impatience of miseducated Americans with annoyances such as basic laws of physics. IOW, he took the movie money and ran, like the smart kid I know him to be. So I would say that any idiotic disregard of science on screen—the use of Visqueen and duct tape to secure a 6 foot hole vacated by (richly ironic) a blown hatch cover against a 50,000 pound pressure gradient, for example—resulted either from production or directorial indifference. The list of anti-Newtonian horrors goes on, and gets funnier, particularly when Matt Damon punctures his space glove and uses the escaping oxygen to propel himself toward his rescuer. Next, I was half expecting the crew of the rescuing spacecraft to line up, bend over, and torch off an ensemble fart to correct a course deviation.In any case, this movie was not intended to portray a real human battle against nature, as was so wonderfully chronicled in Apollo 13.Rather, The Martian was intended to make money by playing on current themes of political correctness and the warm fuzzies of international cooperation, framed by the awesomeness of space.It fails spectacularly even at this wretched goal—not at making money, you understand, but the furtherance of World Peace—placing its bets on star power, flaccid dialogue, dumbass jokes and cheap CGI effects instead of a solid script, good acting and a credible stab at realism. Jeff Daniels as the director of NASA? My God...Watch this movie only if you're looking for something to distract you from doing something more useful, such as expressing the dog's impacted anal glands.Higher emotional content can be found by chopping up an onion."
35," Predictable, immature dialogs, artificial heroism, non-innovative action.
","I believe this is one of the overrated films on IMDb. While it has a high user rating and for some reason totally mistakenly in the Top 250, user reviews are mostly bad. And they are right. This movie is boring, unrealistic and totally not entertaining. I mean, what makes a movie a good movie? We all know that a movie is not real. We still feel entertained, why? Because we can feel the main characters struggle in a difficult situation, we suffer with him, we have empathy. None of these are happening to the audience when you watch this one.It was actually the sappy behavior of the characters making you feel bored watching. I would have accepted the fact that he grew potatoes out of the feces of his buddies and they have left them there, okay why not ... he a botanist (how exciting by the way).Just a few examples: For reasons unknown, he starts taking Vicodin with his potato - I actually had to look it up what Vicodin was, and then did not understand the message of this.The captain of the ship blames himself immediately ""I left him there"" after they have received the message. Come on guys, give the character some time to emotionally apprehend the situation, before she starts blaming herself! Nobody does that immediately... not ever!Who is this stupid moron looking like a drug addict in his totally messy office, where no one should have taken seriously? A total loner-loser, who works for NASA, doesn't even know the directors name when he is in his office... and then performs an act of a 3-year- old? What is this, are you kidding me? Why should the audience take this seriously at all?Ridley Scott has totally failed to give the crew them some meaning. They could have just robots as far as I am concerned, wouldn't make this movie less worse.There is just no excitement the whole time. He was deserted. You know exactly that his own crew will go back to help him at about in the middle of the movie. You know the attempt with the first rocket will fail, because you have already understood, some heroism with the ""we won't let anybody behind""-message is actually the main story here. But you had to watch all that story of building that bogus rocket – I was bored to death! And then it explodes and fails, what a surprise!So after that, you beg for a plot where something miraculous will happen. Instead, something totally ordinary happens, again! He flies to the crew. An astronaut goes out, he flies out of his capsule. I was asking myself... this is it?For a moment I thought I was watching a Roland Emmerich, but I had sworn never to watch an Emmerich again. Ridley Scott now goes the same way. Predictable, immature dialogs, artificial heroism, non- innovative action."
36," So Science-y.
","This movie is so science-y. You will just love how much it quotes science. Like, you know, real science. And that is why I loved this movie. Science tells us that everything in it is totally possible. Anybody who doesn't like this movie must be anti-science. Because science rules. It's like Neil DeGrasse Tyson and Bill Nye had a love child. And Carl Sagan.But don't just go for all the science. The story is so unique. I know Matt Damon just famously played a brilliant NASA astronaut who got stranded on a planet in the movie Interstellar, and that Jessica Chastain was also in that one, but it is not like Interstellar at all (what was with that weird ending, anyway??). The Martian has its own unique plot centered around a team of brilliant NASA scientists in Houston trying to get their astronauts home after a difficult journey that had to be cut short, but it is not like Apollo 13. Sure, in both movies they don't have enough fuel, and there is an explosion on board, and they have to use this brilliantly hatched scheme to use gravitational pull to propel them. But get this: while Apollo 13 had its astronauts being propelled around the moon, The Martian has them going around Earth! Science says that the earth is way bigger than the moon, which makes this way cooler. Nope, not at all like the entire movie Apollo 13. Oh, and also, there is a great part at the end that made me feel just like I was watching Gravity again. You'll know the part when you see it. But really it is nothing like Gravity.It is so funny through the whole movie when Matt Damon explains everything in minute detail as it happens. Such a brilliant choice by the writer and director. Exposition like that is so scientific because he has to know all those big words in order to explain everything. I can imagine all the anti-science global warming deniers' heads exploding at these parts, but if you're anything like me, you will find yourself nodding along and thinking, ""Yep! I know what he's talking about!"" Example: that moment he had to make his own water and he said, ""Fortunately, I know the recipe. Take hydrogen. Add oxygen. Burn."" So true!Again, The Martian is a smart, complex movie. Luckily, in another brilliant choice by director Ridley Scott, title cards appear at the beginning of nearly every scene explaining where the action is taking place, and who is taking part in it. I found this extremely helpful, as it was a bit confusing when it would switch from Mars to Earth all the time. Plus, it was extremely gratifying when I would see a new character, and before I even had time to think who the heck is that, lo and behold, his or her name and title would appear to clear away all doubt.Then there's the music: So many familiar tunes!And I've been hearing a lot about perhaps the most quotable line of any movie for years—you know the line—let me just say it because it is so funny: ""I'm gonna have to science the s*** out of this."" --That is said by Matt Damon's character, Mark Watney, who is literally one of the smartest and most capable men ever. But as you can tell, he isn't all stuffy, you know? He is really funny. Can I just quote some more of his hilarious lines? I couldn't stop laughing the whole way through as he smugly said these things to the audience, I mean his camera:""Hi, I'm Mark Watney and I'm still alive... obviously.""""I don't want to come off as arrogant here, but I'm the greatest botanist on this planet.""""Mars will come to fear my botany powers.""""So yeah, I'm f***ed.""""In your face, Neil Armstrong!""""Tell Commander Lewis, disco sucks."" ""F***!""""So I blew myself up.""""Mark Watney: Space Pirate.""""I admit it's fatally dangerous, but I'd get to fly around like Iron Man.""""F*** you, Mars.""Anyway, he is hilarious as you can tell, and this movie definitely deserves all the praise it is getting for its humor alone. You will just love this.Ten/Ten ""Stars"" (Get it?)"
37," Great, realistic enough Sci-Fi movie
","This is a great sci-fi movie that's realistic enough to not be weighed down by being unrealistic or ridiculous in that way.The acting and plot are great. The story is engaging, and Matt Damon does a great job in playing a character that everyone is trying to save (he always seems to be playing a character that everyone is trying to save or everyone is trying to kill)
One thing that I do think weighs this movie down, and why it's a 9/10 and not a 10/10, is all the swearing. I can understand some swearing here and there, but it does get to a point in the Martian that the swearing feels gratuitous and can detract a bit to a lot from the viewing experience depending on how much you do or don't mind swearing in movies.
Other than that I'd say the movie is fairly accurate to the book, and it's extremely well done, and is a definite must watch if you like it when movies at least try to put a good effort into being as realistic as possible.9/10 would recommend."
38," This is a rare, light-hearted science fiction film.
","This is a rare, light-hearted science fiction film that deliberately downplays the most common fears about the future and the unknown universe, focusing instead on human effort and the science that can save humanity.The film has a tech-geek's idiocy and optimism. (Matt Damon, of course, did it perfectly.)Even if the movie is a little bit stereotypical in its emotional setting, it can still touch the audience at crucial moments."
39," A film for kids. PC ridden and cliché bound.
","What is it about directors that they have to stoop to the very worst of clichés when making ""space"" films? I'm old enough to have seen ""2001"" when it first came out and it seems to me that far from emulating Kubrick's marvellous film Ridley Scott has regressed to some kind of Boy's Own adventure movies style - but peopled with every kind of PC cliché and dialogue that constantly sets this viewer's teeth on edge. Here's the scruffy ethnic that lives in a pile of mess but has worked out how to save the stranded astronaut - and develops his idea in the most childish way even though most of us had worked it out a good hour beforehand, Gruff Sean Bean growls and fights against the system. Pretty female astronauts are in control, a teenage NASA technician (female) spots something none of the more experienced men in real life would have noticed at the drop of a hat, the hideously white NASA director is stupid but the USA's new friends - the Chinese - come to the rescue. The scenes of jubilation in Times Square, Trafalgar Square and somewhere in China with massed crowds waiting with bated breath as the ""live"" rescue mission is beamed directly on to large screens is just pure nonsense. Pretty landscapes. Pity about the people, the dialogue, the plot and the suffocating PC-ness of it all."
40," safe,dull and ... predictable
","I went to see the martian with high expectations,hoping to get a story that will take you by your throat keeps you on the tip of your seat and thrill you,surprise you...etc etc...i got nothing of the above!! instead i watched a very dull,predictable and very safe movie,Matt Damon,i really love as an actor but he never got to me,i simply was not taken by his acting,it just did not come across,the surrounding characters were so predictable,the young and beautiful captain,another young chick and a science head...the happy Latino...a German...oh please give me a break,who wrote this,and sorry to say but the name Ridley Scott seems to disappoint me more and more the last years.The scene where his garden gets blown away i saw coming from a mile,the science well,that was nicely done for a 10year your kid,but for me it looked like a Sunday afternoon cable movie,safe and predictable.There were so many things they could have done differently,also the music did nothing good for it.the photography could have been done so much better...i am very disappointed."
41," Most boring movie of the year, by far.
","2 hours and 21 minutes of Matt Damon gardening, and people at NASA discussing how to rescue him. Seriously. That's the whole movie. Total boredom.Just so you know, I like all kinds of movies. I'm not impatient. I have a degree in a tech field. But geez, this movie is soooo boring.And it's stupid!! And the casting is terrible. A 22-year-old hot model-type woman is the only one at NASA smart enough to locate Damon. And a 22-year-old slob who looks like he's strung-out on drugs (rolling out of a bed in his FILTHY MESSY office, twitching, shaking, stuttering) is the only one at NASA smart enough to think of using a slingshot-effect for the rocket. But they're SOOOO smart that they can attend high-level, and I'm talking the highest level on a national scale....they can attend these meetings in street clothes, while everyone else is in suits and ties.I know Damon is extremely politically-correct, and so are most Hollywood movies these days. But this one goes too far. Literally every scene alternates between a person of a different race. White, African-American, African, Hispanic, Asian, Middle Eastern. And every scene has a man and a woman in it. Michael Pena as an astronaut?? Hello....do I really need to explain that you have to be in-shape to be an astronaut??"
42," It truly is impossible to please everyone isn't it?
","First off I just want to stress that this is absolutely the kind of film you want to see on the big screen; don't wait for it to come out on DVD! The Mars landscape is truly stunning and the visual effects look fantastic.I didn't really know what to expect when walking into the cinema today. I knew it was about some guy getting stuck on Mars, but that's about it. I had no idea that what I was about to watch would end up being one of my favourite movies of the year.The whole of planet Earth is trying to help Mark get home after he's been left behind on Mars and presumed dead. You can clearly see the emotion of those at the NASA command centre who are pulling all their resources together to make it work. The dedication and loyalty of Mark's crew is captivating as they come up with an idea to supersede NASA's original plan and swing the Hermes around the Earth and back towards Mars to pick their fellow astronaut up.And, of course, there are Mark's struggles on Mars. This botanical genius of an astronaut is forced to grow his own food and ration his resources so that he can survive long enough for help to arrive. His creativity, innovations, and breadth of knowledge undoubtedly save his life in this impossible situation. I lost count of how many times the cinema erupted into laughter. There were so many clever lines and witty comments that you couldn't leave the cinema without a smile on your face. But despite the comedy, this film was able to be very gripping and tense when it needed to be: Mark removing the shrapnel from his stomach, NASA's failed attempt to launch the supply probe, the malfunction in the base on Mars leading to all of his work being ruined, and the Hermes crew desperately trying everything they can to readjust their course towards Mark are all great examples of where The Martian excels dramatically.I also really liked that they were able to show the effect of such severe rationing: Mark loses substantial weight and muscle (I know it was a body-double, but still the effect is the same). In addition, the visible tooth decay was a nice touch which just goes to show how polished and attentive to detail the film is.Needless to say, the cast was phenomenal: Matt Damon (Bourne), Jeff Daniels (The Newsroom), Sean Bean (Game of Thrones), Kate Mara (House of Cards), and Chiwetel Ejiofor (12 Years a Slave) just to name a few.Several of the criticisms I have seen of this film are, to me, actually its strengths: the main protagonist who isn't concerned with his family back home (thank goodness it wasn't another cliché where he has a family that he oh-so-desperately needs to get back to), the length of the film (Interstellar, I would say, was bordering on too long, whereas Gravity seemed a bit short - The Martian felt just right), and the comedic element (to me, the comedy is what makes this film stand out - it is integral to its success - just like with The Edge of Tomorrow).And, as with all Ridley Scott films, the pacing was excellent. The plot didn't seem too rushed, but it didn't drag on either. Perfectly executed.If you enjoy good storytelling, excellent acting, stunning visuals, comedy, drama, and survival, then you can be sure to enjoy this movie as much as I did!"
43," Futurism and Nostalgia
","From the earliest days of cinema, films have explored what man can do when cut off from society (and indeed, the interest of the topic pre-dates the art form: think how long ago Robinson Crusoe was written). But in a world ever more monitored, depictions of life beyond borders are often set in space. These include both fictional tales and true stories. 'Apollo 13', for example, is a riveting film, but mainly because of its raw material: in 1971, a manned space mission suffered from an explosion and the astronauts were stranded, thousands of miles from help; amazingly, they managed to fix their stricken craft and make it home alive.'The Martian' is a fictional story, but is in some ways Apollo 13-redux. It starts with a gripping scene where, post-disaster, the hero is forced to operate on himself: gripping, yes, but also not a scene that needs to be set on Mars. And subsequently, it can't quite live up to this compelling start. As I see it, there are three main problems. Firstly, some implausible science (how can you grow plants without carbon dioxide in the atmosphere?) and psychology (the story is set over a period of years, but we never really get the impression that the character is stranded alone for so long). Secondly, the need for the Hollywood virtues where force of character compels eventual triumph. And finally, perhaps, that the remarkable thing about Apollo 13 is not that its crew could have saved themselves, but that they did: the triumph was not one over the laws of physics, but rather a win against the odds. In a fictional story, this is a less compelling narrative structure: why does the character get repeatedly lucky? Simply because the screenwriters wrote it that way.Yet in spite of its faults, the film's basic set up draws you in, and by the (admittedly melodramatic) rescue scenes, one can't help but watch on the edge of one's seat; and keeping an audience interested for over two hours is not such an easy thing to do. Perhaps the fact that in the real world we've basically given up on manned space travel adds to the appeal: this may be a futuristic story, but at the same time, it also feels like a tale of something we used to do, to boldly go beyond the limits of our planet to see what we might find."
44," Competently Made But Felt Empty
","This film made me feel neutral. I found the using-science-to-solve-problems aspect interesting but that isn't what makes a film resonate with me. It's the characters. The characters in this film do not feel like people. They feel empty. Sure, Mark Watney, the lead played by Matt Damon, has a personality I guess. We learn early on that he is an easy-going guy who can remain calm in most stressful situations. However, there isn't much else to him. I had no reason to connect to him. No one bothered to give him any sort of arc or background. He doesn't change or grow as a person at all. I know not every protagonist has to go through some sort of change but this character could have with at least a little bit of internal conflict. This applies to the rest of the cast as well. Only four characters in the film stood out to me in anyway: Watney, Rich Purnell (Donald Glover), Vincent Kapoor (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and Michael Peña's character. Watney because he is, I suppose, more well rounded than the rest of the cast; Purnell because an archetypal quirky genius character is better than no character at all; Kapoor because his skills in communication and persuasion make him stand out which is a required quality for his job (Mars mission director, I had to look it up on Wikipedia); and Peña's character because of the two tiny moments of banter between him and Watney. Everyone else is defined by their jobs (which I've forgotten for the most part anyway) and what actions they need to do for their job. When it comes to technical aspects, nothing was really done badly but nothing was done exceptionally either. The direction served its purpose but didn't impress. The cast did a pretty good job in their roles but no one made up for their lacklustre* characters. The visual effects are good. Granted, nothing stood out but that wasn't the purpose. They're supposed to make the spectacle look convincing, and they accomplish that. Lastly, I would like to mention the score. Throughout most of the film, I didn't really pay attention to it but in the first few scenes when Watney is stranded on Mars, I felt that the music was too overdramatic. This probably isn't that much of a problem as I forgot about it quickly but it's distracting when the score is too intense or emotional for the scene it's accompanying.Overall, this film neither impressed nor annoyed me. It's competently well made but it feels empty. If either the premise or the problem solving aspect interests you, you might like it. Otherwise, you can skip it.*That's the British spelling of ""lackluster"" apparently.http://letterboxd.com/lloyd_morgan/film/the-martian/"
45," Clean, precise and not so unique
","As always, Riddley Scott delivered another visually beautiful science fiction piece, with all the ingredients to make it a commercial success.From top acting names, to state of the art VFX, there is not much bad that you could say about this movie. Unfortunately, the fact is that this story is not really new. In fact it is really old. A guy stranded on a desolate inhospitable place, who tries to survive against all odds? Come on!! I would go to see this movie with different expectations, it it wasn't so heavily advertised as a masterpiece. Which it really isn't. The movie is just fun, with sprinkle of comedy and heavy dose of pathetic closeups of Matt, Jessica and rest of the crew. I guess all that money spent had to payoff, so what's better way than to make it appealing to wide audience, from kids to grandparents. And that is OK. But I cannot escape the feeling that R. Scott has lost the pace with modern times, and brought a little archaic style to this movie. Satisfied but not impressed. That is my final judgement.Good 2 hrs of fun."
46," Riddley Scott's decadence
","The decadence of Ridley Scott in my opinion. The one who offered us some great movies (""Allien"" is enough I believe to make the comparison and point out the importance of a good scenario and small budget to create a ""great"" movie). The whole movie hasn't created, to me at least, the feeling of agony and suspense that was meant to create and I cannot understand the dithyrambic critics (8.2 IMDb score?).More it was a movie like ""Indepedence Day"", where the ""good guys"" win nomatter what.....A great disappointment from Ridley Scott and a movie that did not offer anything new, from a director that has created collosal movies in the past (what to count first: Blade Runner, Allien, Gladiator..... 0."
47," Predictable and disappointing
","I don't really understand all the hype behind this movie. Maybe it's because I've heard the book was so good that this movie created some buzz before its release. I normally enjoy sci fi movies and I am generally a fan of Ridley Scott. I enjoy being moved by great acting performances and being awed by the mysteriousness and the unknown this type of genre is able to project on the big screen. However, this movie did none of the above for me. Although Matt Damon is an excellent actor, it was difficult for me to fully buy into his character. Despite being alone and stranded on Mars, he lacked emotion and credibility. The other characters in this movie fell flat, too. The biggest disappointments were Kristen Wiig and Jeff Daniels – it was too one dimensional, lacked versatility, and was to cliché. Actually, the plot was very cliché and was very predictable. And the special effects and action sequences were far too similar to what we saw in Prometheus. I guess I expected more with this cast and director but was left wanting so much more."
48," boring unlikely politically correct
","OK, this is really a very very bad movie. And on several levels. Matt Damon plays awfully bad. Well this is no news, he is an awful actor, but stillHe is in this movie so emotionally numb. The scenario is really not suspenseful. Most of the scientific facts are just thrown at your head like if you were totally stupid and know nothing. All the scenario is totally unlikely. And I don't speak about the political correctness (black, Chinese everybody is there) that is really an insult to intelligence. Finally I can say that the film had beautiful images. This is the only thing I can say positive. That's all. Conclusion : this movie is a waste of time. I have already forgotten it. Man where are the SF films like Alien"
49," Blah
","Personally didn't like the movie very much. In my opinion there was way to much Humor for a Sci-fi drama. I felt like the main character ( Matt Damon) didn't capture someone actually stranded in a life or death situation. Compared to Interstellar this movie was a flop. Had no emotional attachment to any of the main characters. This movie was extremely "" Hollywoodized "" with an unreasonable amount of impossible ""WTF"" moments. I knew from the 1st couple minutes the entire script and how some characters would act ( predictable ). Id rather see a more realistic version without the humor. I'm no movie critic just a un- educated bottom feeder."
50," Really?
","I like sci-fi as a genre but I completely hate it when film makers assume a general level of dumbness in their audience and resultantly try to peddle whatever they think can sell. I am appalled both by the movie as well as the number of people here on IMDb who actually found the movie worthwhile. I am not even going into the scientific aspects of what Whatney did and whether or not the fiction was any close to truth. In general, I don't like to poke holes in sci-fi, simply because the second word is 'fiction'. What got me was just the childish and rather superficial treatment accorded to everything. Not once did you feel for Whatney or any of the other crew members. The dialogue is gcheesy, bordering on inane. Clichés abound - there is a half-hindu (a separate dialogue was introduced in the movie just to highlight this fact) good-natured scientist and helpful Chinese space agency to boot. Even the special effects are underwhelming. There are instances where you can quite clearly see and feel its a toy car on the red soil. I think Hollywood is running out of ideas, 2015 has generally been god-awful and Martian is just another on that list."
51," Not as great as I expected
","I was somewhat disappointed by 'The Martian', maybe because I had such high expectations of it. In my opinion the movie failed to really immerse you into the action or make you feel the danger of space, the way that for example 'Gravity' did.Also, it came across as feel-good NASA propaganda. Maybe that one is on me for being so cynical, I am not sure. The attempts at humor never made me laugh and sometimes made me feel embarrassed.I am not saying that it is a bad movie. I liked its realistic and scientific approach. There should be more sci-fi movies done in such an earnest way. However, in my experience 'The Martian' does not succeed in truly captivating or intriguing you."
52," Enjoyable, albeit, overrated.
","I saw this film on it's opening night, with a group of friends from work. The film's beginning drew me in, and Matt Damon's lighthearted humor was quite amusing.That being said, the formulaic plot, lack of character development outside of Matt Damon's character, and eventually tiring jokes wore me out by the end of the movie. It must've been a decent film, since I did find myself laughing now and then, and I also found myself rooting for Matt Damon. That said, it's a highly forgettable flick, and I don't understand why it's so beloved.Watch it if you have the chance, but don't expect an incredible film."
53," Marring a great story
","REVIEW OF MARTIAN MOVIEI will start by saying that I read the book this is based on. I am not one of those people who always think the book is better than the movie; American Psycho is one of my favorite movies and I think Christian Bale's performance along with Mary Harmon's direction make it more enjoyable than the book (although the book is more twisted and perhaps a bit deeper).To summarize my review, the movie-making establishment has yet again marred an interesting and inspiring story. The book had a wonderfully realist and analytical view of a marooning story, which was over-glamorized and under-directed by the director (shame on Ridley Scott). The faults can be found in this adaptation in every aspect of the film. It should be considered a disappointment and the only saving grace is the original story, which should have a much better movie made of it some day. If I am ever in the position to make it, I will.Let's start with the casting. Matt Damon is a fantastic actor but this is not a role for him. In the book, Mark Watney is an engineer sent to space and, truthfully, a nerd. As smart as I know Matt Damon to be and as many intelligent roles as he has had, he does not personify the Watney from the book. He does the serious parts pretty well (although it sounds like he is dumbing it down all the time, which is probably the screen writing's fault) but as soon as he tries to tell a Watney joke, it falls flat. That's because he isn't nailing the role. In my mind, the main role should go to someone who is nerdy and who can pull off sarcasm better. I would go with an unrecognizable actor who fits the role because what I loved about the book was how I felt like I rediscovered how cool engineering is, not how cool Matt Damon is.The rest of the cast is also terrible. Most of the actors and actresses are just your stockyard Hollywood actors; pretty and over-dramatic. Of all the parts, Vincent Kapoor and Bruce Nguyen are actually well-acted, maybe Teddy. Otherwise, you could replace any one of those actors with another and it wouldn't change much.Then let's go to the set design and cinematography. Space travel is not glamorous, nor should it be portrayed in that way. Even Interstellar overdoes it, and I believe what made the story of the Martian so great was how real it felt. It's like reading a biography. Spaceships shouldn't have extra space in the hallways (the Hermes is huge), the ""gym"" room shouldn't exist (think of the actual international space-station's set up; the treadmill just extends down from the wall), and the HAB and Hermes have ridiculous amounts of internal volume. Every cubic inch of space inside a shuttle costs a ridiculous amount of money. It makes moot points that Teddy has against creating another Ares mission when they are spending extra money on a crazy T-shaped table for discussions for a ship with 6 crew.Also, in reality, graphical user interfaces (GUIs) don't animate like they do in the movie; that serves no purpose in reality. They should also not be uniformly blue all the time. They also don't project onto people's faces. Also, NASA doesn't have fancy lecture halls with light bars around the desks and a metal engraved floor (I'm pretty sure); it is probably pretty basic since they should be spending their money on space exploration. All of these things pull me away from the story, which is in essence, how do you survive when you have nothing and nobody. Surrounded by all this beautifully but insensibly designed technology and space, why should we feel for this astronaut? If movie makers were to tell a story about the colonization of America, would they all be wearing dry cleaned, beautifully sewn dresses and have a big old yacht with plenty of space for everyone to hang out? Why doesn't Mark Watney's spacesuit have any dirt on it after 2 years on a dry, dirt covered planet?A small note about sound design: interfaces also don't beep like they do in this movie. Also, bombs made in 39 minutes attached to a lighting panel do not beep as if on a timer (why waste time on that). I feel that none of these things add to the story as I'd love it and serve to detract from the realism of it. Want to make a good movie about traveling to Mars? Make it feel real. Direct it as if it were a documentary. Think like Kubrick did 40 years ago: Does space have sound? Do spaceship GUIs only have one color when representing complex data? Ridiculous.Lastly, they butchered the book. They cut out or shortened all of the bits that actually make this story interesting. Driving for 3200km on a planet no one else exists on deserves more than a footnote. How about when the rover crashes entering the crater? That was the suspense of the ending. Loneliness; feeling like he missed his window. Where is that in the movie? Every time there is some over-dramatic pause in the film, take that out and replace it with some part of the story that was actually written.Overall, it's sad because I was excited to see this movie having loved the book. It's even more sad that people might think that the book wasn't that great because the movie was even just on par. Hollywood, you ruined another story, I just wish people would stop paying you to do it."
54," A unique, visually styled film that's still not the sum of its parts
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning During an outer space mission around Mars, astronaut Matt Watney (Matt Damon) is separated from his spacecraft, and is presumed dead in the immediate aftermath. Stranded many light years from his home planet, Mark is forced to use his survival training (including fertilising faeces for food!) in order to survive, before managing to contact Earth and bring news of his survival to NASA president Teddy Sanders (Jeff Daniels), who desperately works on Earth with scientist Vincent Kapoor (Chiwetel Ejiofor) to get him home, while re-assuring a frantic public.Having made his name in a landmark sci-fi classic many decades ago, Ridley Scott returns to the genre for a film where the only alien appears to be in human form. His ability to create an impressive visual spectacle doesn't seem to have diminished with time, and The Martian features some sets and designs in outer space that could quite blow your mind. The director oversteps any meaningful character development, and plunges us straight into a story that serves as a lengthier rendition of 2013's Gravity, with elements of Tom Hanks's Cast Away chucked in for good measure.For a film stretching at nearly two and a half hours, it really needed not just an interesting story, but an effective screenplay to match it. While the 'one man stranded in space' plot still has some life in it, Scott seems overly preoccupied with stuffing Damon's Watson character full of insightful technical jargon and waffle, to reassure us he's highly intelligent and 'NASA's finest', to the point of disconnection. To try and balance the script with some humour, Scott has displayed an affection for '70s disco music, which Damon must awkwardly eschew. It's a welcome touch, if not truly effective.Performances wise, Damon must carry the lengthy film almost singlehandedly, and it's his varying degrees as an actor that make as little or most of this. While a better actor could have made more of it, by turns a weaker actor could have made it worse, and so you're grateful for small mercies. In what could be the main supporting role, Daniels is grounded as the head of NASA but, in a film determined to have as much humour as drama, that role he took with Jim Carrey all those years ago (and recently reprised) can never get out your mind. A further colourful supporting cast further make it up, including Michael Pena, Sean Bean and Ejiofor.Overall, it's not an entirely unsuccessful film, just one without the genuine tension and suspense to really make it last as long as it does, and so the cracks do appear at times. ***"
55," Going Mars is now fun
","The movie started just like any other adventure movie. The trailer promised a really intriguing story line. This movie is based on a book and for me many things were made differently than the book. Matt Damon was usual a perfect choice for the role. He had to portray the struggle and willingness to survive alone in an absolutely no mans land. I liked the acting of everyone but the plot line was not very interesting. It was very common and obvious that the crew who left him will go and save him at some point and everything will be alright at the end. I watch the 1080p version (i think) and the VFX was magnificent and was true to the story. All in all, it was a good time pass movie, not at all boring and fun to watch"
56," A True Love Letter to Science and Humanity
","Sir Ridley Scott is finally back on track. There's no argument that his last couple films have not been up to his standard. However, now he has gone back to his roots to bring us an adaptation of the sci-fi novel by Andy Weir The Martian.The story itself is pretty straightforward. Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is presumed dead when stuck with debris during a storm on Mars. When the rest of his crew decides to abort and he turns out to be alive, Watney must ration his remaining resources in an attempt to same himself and make contact with NASA. Despite the familiar storyline (can you say Cast Away meets Apollo 13?), only a true mastermind behind the camera can give the story so much depth and make it so enthralling. The cast is definitely one of the best ensembles of the year. Everyone does fantastic with the roles given to them, namely Chiwetel Ejiofor and Jeff Daniels. And while everyone does a great job in the movie, the man whose shoulders the film truly rests on is Matt Damon, and he excels in every scene he is in. The audience is always eager to follow Damon's successes and failures on Mars. Damon is so good at playing a wise- cracking scientist and showing us what it might actually be like to get left on Mars alone. With Damon's character, the movie is allowed to delve into themes about what makes us human and our drive to help one another.One of the aspects of the film that truly fascinated me was how much science was explained out in the movie. The science is always intriguing and never makes one feel as though they are in school needing to remember everything they heard. The Martian is easily one of the best films of the year and a very welcome return to form for Sir Ridley Scott. The entire cast excels at bringing the audience a fascinating trip not only of the inner-workings of NASA, but of a man's journey of survival as he is left on Mars.""I admit it's fatally dangerous, but I'd get to fly around like Iron Man"""
57," Mark's Adventure
","The movie ""The Martian"" is about an astronaut, Mark Watney who got stuck on Mars. It is a movie based on a novel by Andy Weir and the main character is played by Matt Damon. How did he survive after the accident? Let's find out.This movie began with a big sand storm. The Ares crew and Mark Watney were collecting samples of stones and dirt, when suddenly a sand storm came. Mark and the crew were separated by it. A metal stick stabbed Mark's body and the crew thought Mark was dead. To protect the other crew members, the commander forced the crew to abort the mission and Mark was left behind on Mars! The following day, when Mark woke up, he found he was alone on Mars. He wanted to survive on Mars; it's lucky that Mark is a botanist, he knew how to grow potatoes and make water by himself. He began to survive on this planet with very little water or food.One day, an engineer named Mindy Park found two satellite photos were different; the solar panels had been moved! The director Vincent Kapoor knew that Mark had survived. They wanted to save Mark's life, but the NASA director Teddy Sanders didn't agree. To rescue Mark, Mitch Henderson, who was the flight director of the Ares 3 Mission, used a special code to tell the Ares crew that Mark was still alive. Mitch wanted the crew to decide if they wanted to save Mark or not.In the end, the crew and Mark meet again. I felt so excited about their reunion. I liked the movie very much! The CG and story-line are very interesting, but most of all, the music - disco - is my favorite! I love it so much!"
58," A low-key triumph on a massive budget
","Ridley Scott's new film ""The Martian"" does not mess around with buildup or anything in the way of expository drama; it gets right to the point and recognizes why you came to see it. It opens with Ares III, NASA's manned mission to Mars, experiencing a treacherous storm upon arriving on the red planet. Debris is flying and visibility is next to nothing, and before the astronauts (Jessica Chastain, Michael Peña, and Kate Mara) can take off, fellow astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is struck by a flying antenna and presumed killed. The group takes off with the notion that Watney is dead.Following NASA head Teddy Sanders (Jeff Daniels) making the announcement of Watney's death, we see that Watney is indeed very much alive on Mars, albeit slightly handicapped after being impaled in the stomach by the antenna. Watney now has to essentially operate on a field of landmines whilst acting as a scientist MacGyver to try and sustain life on Mars, a place where presumably nothing grows and anything can go wrong at any time. In addition to monitoring water reclamation, oxygen, and atmospheric levels, he winds up growing an array of potatoes with the help of the feces of him and his crew and makes a small home for himself. It will over four years for another manned mission to rescue him, but NASA headquarters, comprised of Sanders and assistants like Vincent (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and Annie (Kristen Wiig), is determined to bring him back home in a timely fashion.Headquarters is also struggling with the idea of telling the surviving members of the Ares III mission that Watney is alive, which ignites a fiery ethical side to the film's story. With that, ""The Martian"" is essentially a gigantic teamwork exercise where everyone feels human, which is a pleasant attribute for Scott, whose recent films have really lacked in the filmmaking craft and humanization elements. Scott's visual effects and grandscale directing usually never fail, but when these become the focus and human characters and the little touches (the science, the cause-and-effect relationships, and the narrative interest) become secondary or gravely shortchanged, then there's a real issue with his films on a macro level.""The Martian,"" even with its nearly two and a half hour runtime, remains consistently interesting because it's a generally optimistic film, surprisingly enough. Watney is a wisecracker a lot of the time, even in the face of certain doom, and seeing NASA's constant efforts to bring him home show a certain diligence on their behalf works to make this film surprisingly hopeful. Then there's the roundtable of rich performances here; aside from Damon, who does solid work being the only actor on-screen in his scenes for his sheer honesty mixed with vulnerability, Daniels and Ejiofor work off of each other incredibly well together here.Consider the scene following Ares III's escape from Mars during the storm, when Watney is still presumed dead; the two consult one another about what to do with Watney's remains whilst subsequently trying to find a way to turn it into a more positive, caring PR display by sending another mission out to recover his corpse. This is a perfect scene in the way that it shows the way corporations and organizations balance humanity while considering their bottom-line, and who better to play figures in those pivotal positions of power than Daniels, who's work on ""The Newsroom"" has gone on to be acclaimed, and Ejiofor, who, much like David Oyelowo, will likely win an Oscar in the next ten years.Aside from a reliance on montages instead of actual exposition, ""The Martian""'s biggest problem as a film is the fact that we simply do not get enough time with Watney alone. The audience can never get a strong grasp on a relationship with this character simply because we're never allotted enough one-on-one time without the intrusion of mission control. We needed more scenes with Watney ostensibly helpless, trying to farm, or simply trying to get by on what little he has to surround himself and the film doesn't do that.""The Martian"" also makes fairly strong use of its 3D elements, using it as a tool of immersion rather than a gimmick that works to add a surcharge to already high movie ticket prices. Consider the storm scene, which completely floods the screen with indiscernible debris and disarray; the scene is only emphasized with the benefit of 3D and makes the experience that much more horrifying, being that, like the characters, we can barely see a thing.Above all, this is a film destined to please a crowd; in addition, it also keeps its pathos down considerably, doesn't do a whole lot of pandering to a crowd anxious to see action, and never loses sight of its deeply human and remarkable story. It also reaffirms the value of logical problem-solving in the face of a truly unexpected, and granted unprecedented, time of tumultuous uncertainty. It's a low-key triumph made on a nine figure budget."
59," Touching but dull
","The story about Mark Watney, an astronaut in the future that is left on Mars, when his crew mistakingly leave him behind. I had expected huge things from this movie, it started very well, but then it came quite boring, there is only so much solo time one man can do on the film. The other characters were not too interesting, except for Vincent and Bruce, the only two likable. Matt Damon is a very good actor, much better news that he is doing another Jason Bourne film. The Martian is watchable but what is the problem is the ending, it was really badly done, the film was credible up to then. Best thing about the movie were the special effects, the film looks good."
60," Preachy, sanctimonious bull crap
","People go to the cinema to be entertained, not to be schooled by people who have no idea what are they talking about. And on top of everything: why do you have to add politics and forced multiculturalism to every movie?! Is there a committee in Hollywood who demands that every single movie has to include multiculturalism, forced, not funny jokes, American flag, American nationalism, women who are good leaders?! It's like all the movies were written by the same people, all the effects done by the same crew, time to change Hollywood! Ridley Scott how could you? This movie is not entertaining, it's full of politics and preachy bull crap."
61," Movie Vs. Book: The Martian
","During a manned mission to Mars, Astronaut Mark Watney is presumed dead after a fierce storm and left behind by his crew. But Watney has survived and finds himself stranded and alone on the hostile planet. With only meagre supplies, he must draw upon his ingenuity, wit and spirit to subsist and find a way to signal to Earth that he is alive.Andy Weir started writing a book about an astronaut stranded on Mars. He hadn't had any success with publishers in the past, so he begun posting chapters to his website. That was 2011. People really liked it - so much that Crown Publishing made it become a best-seller. Weir tells this story through largely detailed work logs. The Martian is impressively geeky. Smart science-fiction is such a rarity these days. Our parents witnessed the first man in the Moon decades ago and we witnessed the landing of curiosity on Mars: WE are the Mars generation. That's the inspiration. Astronauts really are the real pioneers. They do something incredibly heroic, brave and risky but also incredibly necessary. This book is adapted by Ridley Scott, who transformed science-fiction cinema with Blade Runner and Alien. Once again, Scott goes back to the future, which is a familiar destination for him. Andy Weir and screenplay writers wrote us a love letter to science. They obviously skipped a lot of complications in the film, there's so much in the book but they decide to pick out some bits and leave others which is natural and not a problem at all. You definitely don't need to have read the book to enjoy the movie but you definitely SHOULD read the book because it's fantastic! Mr Weir, from online serial to book to screen, has brought a little appreciated genre into the mainstream: the nerd thriller. This hyper-technical genre, deeply developed by novelists does something that classic thrillers do not: it puts the nerd (female or male) in the centre of the action. The intellectual is the hero. Imagine that instead of Tom Cruise, Simon Pegg was the star of Mission: Impossible. This is an adventure for those of us who believe, deep in our hearts, that the heroes of Star Trek are Spock and Scotty: the science officer and the engineer. And writing about The Martian seems to be bringing out the geekiness even more in your humble correspondent. Still its heart, humour and rousing story of perseverance and global collaboration promise to broaden the film's appeal well beyond nerds. A lot of people - including myself - responded to the characters in the book. The humour and the way he keeps his logical, practical spirit in order to solve one problem at a time; is what makes this character compelling and super duper interesting. Andy Weir admits freely that his character has little inner life. Watney simply pushes forward, putting crises into a mental lock box and figuring out how to survive. ""It could have been a deep psychological thing"", he said ""but that's not the kind of book I like to read and it's not the kind of book I wanted to write"". Engineer at NASA - who are hoping to get people to Mars someday - said Mr Weir has captured something important about what make Humans want to explore. Mark Watney character represents the very cutting edge of humanity and what's possible and what we know we all need someday; which is move some of the species off the planet to ensure the species survival. Nowadays still, there are people working toward that goal. ""Watney's everybody's favourite"" because he's the brave, resourceful American optimist. We all know a smart ass nerd just like him. Moreover, if you're going to be stuck alone with an actor, who guides you through a story with nothing but video diaries, you need someone who can exude the right amount of humour and confidence. In significant measure due to his character's mordant humour, Matt Damon provides a very good company during the long stretches when he's on screen alone. Plus the actor's physicality makes Mark's capability entirely credible. Matt Damon has the charm and wit to land the tricky one-liners. You try making ""Fuck you, Mars!"" sound cool. From there Watney must not only come to grips with the most dire situation any astronaut has ever faced, but also mends his own gory abdominal wound in a scene that is Prometheus-level in its guts wrenching body horror. Watney is supposedly a symbol of hope for all humanity in the final act. Creating at the same time a new Manifest Destiny. This movie is the Die Hard of space film. Matt Damon gets stab, he gets frozen, he gets exploded and even burnt. Scenes back on Earth provide a hectic, densely populated counterweight to the Martian aridity. The rest of the cast is diverse in a way that feels genuinely authentic. In the story the rest of us on Earth have this understanding of what this man sacrificed and the beauty of that. They do everything they can to bring him back because he represents the best of us all. However (...) > Head over to my blog to read more about The Martian"
62," One of the best movies I know
","Fantastic film about determination, perseverance, optimism, faith, leadership, collaboration and initiative. It reminded me a bit of the atmosphere in the movie Apollo 13. But with more action en with more interesting personages. Matt Damon is at his best: about 40% of the movie he is acting alone. In the movie NASA is as cool as one would expect and there are nice references to the real world. Good, if not great acting of experienced top-actors and excellent directing and editing. It's a long movie, which manages to keep you on full alert the whole 2.5 hours.The 3D effects are nicely done: the scenes look razor-sharp and realistic: the Martian scenes make one really believe that you're on Mars, the space equipment is also very believable and the camera work is very good.The only thing I found missing was that there was no story at all about the family of the astronaut."
63," horrible
",it's so pathetic and slow....they play that trumpet violin triumph music whenever the astronauts twitch a muscle and everybody starts clapping and cheering like they figured out how to turn sh*t into gold the ending is awful too really cliché they just sensationalize the whole thing you know what i mean? they also failed miserably while trying to incorporate humor into the movie because the jokes were so bad i wanted to cry i don't think i even smirked throughout and it has an 8.3 on IMDb its disgraceful please do not watch under any circumstance unless you're fed up of life and want throw away a couple of hours you have been warned please also warn your friends family and other loved ones p*ss poor excuse for a movie
64," No character development or introspection
","For all the excitement, awe, and energy that are worked up in Ridley Scott's The Martian, the story might just as well have taken place in New York's Central Park with the hero stuck up in a tree. Instead of the sense of mystery and wonder (and terror) that could be expected from being stranded on a different world, what we have are buckets full of the down-to-earth (or up-to-Mars), nitty-gritty practicalities of science and a predictable plot that leaves no room for character development or introspection. In the story, written by Drew Goddard and based on the 2011 novel by Andy Weir, science is the redeemed and the redeemer, the hero and the heroine, the beginning and the end.Shot in 3-D, the film's fictional aspect is established almost immediately when we find out that NASA is actually engaged in space exploration rather than tallying up its budget deficit. Though we are not told the purpose of the Ares III manned mission to Mars, we know soon enough that the crew is forced to abandon their plans when they discover that a huge life-threatening sandstorm is fast approaching. Like Home Alone, the crew takes off for home but - wait a minute - they forgot Kevin. In this case, Kevin is fellow crew member Mark Watney, played with excruciating blandness by Matt Damon. Watney, presumed to be dead after the storm strikes, turns the tables on the departed crew and decides to stay alive, though according to his best judgment, his reprieve will only be temporary.Watney must use his ingenuity and skills as a Botanist to solve his food problems to stay alive, but that is not his only concern. He has no way to communicate with Earth, knows that the next planned Mars mission will not be for four years, and that the landing spot on Mars is 3,200 kilometers away. As Watney explains in his video diaries, to survive he is going to have to ""science the s..t out of this."" He first makes changes to the Rover, his only vehicle, to allow for longer trips and then sets about growing potatoes in an artificial environment. Whether he likes potatoes or not, they are now his only source of nourishment and means of survival. The subject of embarrassingly phony eulogies back on Earth, NASA is shocked when satellite photos of Mars reveal that Watney has defied the odds and is still alive.The crew returning home on the Hermes spacecraft are not informed, however, to avoid distracting them from their flight - a decision made by NASA director Terry Sanders, played by a miscast Jeff Daniels. When Sanders, marketing chief Annie (Kristen Wiig) and NASA mission director Vincent (Chiwetel Ejiofor) find out that Mark is alive, they must find a way to ""Bring Him Home"" or else the film's promotional department will get very upset. Eventually, Watney finds a way to talk to NASA by using communications devices from the Pathfinder probe, dormant since 1997, but the film provides little insight into Watney's character and he seems to be emotionally unaffected by his plight, telling lame jokes as if he was planting potatoes in his back yard.The more interesting story takes place at Houston's Johnson Space Center where plans are underway to send a probe to Mars to resupply Watney so he can last another several years on the planet, then return to the spacecraft carrying colleagues Mitch Henderson (Sean Bean), Rick Martinez (Michael Peña), Beth Johanssen (Kate Mara), Chris Beck (Sebastian Stan) and Alex Vogel (Aksel Hennie). After the launch ends up in disaster, help arrives via the Chinese space program and the Ares III crew itself must now make a crucial decision that has life or death consequences. The Martian has some fine technical achievements including breathtaking vistas of the Martian landscape by cinematographer Dariusz Wolsky and it is an entertaining film, yet all its achievements are subsumed in an atmosphere as exciting as a how-to-manual.Disco music left behind by Commander Melissa Lewis (Jessica Chastain) such as songs by David Bowie and Gloria Gaynor, attempt to enhance the film's entertainment quotient and appeal to younger viewers but they only serve to distract viewers from whatever reality the story has. To its credit, The Martian has a humane message empowered by the enormity of the cooperation required to attempt to save the life of one man and it reminds us of the days when we all had a common purpose, yet the film lacks conviction and never moves past banal dialogue such as ""YES"", ""let's do it,"" and all the standard clichés of triumphalism. While Damon may have scienced the s..t out of his predicament, the film has also succeeded in sciencing the beauty out of it."
65," lame copy of very old ideas
","to name a few: Robinson Crusoe, Mission To Mars (2000), Robinson Crusoe on Mars (1964) whereas Andy Weir's novel is a blatant theft of those ideas as well as it is the script of The Martian, . . . etc.To give the very unoriginal story some gravity, the prominent cast obviously was the means of choice. This movie was solely developed as a typical Hollywood cash cow with pretty faces and implausibly characters. Scott's attempt of pseudo-realistic 'science' suffers from the same symptoms as it did Prometheus: stupidity on all levels.Scott said, The Martian is about people of all kind combining their sources and powers. Well, this is quite pathetic for a bunch of very unoriginal ideas glued together. Maybe Scott recently watched some Star Trek episodes or Apollo 13 (1995) to get 'some' inspirations . . .I guess it's time to avoid Ridley Scott movies from now on."
66," I Will Survive
","Yet another movie that has recently become eerily prophetic anticipating life under lockdown is this long but effective remake of 'Robinson Crusoe on Mars' (1964), with Matt Damon forced to endure seventies disco music in confinement the way Roger Livesey had endured nineteenth century French comic opera in 'The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp'.It faithfully follows both the look and mood of the original, but with the addition of scenes back on Earth creating a ticking clock to generate suspense of the sort only too familiar to anyone who's ever had to instal a feature on their laptop or iPad while being directed by phone. While Shu Chen has been shoehorned into the plot with the Chinese market in mind as a resourceful lady scientist whose last minute inspiration helps save the day."
67," I wasn't overly fussy about it to be honest...
","(Credit IMDb)During a manned mission to Mars, Astronaut Mark Watney is presumed dead after a fierce storm and left behind by his crew. But Watney has survived and finds himself stranded and alone on the hostile planet. With only meager supplies, he must draw upon his ingenuity, wit and spirit to subsist and find a way to signal to Earth that he is alive.The Martian was a major disappointment for me. Mars looks fantastic and everything looks great, but I wasn't able to ever fully get into it like I wanted to. It never felt like Matt Damon was in any true danger to me despite how it was presented otherwise. It tries way too hard to be epic and that's one of the reason it fails. I also felt it lacked suspense. One thing Gravity did well was deliver suspense, but The Martian doesn't. This surprised me a lot because Ridley Scott is a master at suspense. Even though I didn't really go nuts over this movie like a lot of people did, Matt Damon is fantastic. He holds the film together with his excellent performance. I can't really say the same for the rest. Everybody else isn't developed that well. Jessica Chastain is a very capable actress, but she isn't given much to do as I'd hoped. Wiig, Daniels, Bean, Mara, Ejiofor all do fine in the roles they are given. Ejiofor and Mara shine the most out of the people I listedThis movie has its moments, but I was very disappointed overall. It looks great, Damon is superb, but I wasn't in love with it like so many others. Hopefully I'm not alone 6/10"
68," Starving yourself does not work, you just stay well fed
","To my big surprise I liked the Bourne movies with Matt Damon and this is why I went to see this ""Mars""movie with him. (I am not an action movie fan) Am I the only one who gets tired of seeing big stars raking in millions for a movie where they basically behave like they do on every talk show they visit to promote their movies. George Clooney comes to mind too. I have not read the book and after the movie I probably won't. But I understand that there was a lot of danger and suspension in the book, not so in the movie. Damon obviously is too big a star now to go through the trouble and actually loose weight for a role where he is supposed to nearly starve to death. Instead we get a naked, emaciated body of somebody else walking through the room and the well-fed Damon for the rest of the movie after eating minuscule portions for months. Decades ago I loved to see the NASA movies on Imax whenever I visited Houston or Cape Kennedy. None of the movies about space I have seen lately gave me the same sense of awe-inspiring greatness of our universe. I just sit there and ask myself if it is all filmed in a studio or in some desert , or is it all the work of computers? Nothing awe inspiring. Well, I should have learned my lesson by now, if a movie is really pushed by the studio I am always disappointed. Luckily I paid only four bucks to see it."
69," ""Is there life on Mars"" - yes there is
","When I was a 10-year old kid my favourite TV programme was Gerry Anderson's U.F.O. and my favourite EVER episode of that was one called ""Survival"". In it, Colonel Paul Foster (the late Michael 'nearly Bond' Billington) was stranded believed dead on the moon a hundred miles from Moonbase with diminishing oxygen supplies and with the deadly threat of a similarly stranded alien to also deal with. To say it fired my youthful imagination would be an understatement. With Ridley Scott's new film ""The Martian"" we have an almost identical plot, albeit without the alien involvement.Matt Damon plays astronaut Mark Watney who after a freak Martian storm is left for dead by his colleagues in the NASA crew of the ""Hermes"" (led by the excellent Jessica Chastain). By ""sciencing the s**t out of this"" he struggles to survive in the airless and inhospitable landscape. By chance, his presence is detected by NASA and the action switches to the NASA team – principally NASA Director Jeff Daniels, Mars mission director Chiwetel Ejiofor, PR lady Kirsten Wiig, JPL specialist Benedict Wong and ""Hermes"" flight director Sean Bean – and their struggle to save him given the logistical impossibilities involved.I loved this film. In fact, I'll go as far as to say this is my film of the year so far. Matt Damon – never 'Mr Charisma' in most films – is spectacular here, delivering his video logs (which – particularly in 3D – works better than Tom Hanks talking to footballs in ""Castaway"") with a wit and charm that is quite endearing. The supporting cast all bring home the bacon with strong performances, with Ejiofor positively twinkling in the role. The rest of the ""Hermes"" crew, especially Michael Peña and the cute Kate Mara, are also excellent.The screenplay by Drew Goddard (""Lost"", ""World War Z"") and based on the bestselling book by Andy Weir generally works well. A few of the lines, my wife noted, smelled a bit of cheese (some of those from Sean Bean in particular), and there is a largely underdeveloped Chinese side-story (presumably to woo a Chinese audience), but overall the mood of the film carries the script triumphantly forward. (There's a nice nod and a wink to Bean's involvement in Lord of the Rings as well, which made me chuckle).The film also looks marvelous, with the Mars sets and special effects being spectacular, the Mars spacecraft being beautifully realized, and some very impressive long-duration zero-gravity scenes aboard the ""Hermes"" that boggle the mind.In retrospect, the film's success might be deemed to be assured given it is an amalgam of some notable film classics of recent times: the spectacle of ""Interstellar""; the intrigue of ""Moon""; the vacuum-based-perils of ""Gravity""; the hopelessness of ""Castaway"" and the 'world holds its breath' tension of ""Apollo 13"". But after the blockbuster food-mixer stops whirring, the whole thing gels beautifully and despite its fairly long running time (141 minutes) boredom is never close and you leave the theatre buzzing. A key factor in maintaining the tension for the running time is that this is a Ridley Scott film: whilst other directors might insist on a 'Hollywood' ending, with Scott at the helm you can never be sure which way the story might twist in the final reel.(And I'm not letting on here).Unlike last year's ""Gravity"", and the no-doubt accurate but mind-boggling ""Interstellar"", the science all holds up pretty well (although I did have serious reservations about the robustness of polythene sheeting and duct-tape replacing a door at one point).Harry Gregson-Willams' score apes Jerry Goldsmith's ""Alien"" a bit in places, but works well and is massively and joyfully supported by a wide range of disco classics, neatly incorporated into the plot.Go see this film, ideally at the cinema and in 3D: I doubt you will be disappointed. Heaven knows, I don't give away 10 stars very often, but in this case.(If you enjoyed this review please see the graphical version at bob-the-movie-man.com and sign up for future reviews by entering your email)."
70," Saving Private Watney
","The Martian features an a-list cast with acclaimed director Ridley Scott at the helm. Together they bring Andy Weir's best selling novel of the same name to the big screen. Matt Damon plays overly optimistic Mark Watney who unfortunately gets stranded on Mars after a horrific storm leaves him abandoned and presumed dead by his fellow astronauts. As depicted in the trailer, Matt Damon's character is faced with the near impossible predicament of having to survive on Mars with limited food supply while also trying to find a way to contact NASA for a rescue mission. With that in mind one could reasonable expect exciting set pieces with peril at every turn while combining dramatic intensity with clever comic relief. However, The Martian simply failed to live up to these expectations and was mostly a disappointment.Now what exactly made this so disappointing? Firstly, Matt Damon's character failed to bring any seriousness given his situation of inevitable doom. His character seemed so upbeat which did add to the comedic effect of the film but it was just so overdone it took away from the movie being dramatic and intense. Though Matt Damon did a good job portraying his character, the overly gleeful Watney just simply was not the right fit to make this movie dramatic. All of this added up to the film being so unrealistically upbeat that nothing bad seemed likely to happen to Watney's life resulting in the climax of the movie to be unexciting and quite predictable. Also it took away from the empathy one should feel for the character. So if anything unexpected did happen one would not really care about Watney's fate.The Martian failed at trying to skillfully blend comedy with an exciting survival story. Also the movie lacked excitement. There really were no memorable scenes given the film's location and dangerous landscape. The film solely relied on how Watney was going to survive, how he was going to contact earth, and how earth would respond to his situation. Honestly all these events portrayed looked exciting in the trailer but just ended up being tedious and uneventful.Now what exactly did The Martian do right? One of the positives of the movie was its intellect. The intellect behind the writing was arguably one of the best parts of this film which helped redeem it a bit. Also, as expected, the film featured some pretty good special effects. It mimicked the realism of space in a very accurate and practical manner. Unfortunately for The Martian, its special effects were overshadowed by the wondering spectacle of Gravity and the sheer beauty of Interstellar. Lastly, given the talent within the cast, the film was destined for great performances, particularly those of Matt Damon, lead through Ridley Scott's masterful direction.In short, The Martian disappointed through its lack of excitement, intensity, memorable scenes, empathy for the character, and its failed attempt at trying to blend comedy with drama. I would only recommend to scientists, and space nerds who would actually be interested in seeing how someone would survive on a different planet. I would not buy this and it is definitely not a good 3D or IMAX experience. Still waiting for Ridley Scott to make that awesome movie we have not seen in over a decade! 6/10"
71," Not a good movie at all, can;t understand why people like it.
","Okay, I am also perplexed as to why people have given this terrible movie a favorable review. It seems like all we care about is a big name director and big star, then the movie has instant credibility. There was not one truly memorable moment in this movie. I cannot remember a single word, phrase, exchange of dialogue, or turn of event that left a lasting impression. The only positives were Matt Damon's likability and some decent special effects.For one thing how can this premise be taken ass even remotely plausible? Does anyone think that we would send ship to Mars that is vulnerable to a naturally and regularly occurring storm on Mars? And who would design a ship that is docked so perilously? It was standing up like one of those red/white/blue popsicle rocket treats we used to get from the ice cream man as a kid. Or even more than that it looked like a ship from a 1950's era sci-fi movie. C'mon man, this is a new millennium. Make a ship that is supported as it would be supported on Mars. It should be shorter and more stable, not doomed to tip over like shown in the movie. That one scene lost me for the next 30 minutes.Here are the other things I feel left me wanting with that movie. 1. When the storm struck I didn't know who was left behind. I knew it was the Matt Damon character but I didn't ""know"" him, meaning I had no emotional investment in that character. 2. He was a botanist, how convenient. His character didn't have to transform or change in any way in order to survive; he was the perfect guy to be left behind. 3. And just why were the potatoes going to run out??? They said you have 400 and something days, but never said why. Was it because there were other vital nutrients that would be lacking at that point? 4. If you give me 2 years to figure out how to solve a problem that means my survival, and there's nothing else to do but figure it out, I bet I'l find something too. The dates before his food was going to run out were so far out that I never felt a sense of urgency. You can call Mars ""The Monster"" but it wasn't pursuing the main character, just waiting for him to run out of food. How boring is that??? 5. When was the last time we saw nobody but good guys in a movie? There was nobody to blame, no bad guys anywhere. That was just plain weak. A bad guys doesn't have to be a bad person, just a person who either has too much fear or fears the wrong thing, which causes him/her to make poor choices. Nobody served as a villain in any way. I know from playing sports and working in small and large companies that there's always a person who feels like the bad guy, even unintentionally. This movie, with it's little slice of heaven, was absurd to say the least.For these reasons and other minor reasons I was totally disappointed. My wife liked it and I couldn't understand why. This was the dumbest movie I've seen in a long time. I really wanted to like ti but was terribly disappointed."
72," This is bad
","I really looked forward to this movie. High score both on IMDb and rotten, so all lights seem to be green....but the score has to be influenced by the studio as it goes almost every time with 'big' movies last few years. Mediocre or worse movies scoring like masterpieces :-(. Everything positive you read about this movie you can safely wipe from memory. Only two positive points: nice 'spaceshots' and a few moments of good acting from Damon. Too few to make the story believable or to really care about his character. It's what I would call a 100% Hollywood movie. Cliché-filled and therefor to forget asap...but then again that's just me.. you may like it."
73," Total Lack of Emotion and Suspense
","During a storm in Mars, the astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is hit by an antenna and presumed dead by his captain and crew that cannot find him. Captain Melissa Lewis (Jessica Chastain) seeks him out and decides to departure with her crew. However, he has survived and finds that was left behind short of supplies and without communication to Earth. Mark is botanic and uses his knowledge to plant potatoes in a green house he has prepared. Meanwhile in NASA the scientists find that Mark is alive and try at any cost to bring him back to Earth. Will they succeed?""The Martian"" is a film with fantastic special effects and cinematography. However there is a total lack of emotions and suspense and it is hard to understand the hype around this film. Mark Watney seems to be a combination of Robinson Crusoe with MacGyver with his ideas and solutions. However, he never feels depressed or in despair with the loneliness or with his doomed situation. His rescue is a rip-off ""Gravity"" that is better and better. If the viewer watches this movie with great expectation, he or she will be very disappointed. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Perdido em Marte"" (""Lost in Mars"")"
74," Not the same quality Sci-Fi as in 2001 Kubrick and Mr. Clarke...
","Let's see... Had a storm, grew some potatoes, fixed batteries and was saved by incompetent NASA Director and some hip science guys on student loans and Captain/Commander Kirky... I love Science fiction, but this is very poor science fiction and science. It's like what can a botanist with a PHD design? I did like watching the rover vehicle drive around in Arizona, that was kind of a nice feeling. This movie is pure Hollywood and has it's total focus is on a feel good ending. This movie should appeal to someone who enjoys current Hollywood and just likes IMAX scenery and sound and bubblegum endings. I did not like the movie, especially the social overtures. The art of making intelligent movie that reflects how most people live and with some basis in reality is obviously gone."

","SPOILERS*******************Ten reasons why THE MARTIAN didn't work.10. They tried to make it funny. Matt Damon is not funny, except that one time he was a puppet in Team America: World Police. 9. 1990's quality special effects. Couldn't they have hired the effects guy from GRAVITY? Or even watched GRAVITY to see what a space movie looks like in 2015? 8. The main character had no back story. None. Zip. We know nothing about this guy who we are supposed to be rooting on. Except in a random voice over where he said he loved his parents. And that he was the ""best botanist on Mars..."" I actually hoped they would leave stranded so he could glib himself into the next solar system. 7. The device of the voice over was him talking directly into camera a la THE REAL WORLD - again a 1990's device - known from this day forward as ""The Pipe Cam"" where Damon would lay out exposition mixed with a bag full of bad jokes. (My guess is this: these clams were pitched by Damon himself because SEE REASON 10) 6. The supporting cast was dreadfully miscast with special accolades for horribleness to the other astronauts, and (the usually terrific) Jeff Daniels. Daniels must have made this film while doing NEWSROOM and forgot to change characters while walking from one sound stage to another. I'm never going to Michigan if this is what happens to a man. (Chiwetel Ejiofor had the only compelling performance. But that's no surprise) The film's best actor was Damon's ""skinny"" body double who happened to be a foot taller than Damon, but this guy could dry his hair to cover his face until Matt could put his space suit back on like nobody's business. If he hadn't been a 70 year-old John Holmes body double, you never would have guessed it wasn't Damon. 5. The soundtrack was wall-to-wall disco. Yes, disco. Yes, wall-to-wall disco. Which we had finally KILLED by the 90's. 2 hours of disco left behind by the sadistic Commander of the mission. There's even an ABBA song! And I paid $15 dollars to listen to this. The on-the-nose but BEST disco song plays over the closing credits. Not the first disco song where they roll the cast and A.D.'s credits that everyone in LA stays to see. No the second half over the caterers and ""Mr. Damon's assistant"" credits. The song was I WILL SURVIVE by Gloria Gaynor meant not for the fact that Damon survived, but that WE DID SURVIVE this entire film. Damon's character even jokes about the lameness of the disco, but... 4. Matt Damon is NOT funny! So now we're stuck with bad jokes told by an unfunny actor and lots of bad disco. AND I'm sitting next to some old broad whose hearing aid has fallen out of her ear and she doesn't even notice. So Helen Keller here has scammed Medicare for $500 or whatever a Costco hearing aid runs for these days. The aid apparently has a two second delay because I get to hear disco and bad jokes twice. If I had filled my empty popcorn bucket with water, pulled my t-shirt over my face and had my wife dump it on my mouth and nose it wouldn't have been as tortuous as this movie. Not that water-boarding is torture, but you get it... 3. Derivative. Seen it a hundred times: when Damon successfully docks with his returning shipmates (who had abandoned him, ostensibly because he is so damn annoying) the film cuts from one foreign city to another where Times Square type crowds are rooting on the American as they watch the happenings on their own Jumbotron. Russia, France, communist China rooting for America. America. Right. Another example is they lifted an entire scene where Damon operates on himself removing a piece of antennae which is a beat-for-beat rip-off of Javier Bardim removing a bullet from his leg in NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN. Only Damon didn't have to blow up a car outside a drugstore for an opiate because... 2. Damon has his own pharmacy at the space camp. When things look grave he resorts to drug abuse. He breaks open a Vicodin, rubs a potato in it, looks into his Pipe Cam and tells us, ""I ran out of cat sup 3 weeks ago."" It made no sense, so I assumed it was another joke. Because as we all know.... 1. MATT DAMON IS NOT FUNNY."
76," Potatoes on Mars
","This movie was made by the director of Blade Runner and Alien, two works of art, but that was many years ago, back when Mr Scott still had some creativity left. After making this movie Ridley Scott should go into a nursing home and hide. What a piece of crap!! Matt Damon growing potatoes on Mars? Acting? There is no acting! Stay home and watch Blade Runner one more time..:) And the music... Disco all the way!! With David Bowie - Life On Mars? That's when you should close your eyes and get lost in the music, but unfortunately they don't play the entire song! Then there is ABBA, and we all like ABBA... :) NASA is desperately trying to survive and needs a new ""project"" and Mars is it. They always ""forget"" to mention to the general public that the atmosphere of Mars is about 100 times thinner than Earth's, and it is 95 percent carbon dioxide. Is much colder also. The average temperature is about minus 80F. So, if there is water on that planet I would not drink it...:) Going back to the real world...If you like sci-fi I recommend Ex Machina or Luci, if you want to have some fun."
77," Somewhat entertaining
","But wrong in a number of ways. The casting. The disco music. The editing. The Martian is too long, not funny where it tries hard to be funny, and has that ""teenagers rescuing the world"" feel when you look at the other astronauts. I could go on as there is much more. Like the use of duct tape to fix every problem. On the plus side: Matt Damon is okay, the Martian landscape photography looks great, and the story in itself is a good one. But it all does not feel like a Ridley Scott Movie and is just so so. A solid 5 stars."
78," Snoozefest
","Maybe one of the most overrated movies I've ever seen, the plot is so pedestrian and drudges along at an incredibly slow, and predictable, pace.If there's one thing in a movie that can make me lose interest faster than anything else, it is when an uncreative lead casting choice is made, and that actor casted simply plays themselves. It is the most cliched and boring type of movie when this happens, like a paint-by-numbers film experience, and Matt Damon is full blown Matt Damon in this. As a whole, and considering the ridiculous length of the movie, he shows no emotional range at all. It's like watching a Saturday Night Live skit where Matt Damon is just hanging out on a fake space rock, being himself.There are corny, banal, and cliched attempts at humor to really try to make it a commercial hit, but this is stuff that used to be original back in 1990; by now, you've seen and heard it all hundreds if not thousands of times.The only reason I'm even writing this review is because this movie has an 8.0 rating on here, which should mean it is special or elite, and my cable service provider gave it 4/4 stars. Frankly, I would be more entertained watching paint dry than to sit though this boring, predictable, slog of a movie that feels like it was only made for grade-schoolers.5/10 (all five for technical and visual effects)"
79," Please read the book and just forget about the movie.
","This is by far one of the most boring movies of all time thanks to the by-the-numbers screenplay and lazy direction. This Martian does nothing new or interesting; its characters all have traits that don't mean or contribute to anything; its has too much dialogue and the movie forgets about show-don't-tell and that's not even the most offensive thing about the movie. The most offensive thing about the movie is that its a complete injustice to its source material: ""The Martian"" the book is a book that is telling a genuinely interesting tale exemplified by the realistic, grounded science it is based in. This all important aspect of the book is completely lost on the the movie (and its makers). ""Science-ing the s*** out of this"" is only a cathc-phrase to them it instead of being the ever-important philosophy it should embody. Please just read the book and forget about the movie."
80," Hollywood Cheese
","The once great Ridley Scott continues to disappoint in a film for Matt Damon enthusiasts who enjoy crowd-pleasing silly dialogue & gooey, touching moments with accompanying music that helps you know when you're supposed to feel something. Bring him home? Eh...seems like a lot of work & I'm sure in reality NASA wouldn't bother. And neither should you."
81," A corporate drama.
","I'm giving this movie only 1, cause I'm sure that the overall rating isn't an exactly right. It should be somewhere in a range from 5.5 to 6.5 tops.
Again, instead of showing the beauty of Mars, space travels, we see China's help, bureaucracy, music from the 70's and lots of work of the higher ranked managers of NASA (WTF guys?).
The movie has nothing to do with reality. It looks like a fairy tail with a happy ending under a ranch of what is named a space something thing...
I am determined that management of any possible Space Agency has nothing in common with progress in any space program. Only a real scientist can (or capable) understand the real needs of a scientific business (like a journey to Mars). And the corporate culture has no place in that at all."
82," The Most Overrated Movie of the Year
","Imagine if you took the movie Cast Away, stripped away all the humanity and excitement, and set it in space. You'd have The Martian. This movie is an uninspired mess full of dull performances and idiotic characters. Jeff Daniels does a great job at playing the professional idiot, Sean Bean plays the cool dude who undermines his superior, and Matt Damon plays the most annoying protagonist of all time. If you like movies consisting almost entirely of an irritating character talking to you through a webcam about mundane activities or events you've already seen, then buy a ticket immediately. There are literally no redeemable qualities to be found here. The script is laughably bad, the science aspects of the movie don't dazzle the eyes, and there's no tension due to Damon's terrible performance. Just when you think it can't get any worse, the film wraps up with one of the most hilariously terrible climaxes in cinema history. No spoilers, but you'd assume a scientific movie would have a basic understanding of the laws of physics. Anyway, If you like pedantic movies that serve no purpose other than to throw science at your face, without any heart or intrigue, then go see this. Otherwise, I'd advise you look elsewhere. This gets an F."

84," A smart, nearly flawless sci-fi.......
","Science fiction has been one of the genres churned out many times, most turning into capers with few exceptions like Apollo 13 or Gravity. ""The Martian"" isn't a caper nor does it delve into the sentimentality of ""Apollo 13"" or ""Gravity."" It's simply a clever and entertaining sci-fi drama that contemplates the scientific facts meticulously. The story seems more for pleasing the crowd rather than accomplishing a rich literary work; but whatever it does seem flawless and detailed for which the film becomes gripping throughout despite its over length. Based on a novel of the same title, the film pretty enriches your knowledge on astronomy for which it can serve a very good resourcce. Matt Damon in the title role steals the show using much of wit to his role, avoiding sentimentality, and above all, tries something different than the desolation portrayed by Tom Hanks in Cast Away or Leonardo Di Caprio in ""The Revenant."" His role is pretty fun filled and amusing; a memorable performance he has given in recent years after 'The Departed."" A superb narration, brilliant camera work, and a nice performance definitely make it a smart and entertaining movie of the year though the subject and treatment might not feel a regular Oscar worthy material.Rating: 2.5 stars out of 4"
85," Fascinating and enthralling tale of resourcefulness, ingenuity and survival
","Fascinating and enthralling tale of resourcefulness, ingenuity and survival.After a massive storm forces his crew to leave the planet, an astronaut, Mark Watney (played by Matt Damon), is marooned on Mars, and presumed dead. Figuring that it would be at least four years until someone can rescue him, he sets out, though often ingenious means, to survive..A very well thought-out and made movie from director Ridley Scott. Engrossing, engaging plot - the odds are against our hero, and you feel his plight, yet he finds ways to keep going. The resourcefulness stretches beyond a single man though, to the NASA, and other, people on the ground trying to get him home. This engenders a great feeling of a community of specialists working together.While I can't validate the science in the movie (I'll leave that to Neil deGrasse Tyson!), the science FEELS right - there are no obvious plot holes or inaccuracies. Good performances all round, especially from Matt Damon in the lead role. Only sour note is Sean Bean's character, which came across as cartoonish.A must-see."
86," Quite a predictable and boring movie
","First of all sorry for my English. I haven't read the book and my review is based solely on the movie. There are almost no spoilers in this review. Points of criticism: 1) they didn't manage to show the time scale of what's happening so that the viewer can feel it. They show numbers like 500 Sol, but you don't feel that this time has really passed. Interstellar shows the effect of long space travels on people souls and minds way better. 2) the results of some rocket launches were really predictable 3) I have a feeling that China is mentioned there only for commercial reasons. Like you have a market of 1.5 billion people and mentioning China would really attract Chinese viewers to movie theaters. 4) weather is too harsh there on Mars:) 5) (cliché) young genius scientist-sociopath who comes up with a solution of a problem 6) the main character basically overcomes a number of random events as in Gravity. Gravity, however, is more dynamic and makes you feel that there is a danger for the main character. In The Martian, basically, the main character does no mistakes, does not take the risk to achieve anything. His success is limited by some random malfunctions, otherwise he knows more or less everything."

And to make things worse, the ending is almost an exact copy of what they did in ""Red Planet"" (2000), with Val Kilmer...It is a mediocre film made by a director who is showing his age..."
89," Very very ordinary and boring for long stretches
","Someone came up with the idea in Hollywood that the hopeless position of 'Apollo 13' could be crossed with the CGI/techniques of 'Gravity.' And as the story is not true we can really go to town on the jeopardy elements in space as well as on Mars. Hence we have someone left behind on the red planet with little hope of rescue, trying desperately to think of ways of staying alive - Daniel Defoe - does he still get royalties for rip offs of 'Robinson Crusoe?' For most of the time it all seems comparatively easy, and you do not believe for one minute that we are anywhere but in the desert on Earth, even Wadi Rum from 'Lawrence of Arabia.' Atmosphere is the same!!!! Work is just a matter of humping a few things, and trouble can all be fixed with white tape!!!! The middle of this film is awfully boring and totally uninteresting - drama having to be provided by painful expressions of disbelief and horror at the predicament of Matt Damon (the stranded astronaut) by Edifor and Wiig that does not really convince. Action in the last third is pure Hollywood - let's space walk without a safety rope, and we can cut our spacesuit to use pas propulsion! For most of the film you are looking and feeling with Matt Damon (not a lot as he is given little to work on), but just in case you did not get his predicament, there is a totally redundant speech by him on what he faced as the final scene! But worst of all, there is a hole in the plot so large it undermines the rickety edifice of a superficial movie completely. They leave Matt Damon because of a storm on Mars which threatens to topple the MAV (escape rocket back to orbit), and it would have done if they had not left. Guess how Matt Damon escapes the red planet? Another MAV has been sent early for a later mission and is sitting upright untouched some thousands of kilometres across the surface! Oh, really, come on Mr Scott and Hollywood that is cheating your audience. Acting is basic and perfunctory. Direction just a red shaded desert scene with endless vistas. Script needed heavy doctoring - forget the jokes, they are mere pleasantries! Overall another over-hyped film that is pretty empty and ordinary."
90," McGyver-Cruso on Mars
","OK  so much has been written both good & not so good about this film here and at other movie review sites. Considering myself a seasoned sci-fi fan, maybe it's just my advancing years but, Ridley Scott and company, what were you thinking? When is somebody going to give Mars a truly grandiose sci-fi treatment? How would Kubrick have handled this subject? So much of the suspense and pacing of the book is totally missing from this movie. Even at over two hours the events of the film just doesn't connote the passage of months. Further, it all seems just a little too glib. Our hero doesn't ever seem to be in any peril at all as long as he can ""science the sheet out of this"" he'll get by just fine. Red Green fans will love the somewhat comic use of NASA's super duct tape too. Even if you haven't read the book, in this typically ""Hollywood"" film, we know right from the first frame that our wisecracking group of explorers will never be in any real jeopardy. Even the premise of the entire movie is totally false. Wind speeds on Mars can be high but the atmosphere is so tenuous that it exerts a negligible force. The sand storm depiction is just plain wrong. Yes I know - suspension of belief - even Andrew Weir makes this concession in You Tube presentation. It's yet another totally forgettable sci-fi film about Mars. Chris in Winnipeg Canada, Oct 2015."
91," Too damn predictable nonsense!
","Well, firstly, Ridley ticked all the boxes in what the audience expects to see, even if it is a sci-fi genre movie. Then, where is the devastation of the devastating news that matt damon received?Then all the corny jokes? and the unnecessary swearing meant to resemble the directors' POV.The racial discrimination that is made obvious in the films effort not to make it obvious.The predictable yeah scenes. Im so surprised there was no alien busting out of Matt Damon's chest!Ridley you are ridiculous and you made me under appreciate Matt Damon's acting.This truly was a pathetic movie. Just ask any black man with a Kapoor Family name! What a waste of time, but Im not surprised it was a hit, as the target audience you sought appreciated it. ""clap clap clap""."
92," A long movie with little suspense
","This movie is rated highly on IMDb and features Matt Damon in space, so I thought it would be worth a watch. Unfortunately, it wasn't very good. The main problem is that you only rarely feel that the main character is in any real danger. He is pretty upbeat about the whole thing and keeps making trite comments/jokes, such as ""I'm gonna have to science the sh*t out of this"". And when there finally is some crisis, he fixes it very quickly and the suspense is killed again. The use of disco music also adds to the silly atmosphere in the movie.Maybe I'm not supposed to compare this movie with Gravity and Interstellar, but those two movies are vastly superior in my opinion. They both deliver experiences that makes you hold your breath and feel the danger and harshness of space and foreign planets, whereas The Martian just feels long and boring.The acting and CGI is fine, for the most part."
93," A sci-fi not only for sci-fi fans
","The Martian is one of my most favourite films. It is a Ridley Scott's action sci-fi film which is based on the book by writer Andy Weir. Matt Damon stars as an astronaut Mark Watney - ""the Martian"".
The plot starts at the end of the research mission on Mars. NASA astronaut, a botanist and mechanical engineer Mark Watney went missing in a dust storm during a mission on Mars. The rest of his crew left the planet, thinking he is dead. But Watney survived and he must find the way how to survive alone on the foreign planet and how to send signal to the Earth to say that he's alive.
Although the film is quite slow-paced and there are not many action scenes, it is still immersive. That's because the place of the film set as well as the special effects are outstanding and make the film realistic and credible. The soundtrack is also good, the music can be heard almost during whole film because there are not many dialogues.
In my opinion, this film is really gripping and spectacular. Every aspect of the film is really good. However, I found Matt Damon's performance the best thing about the film. Overall, it is a really enjoyable film."

97," Alone in space ..scary thing
",Too late ..honest to watch this movie ..but it just entertaining and tense ..good job with actor matt damonn ..
98," One of Ridley Scott's best!
","To summarise THE MARTIAN in a sentence, I consider it to be the quintessential N.A.S.A movie. It's a film about space, about the science and logistics behind space travel, how the media responds to off-world emergencies and finally, of course, Mars. Despite what the name may entail, this film is not about little green men brandishing ray guns that get their kicks by sucking out our brain stems and blowing up rural farms - this is a film about man's will to survive by outsmarting the odds he has been handed.
Performed brilliantly by Matt Damon, astronaut Mark Watney is left stranded on Mars by himself after an accident forces his crew off the planet, believing him to be dead. This film is set in the far future, and apparently in a time period where travel to and from Mars is possible, yet time-consuming. What could very easily be a film about a man twiddling his thumbs on a dust-ball planet speaking into a video diary is in fact a very excellent sci-fi adventure that I think anybody who appreciates well-crafted cinema can enjoy. The film, while filled with science-y mumbo-jumbo, is a lot more exciting than that may make it sound. I thoroughly believe THE MARTIAN will be hailed as a modern-day classic in ten or fifteen years, and we'll be showing it to our kids. It is family-friendly (with perhaps very little cussing), intense in one scene but happy and funny in the next, and you'll be with Watney in his million-mile isolation all the way. You truly want to see how (and if) he can escape Mars before he succumbs to starvation, a lack of oxygen, or even his own mind.
Jeff Daniels also lends a decent performance as N.A.S.A's director, pressured by the media's incessant interrogations and the financial/moral burden of choosing to either save a single man, or just forget about him. To top it all off, the visual presentation is stunning here, and you could really believe they shot it on location on Mars! Or, ahem... a really big desert on Earth.
This is based off of Andy Weir's 2011 novel of the same name, which I still have to read; but I am tempted to believe this is a faithful adaptation due to its critical success. And who should direct a brilliant sci-fi movie like this except for the man who gave us eternal classics like ALIEN and BLADE RUNNER? Ridley Scott, despite being as old as God these days, still has a cutting-edge professionalism about him, and you could believe the movie was put together by a young guy if you didn't know who Scott was.
I am very grateful to have seen this movie in the cinema back in 2015, when everyone was talking about it, but it isn't too late for you to check this movie out yourself now. So go slip on your astronaut gear, depressurise your room, and bring him home!"
99," Great movie
","Great movie, like to think as realistic as it can be. I love performance by Matt Damon, Chiwetal Ejiofor, Jeff's Daniels and Jessica Chastain."
100," Who Doesn't Like This Movie?
","The Martian is a clever, sophisticated movie, designed for the viewer who knows how to read!
This is NOT a baddies v goodies melodrama.Realistic science incorporated into a desperate plea for a man to get back home, using his brain.Its quality story telling that latches you to our protagonist as he moves back and forth between success and failure.Will he find a way home?A must watch!"
101," Science got right.
","As a science and movie geek, this was a gold mine.The movie starts with a bang, doesn't waste that many minutes and goes to full thriller mode. Even the 'medical' scene of him taking out the rod was well acted and intense. Got so many goosebumps when Matt's first discovery was found by NASA.The concept of Cast Away meets Apollo 13 is great. Props to the original writer and adapters to faithfully keeping most of it.Cinematography was great, made boring desert Mars look stunning, praises for the direction by Ridley Scott has nothing to add more for his rich career.I thought it was only ganna be Matt Damon but boy was I wrong. Movie nerd inside me brust open when I saw that humangase of a cast.Jessica Chestain,Kate Mara, Sebastian Stan(Bucky) and Micheal Pena(Luizzz) in the main crew. The relationship set up between the crew was well executed without that much scenes, build up, at the start.Chiwetel Ejiofor is fantastic, his protrayal of helpful and caring person was phenomenally done. Jeff Daniels as NASA Director stole some scenes for me at the start with his rude caricature. Wong and Donald Glover had short but very effective scene time. Sean Bean not dying has no scientific explanation.All the NASA scenes, Mars scenes, JPL, China & Hermes working together felt great. Everybody uniting to save a human life.The movie had great sprinkles of comedy. Protagonist humourous approach to every trouble and optimistic characterisation served the themes of 'not giving up' pretty well. Looking for best in the worst of things. Hence he came back alive, cuz science.Now the sciennccce, 'The greatest botanist in this planet', 'Botany isn't science.' Using radioactive decay to solve cooling problem, using own waste as fertilizers was fantastic, making H2O from N2H2 and blowing himself up for miscalculation got the science right. Even astronomical science, rocket science had some realism in them. Blowing up Hermes and poking space suit for thrust as Iron Man, superb. Mars is the name of Roman God of War, and his Greek version is called 'Ares', hence the name Ares3 4 for Mars mission. And Hermes is the Greek god of travel (also Mercury but travel seems more right)Scientists are not always crazy old dudes in white coats, they work together and solve problems. One of the few movies that got both science and scientists right."
102," Average Ridley Scott.
","This is about par for Ridley Scott. Was expecting more visual stuff, but still a good watch."
103," Amazing
","Very good movie. Terrific graphic scenes of Mars, as far as I known true to real Martian geography and landform. But I get very sick of watching Matt Damon eating and drinking, and what I take as a boastful attitude: ""I am selfish enough to want all the credit"" he says near the end. Usually I like him a lot, but in this one, I find him irritating, despite his very good acting. I wish he chewed less, and swore less.
Everything that happens is a ""long shot"", but with enough setbacks thrown in to make it realistic. Astronomy is amazing. By the way, many many discoveries Nasa have made about the planets and moons in our solar system suggest strongly that the solar system is relatively young, way less than the oft quoted 4.5 billion years. I hope we can get there one day and check these things out....Go Spacex!"
104," It's not easy to find a sci-fi film that doesn't shed blood and is not sensational these years.
","On science fiction, Ridley Scott is much better than Nolan. Under the surface of comedy is actually an extraordinarily orthodox way of hard science fiction. It's great not to have a messy emotional line to win over the host. My favorite place is that I didn't emphasize the obsession with the earth at all in the process of survival, and the climax didn't even come back to the earth, because it didn't matter at all!"
105," The story of hope...
","The story in brief:The man called Mark Watney from NASA's space mission gets left behind on Mars alone as a result of a tragic incident and his teammates believe that he is dead. Mark realizes that he has somehow survived through this accident & decides to survive for some more days. This hope of surviving pushes him to all his limits & come up with insane solutions, which no one would ever imagine.What this movie taught me:Even after realizing that his team has left him alone on Mars, he never blames any of his teammates
->How often we do this? We keep on blaming others for our own situationsHe uses his knowledge as a botanist to the true potential & grows potatoes on the soil of Mars with his own poop
->Did we ever think about our true potential?Once everything was set up & going as per his plan, his small experiment blows all his crops & he is back to zero again. But this doesn't stop him.
->Ups & downs are part of life, they shouldn't shake you up. The right attitude will always get you out of any troubleHe would record himself every single day with a hope that when he dies, someone would listen to his story of surviving on Mars
->Live your life as if you are writing a book, which others would love to read later onHe kept that smile on his face till the very last moment in space, when his team actually rescues him
->Appreciate & acknowledge what life has given you irrespective of your current state or what you aspire to beMy favorite line from the movie: Tell my family, that I never stopped fighting to make it home"

","Pros:
1. The costume and set design are are incredible and intricately designed.
2. The futuristic score and Disco soundtrack does a great job at suiting the space setting, as well as helping the film a lift when needed.
3. Matt Damon (Mark Watney) gives a fantastic performance.
4. The comedy is inserted well, and does an amazing job at preventing the movie from becoming too dark.
5. The cinematography is really eye-catching, especially the stunning and breathtaking shots of Mars.
6. All of the characters make intelligent and deep character decisions, which makes every decision hit harder, in addition to fully empathising with the characters and their ordeal.
7. When Mark Watney is finally reunited with Melissa Lewis (Jessica Chastain), it is a genuinely emotional scene.Cons:
1. There is some dodgy shaky cam in the beginning.
2. There are a couple plot-holes. For example, If NASA hates fire (including items that can contribute to fire), how come they let Rick Martinez (Michael Peña) bring a wooden crucifix to Mars? Surely they would check personal items taken by the astronauts? Another example would be the Chinese choosing to sacrifice their technology secrets to save an American astronaut; they would never do this in the real world.
3. The movie doesn't focus enough on the psychological impacts that being left alone, with very little hope of escape, on a strange planet would do to a person.
4. When narrating messages, the film bizarrely has the receiver and the sender both read out the message. You only need one.
5. Some of the characters are given very little, if anything, to do. This includes both Mitch Henderson (Sean Bean) and Annie Montrose (Kristen Wiig)."

","If a movie wants to impress the audience,it doesn't have to be sensational. We can't find any traces of sensation in The Martian,but it really moved the audience because of the feelings of the actor Mark His tenacity and optimism,his unyielding beliefs,are all an essential part of real life."
108," The movie should be counted as a comedy (or dramedy) or it isn't very good.
","I love this film. I love its optimism. I love its romantic view of how science-untouched and uninterested in politics!-works. I love that the film thinks people would be interested in space travel. I love the film's technical aspects creating a believable series of engineering feats that even look good to the eye. But I love the film as a light piece of scientific romance. It is not an intense exploration of the issues. It is not a drama.The film sort of infamously won the best picture-comedy at the Golden Globes. I saw it after that happened and I was really surprised anyone had the problem with the classification. The film is extremely funny. It has running gags. It has puns. It has multiply asides that are only in the film because they are funny. Most of the actors have comedic backgrounds. But most of all the central plot largely exists to hang wonderment and scientific romance on.Watney's death was only ever theoretical in the film. It was never a real possibility. The film repeatedly undermines the central tension with jokes. I think the film does this to focus the viewer on the engineering/science issues. The plot is faintly a little absurd in how the developments happen. Watney experiences all manners of set backs but, critically, they never ever seem more than he can handle; they are solved in fun ways. There's even a duck tape joke. This is a wonderful structure for a movie having fun with the engineering and the speculation of how a mars mission would work. Even in the film's darkest moments are tempered with optimism. Even as Watney fears his death and he is still at peace with it because he loves what he does. This tone works and the film is lovely as a result. But if you say the film is a drama it is too detached from Watney's possible death to work. The tension is never on if Watney will survive. It is on *how* Watney will survive and that makes it a scientific romance, not a drama.Damon is wonderful in this film. Indeed this is such a well put together and everything works so well that it is a personal favorite of mine."
109," Not a science fiction connoisseur but good
",One of the better science fiction movies in the last 20 years. Good writing and editing
110," Pretty boring
","Probably the most overrated movie of 2015. If you want to watch a similar movie about a person stuck in space go watch 'Moon' from 2009. The visuals are as good and the story is 10 times better, even acting. I'm not saying Ridley Scott is a bad director and Matt Damon a bad actor, the story here is just not that interesting, that's all."
111," Okay
","I lost interest in the movie after a while. It was fun in the beginning. The man in space learning to live for himself. Not expecting help. It had good reviews too. It just couldn't hold up for me. Not because of Damon, just because of the film.6 stars"
112," I expected something more tense then this.
","Whats with this world? Something is really overated and something is underrated. Underated like Terminator Salvation,Event Horizon and similar sci-fi, but this , 8.0 i mean what!?
This movie had good start , but after he lost his crew and he was solo accidentally on this planet i expected he is going to loose insanity now and start having hallucinations. I mean u are relaxed alone in planet and u are all doing fine throughout entire years without loosing your mind... They better had this tense mind blow stuff throughout this movie and weird hallucinations because you getting crazy by being solo, then soft movie like this one. IDK i was really bored watching. I really like Matt Damon and his movies but this one nah. Even his movie Elysium i found better and underated then this one."
113," The death or resolution.
","The most important thing is the knowledge itself, but the wisedom for working it.
Watney starring by Matt Damon was left alone in Mars. That sounds serious, but actually it was not. It reminds me the old TV program. In that, a comedian lived alone only by the lottery. It was similar to this.A few days ago, I asked my coworker if she has watched it already. But her reply was so funny! She asked me, 'It's a story about the growing potetos, isn't it?' I was so surprised!! As she got it like that, actually it's a positive survival."
114," Fun sci-fi thing
","This is a pretty good movie. Everything looks great, and Matt Damon gives a good performance. The parts where he tried to grow food, and when they were planning the rescue, were quite interesting. The climax was a little lackluster, as all their crazy plans end up working just as expected. I didn't find it very tense, and it lacked any of the social commentary that great sci-fi films usually have. Entertaining and well executed, but not particularly deep or ground-breaking."
115," Watchable
","The movie's storyline and the whole plot was pretty interesting and makes you wonder how courageous our astronauts are without whome these extraordinary research wouldn't have been possible.The whole Mars scene felt intense but overall the movie didn't feel extraordinary, it was average. The makes tried to make the movie dramatic and serious which didn't gel much with the funny attitude our lead character had according to me.I think the movie is watchable but you don't really miss anything if you let it pass."
116," Stayin' Alive
","As soon as I saw Jeff Daniels I realised this picture was going to be Dumb And Dumber than I was initially hoping; most of us live in hope. But at least he makes sense paired with Sean Bean. Serious scientist Matt Damon in a life and death situation relishing using naughty adult words doesn't help. I hadn't seen Robinson Crusoe On Mars for decades either and to see him brought up to digital date was the next best thing – although continually and sometimes hopelessly incongruous 70's disco music kept taking me back to the ye olden primitive days when NASA actually had some of their employees cavorting about on the Moon.Damon is left for dead on Mars after a big storm and disaster and has to survive and fend for himself until death or rescue. It's all extremely well done, with the usual seemingly minute attention to detail looked after, and is sufficiently gripping and entertaining. All of us millions of news-hungry space fans cheer Bravo! from Times Square, Red Square and Trafalgar Square for CNN to cover this opinion as Breaking News. And great that the making of the film gave 15,000 people jobs and purpose (the end credits seemed to be much more populous), and I only wish there could be many sequels to keep them all employed. But now to delete it.Unlike Damon I'm not going to have to science the poo out of this but – I would rather recommend the equally corny, escapist and similar film but with more honest human characterisation and emotion Mission To Mars instead. And Jeff Daniels wasn't in it either."
117," The Martian: The Parade of banal and mediocre movie clichés
","First half of the movie was good. A breath of fresh air exploring a theme of a man surviving on his own - a feeling that is kinda forgotten for civilized people. ...But then starts series of the most boring and stupid clichés Hollywood spawned. They take about 1.5 hr of the total 2.5.It's not just ""ok nothing new here"", it's about ""ok, how can we make this movie even more mediocre?"".Cliché about people people in command center celebrating every successful thing? You got it!Cliché about crowd on the streets celebrating a space flight (what they actually never do)? Here you go!Really, they failed miserably with such a great theme, such a shame.If not the first hour I'd voted 2 with no doubt."
118," Whatever happened to good space movies?
","Underwhelming and boring movie, can't understand how it gets so much acclaim and good reviews in general. The theme of man overcoming challenges through ""science"" sprinkled with disco music here and there to awaken viewers along the way and raise their spirits felt cliché and didn't make it for me. The film just felt somewhat void and foreseeable. I think it lacked suspense and if I may ""planetary or space awesomeness"", but of course that is not the mood the film aims at, so you can blame me for judging it from my expectations rather than than considering the movie in itself. However, to me it seems almost like a movie about Mars had to be made and this is what we got.You would expect something special coming from Ridley Scott, or maybe not after the disappointment of Prometheus (for me that film deflated at about the equator and contained some odd script and dialogue nonsense) What happened to old good space movies?"
119," Martian: 0 - Earth: 0. Tie game, yawn
","I went to this movie because I am interested in how NASA, and maybe other space travel enthusiasts may see the future for us in space. I also wanted to see Ridley Scott come away with a real winner.I came away very disappointed.There was not enough science in the developing of this story...just a lot of space needing to be filled. I didn't care to see alien conflicts. I didn't care to see mega weaponry. Sure there was some clever resourcefulness but not worthy of a 2 hour movie. While I am not a big fan of Mark Watney's creativity(he was a knowledgeable scientist doing what scientists do), he was more creative than the creators of this movie.Seriously, this movie was like going to work and dealing with everyday problems. What's the big deal? I cannot condemn the acting but I do condemn the material the actors had to deal with. And for two hours??? If the creators had shown more interest in the content I would have been more interested myself."
120," Damon was great. The rest of the cast...meh!!
","I was not impressed with The Martian especially since Ridley Scott directed it. Matt Damon was excellent but I was not impressed with the rest of the cast. Jeff Daniels seemed like he walked off the set of The Newsroom and stayed in his Will McAvoy character. Jessica Chastain as the captain of the ship was beyond belief as well as Kate Mara as one of the crew members. Kirsten Wiig was also very distracting and ill cast. When making serious decisions, they were too busy smiling and joking around. No way anyone on a 500 day journey would act like this. I guess I was expecting a darker, more foreboding tone to the movie. I never felt that there was any real suspense that a signature Scott movie is known for. I gave it 6 out of 10 stars to be nice. I wouldn't watch it again."
121," The 4 stars are for the visuals
","I'm a space junkie. I follow the latest news and developments from the Mars Rovers. I follow Voyager I and II on twitter. I also loved the movie Interstellar. In Interstellar, I felt like the science, although unbelievable, was actually believable from a scientific theory perspective. Interstellar was great science. In addition to that great science, was an excellent and heart grabbing storyline and screenplay. And this inter play between heart grabbing story and good science that made Interstellar so powerful, is what the Martian lacked and for a movie focused on one guy, it was sorely needed. Let me first say that the visuals of mars, outerspace, the inside of the spaceship Hermes in The Martian were amazing. It was truly interesting to see on film what our current understanding says the surface of Mars looks like. The sky looked almost earth like and the terrain was very Arizona desert like. It was cool to watch and think about what it would feel like if you were on Mars. Aesthetically beautiful film. Now, for the rest of the movie... I could not relate to Matt Damon's character, Mark Watney. Not in the sense that I needed he and I to have a similar background, etc. But in the sense that I didn't see any real human element to Watney. He came off as robotic in his attitude. I get it that he wanted to be upbeat but c'mon Ridley Scott, the guy is alone with his thoughts 24 hours a day for hundreds upon hundreds of days and we can't get a flashback of him thinking about loved ones he left behind on earth, or of him showing mental agony, stress, and sadness.... Just something to let us know that this guy isn't some type of A.I. There is one quick, seemingly thrown in, scene 2 hours into the film where Watney makes a quick mention of some family back on Earth. Other than that, he seems to be a guy who has no loved ones, nobody that personally knows and cares about him except the crew he went to space with. Nor does he seem to have any true feelings for anybody that we know of. He's just a guy who constantly makes sarcastic remarks and acts as if he is starring in a reality show, not someone who is stranded 50 million miles away from Earth alone with his thoughts. If you've seen the trailer, you've seen the film. There are no surprises. No real suspense except at the very beginning and at the end and even then you knew what was going to happen. This movie won't make you feel really happy or sad. It won't make you wonder what happens next nor will you really care. It's basically just a documentary about how to survive on Mars if you're an astronaut and your crew leaves you behind. The end.4 out of 10."
122," Not very entertaining, and not very exciting
","I'm an engineer, so I enjoy science in my science fiction. But more than that, I most enjoy a science fiction movie that's exciting and entertaining. ""The Martian"" is mostly neither. ""The Martian"" must have been sold to investors as ""Robinson Crusoe on Mars"" meets ""Gravity"". Ultimately, though, it is not as entertaining as either of those movies, and here's why.What I really like about ""Gravity"" is that they took an otherwise rather slow-moving and potentially boring space story and turned it into a roller coaster ride. I thought the movie had good pacing and good effects. The film excelled -- was perhaps groundbreaking -- in its look and feel of being in space.""The Martian"" presents itself as science that could really happen, almost a documentary of this guy's life on Mars. But the story is full of holes -- see many other reviewer comments -- just as ""Gravity"" is -- many pointed these out as well. ""Robinson Crusoe on Mars"" (1964) is a silly tale, with not much scientific accuracy, yet I found it (still do) to be entertaining -- even endearing.""The Martian"" comes off as full of itself. Everything is so melodramatic. The writers feel they have to throw dialogue at us to make us understand just how amazing something is that is about to happen or already happened. I do think Matt Damon is a fine actor and does a good job with his role. It's just that the writers and director chose the easy route of letting their actor's ability and the Mars special effects sell the movie. They made an okay movie, but not a very entertaining or great movie.If it were me, I wouldn't nominate the director or writers for this one. I've always had a fascination with Mars, so for me it was enough just to see the fantastic landscapes revealed in the movie through some nice special effects. Wish there had been more of that and less gratuitous dialogue."
123," Borefest
","I had high hopes for this movie based on the trailer and adverts that I had seen but my god was I wrong. The movie was utterly boring. it is a cliché these days to say 'there was so much potential' and yes there was but there was not much to salvage. The casting was bad, Matt Damon has made a few decent movies but he is no Christian bale, he has very little variance in his character, i mean being stuck out there on another planet you would expect someone to be freaking out,but instead happy clappy Damon is saying he is going to 'science it'. Yeh i suppose if you are into science and the physics behind it you would be somewhat entertained. But from a cinematic point of view there was very little to be entertained by. Very little CGI , very little character development . It came off more as a B movie that you would be aired on TV."
124," Extremely Disappointing
",Not very often I feel I need to write a review but I just want to put it out there that this was extremely disappointing and one of the most painfully boring films I've seen in a long time.I absolutely loved the film Gravity but this did nothing for me.Where was the beauty. Where was the build up?Why was Matt Damon's character so annoying?Why was there so much cheesy stuff in this film.Real waste of time and money for us.Apologies I know it sounds negative but it's been a long time since I've been so disappointed
125," Leave him there
","Are you kidding me? It's what Matt Damon / Mark Watney asks at a certain point in the movie about NASA's plans to bring him home and it was basically the only moment when me and Watney felt empathythough commenting entirely different matters. I have not read the book, if it's a blatant John Wayne sci-fi take on the ""throw me anything, I am an American cowboy and will laugh in the face of death, finding a brilliant solution to survive"" concept, then brilliant, Ridley Scott totally nailed it. Otherwise the story and dialogs are among the poorest things I have seen lately. It just looks like a NASA-on-steroids advertising striving to convince that ""we can solve anything you throw at us and we'll also be funny and classy doing it"". There are so many positive reviews about this movie here in IMDb and it frightens me. I get it, the movie is visually quite great (but NOTHING in comparison to something like Interstellar, which stands not just higher, but totally on another level), and for sci-fi, space travel nerds like me it's always amazing to see spaceships, spacesuits and realistic attempts to visualize it. But why should the story be so dull?? It makes you think about Ridley Scott with a super size me cigar in his mouth sitting on a human leather couch in a gazillion million dollar house in Hollywood chatting with a bunch of producers saying ""ok, we'll set a bunch of explosions, and the guy will laugh about it and say something funny, then we'll, like, make everything go south, super-south, and he'll find solutions for everything, then we'll throw in the Chinese that help us Americans but we do it better anyway in the end, oh, and let's stick in a young nerdy physicists that nails the perfect solution that not even a Nobel prize would come up with!"". There are way too many clichés in this movie and nothing is innovative left aside the wonderful spacesuits."
126," sterile and airless as Mars
","The more I watched this film, the more irritated I became.First, there was the under-scoring, constantly nudging me, telling me what to feel: ""Oh, look, this is cute; this is dangerous; wait, suspense coming up; how jolly; oh, isn't that cool?"" etc., etc. There were only a few moments when I was left alone with the images and characters.Then, there was Disco. The reason Disco music came and went so fast is that it's emotional range is so narrow. You'd think that with all of Music to plunder, the producers could have found something more expressive: jazz, swing, classical, hey, even folk would have given us more depth and range. But this is just another sign that this movie operates within very limited bounds..It's so obvious it was written by a nerd: ""Hey, how cool would it be to take all the problems that might come up in extra-terrestrial exploration and show in tedious detail how good I can be in solving them?""The trouble is, that the people doing the solving are all, without exception, inhuman automatons.Matt Damon at least has an advantage in that it can crack a few feeble jokes. All the rest, back on Earth and on the space craft, despite the p.c.-athon of all the sexes and races and ages and nationalities, come down to a single type of artificial intelligence: the ability to solve problems. Completely incapable of any emotion whatsoever: no tears, no laughter. All brain and no heart.I started to feel very uneasy when the crew debated whether to turn around and rescue Damon. Any sign of reluctance? Of conflict? Any feeling at all? Nope; not a peep. Oh, yes, we'd be happy to ""solve this problem."" Evidently, the thought of spending another 2 years in space requires no pondering, no soul- searching; in other words, no sacrifice. And why would it? These are not humans, they are robots.Oh, sure, we get a shot of the leader making a slight ""moue"" of regret, when she learns that Damon is alive after she left him to die. But does she lose any sleep, any self doubt? Not a bit; it's on to the next ""solution.""(Maybe she should open a business and call it ""Rescue Solutions."")I felt emotionally boxed in again when Damon was reunited with his crew. Was there any questioning of motives, signs of team rivalry or sexual tensions? No,no recriminations, no resentment. Instead, it was all about superficial joy at having ""solved"" the problem. And why not; he was never in any real danger, was he? Because he was not really human.Maybe this is film is for those who like detective stories, solving mysteries and reading riddles.But, for me, there is nothing of the wonder and mystery of life, nothing of that riddling essence we call humanity."
127," Amazing
","This is a science fiction movie. The main character is Mark who is a astronaut. In order to investigate Mars, all members of the crew including Mark go to Mars. One day, sandstorm is happened. All members of the crew go back to the earth because everyone thinks that he is dead. However, he is alive. So, he takes advantage of having all knowledge to live and go back. He is a very tough whatever happens, so that I am very impressed with his way of life. So, please watch this movie."
128," Overrated and over-hyped
","If you're the type of person who needs all the details to be plausible, this isn't the movie for you. It fails quite remarkably in that respect. The acting is unconvincing from all the main performers and eye-rollingly poor from Matt Damon. The script is maddening at how dumb it often is. Everything is explained to you like you're an idiot, and even to the NASA officials like they're all interns, rather than rocket scientists who know their stuff. There's a shameless amount of movie-computer sound affects. There are several characters in this movie that are pointless, like Kristen Wiig, who is always trying to keep a straight face through her unnecessary lines. It is almost devoid of tension because problems are solved within seconds of being encountered, often to a blaring disco soundtrack. About 40 minutes in I began to lose interest and wanted to check the reviews of this movie to see if I was the only one disappointed. In the end, you feel like you spend more time watching this movie than Matt Damon spends marooned on Mars. Some compare this to Castaway, Gravity and Apollo 13. But it seems more like the baby of Community, Big Bang Theory and Guardians of the Galaxy."
129," Typical Overrated ClaptrapFamiliar, Forced, and Forgettable
","Artificial, Derivative, and unwelcome Things like Forced and Unfunny one liners and...Wait for it.........A lot of Disco Muzak...while constantly Reminding the Audience just how Bad Disco Muzak is.The Film has very Little Style and the Shining, pristine Sets Look OK, but begin to Bore after a while. The Space Shots and the Mars Landscape, Ditto. The Acting is Stiff, and the PC inclusions are Distracting.All of the Action set Pieces, what Few there are, have been Seen in other Sci-Fi Films. The ""Coming Together"" of Earth's Population with Clichéd ""Time Square"" shots from Around the World have been Done to Death in the Genre, ""War of the World's"" (1953) and ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" (1951), to Name a couple.In Fact, almost Everything in the Story has been Done before and the Film just Can't Escape it's Familiar Territory with anything New, Exciting, or Inventive. It really is a Big Disappointment and will only Seem Fresh to Young Folks and People that Don't Watch a lot of Movies.Overall, Average at Best, but Cookie-Cutter to the Extreme, Flat, Uninventive, and some severe Missteps (Disco and Stand Up Routines), Render this just Another Big Budget, quickly Forgotten, A-Picture trying to bring its B-Movie Pedigree to New Heights. Truth be Told, the B-Movies do it Better."
130," Mars commercial?
","As a real Ridley Scott fan, I hate to say this, but the director has lost his spark and talent in recent years. In other words, do you remember ""A Ridley Scott movie"". You can't feel this anymore which is sad for fans like me. The Martian is another disappointment, so if you don't know about the fact that this film was shot by Scott before watching the film, you cannot understand until the end credits. As for the problem of the movie, the movie is not ""Cast Away on space"". I wish it was, but it is not. Why? Because there is no suspense, no mystery and no horror. The film ignores the psychological nature of the character and he doesn't face with any real challenge or trouble. Do you remember? When After Earth was released, it was mostly criticized for not being ""too dangerous"". The Martian is much worse. You cannot feel the danger, so does character! Because there is no real danger in the film. The main character behaves like John McClane at times, but he is not John McClane though. I mean a witty John McClane perfectly fits Die Hard franchise, but here it doesn't work. Most of the time, our man alone is ""happy"". And this ""happy"" mood defines the tone of the film. I would even prefer Red Planet over The Martian, because despite Red Planet was just a passable popcorn flick, it was mysterious, dark, suspenseful and interesting. The story in The Martian is not interesting, because it is not a survival type of a movie! I am a Matt Damon fan, I can watch him peeling potatoes and onion for hours, I am such a fan, but even he was dull here. The Martian is also a talky film, in fact too much talky, but the story needs more visuals than chatting, in other words more silence than words. 3D was just fine except for a few dazzling Mars images. The film reminded me the masterpiece Silent Running and I wish it would have been as great as that movie. The final chapter of the movie becomes lazy, dull and cliché unfortunately and it cannot add something fresh to the story. And do I have to say the film lacks emotion and real entertainment which is weird. Additionally, some supporting characters were supposed to be funny, but actually they are not. I can prefer even Prometheus over The Martian honestly."
131," poor representation of the novel
","The amount of detail left out of the movie is jarring, nothing is explained - rather they gloss over everything with 'the math checks out.' Major set-backs of Watney's are also left out, and not to mention they changed the ending to a more 'Hollywood' one. The character development was atrocious - never going into any detail other than their position and title.Matt Damon should not have been casted as Watney as well, the joking and serious side shown in the novel didn't feel authentic in his performance. Any actor in Hollywood would have accepted this role, and Damon was the first choice? Weird.The CGI was disappointing as well, when floating in 0G they changed direction out of nowhere and could almost see the straps they were harnessed with. Overall cheesy, didn't give the same feel as the novel. Nothing is explained, no science/character developing/China relationships/Watney's Explorations/really everything. 1/10 not worth the hype"
132," The another ordinary movie with claims of a masterpiece!
","Disappointment - this is what i felt while watching ""The Martian"". I had been waiting for the movie since spring 2015, and i was expected a lot, but as it turned out, i got nothing. There is no atmosphere of solitude, fear for character's life, feeling of happiness when he managed to do something. I consider ""The Martian"" is the fail of the year, because you are waiting for a lot of things but gets nothing.First the script seems very fascinating. The astronaut appears to be on the deserted planet, because his crew left him by accident and he is fighting for his life with the desolated land of Marc. After reading this, in my mind immediately came presentation of something which could touch the soul, something like Tom Hanks's acting in ""Cast away"". ""The Martian"" obviously loses itself not just compared to the well-known movies about the universe, but also to the movies which demonstrate the loneliness of the person, who stayed alone in the inclosed place. The scientists who says some foolish things by TV, the another science guy who is making choice between food or his ideas every time, the crew which shows theirs heroism at a very low level, all this will make me not to watch this ""masterpiece"" again.And just Matt Damon is trying to pull the movie from the abyss. His jokes are very strict, his emotions are deep, but it isn't enough.Overall, ""The Martian"" is the another blockbuster, which pays more attention to the special effects, than to the atmosphere. Definitely i will not watch it twice, the first time was more than enough!"
133," Not a new story, technically disappointing, PC run amok
","I'll confess up front I have an engineering and aerospace background. That said, I'll also be clear that I view other movies in this genre very positively. The science and tech in this movie rates low, a 2 or 3 out of 10 at best. I know, it's Hollywood, but go watch Apollo 13 from 20 years ago and you'll see a much better film about space travel.This film is also disappointing in it's apparent push to show females and minorities in every role possible. In reality, the science field is heavily male, heavily white and Asian. This movie would have you believe otherwise. It's like they went out of their way to avoid white males in the technical roles.The one bit of skin (naked butt) and few uses of curse words (most heard on cable already) are both unneeded.There's virtually no character emotional development. See Hanks in Castaway for a much better story about being marooned.I will think twice before seeing any Ridley Scott movie again. Not worth a full price ticket in my opinion."
134," Sickly sweet potatoes.
","Should have been called 'Avatar:The Red Planet Rescue'. It's a blockbuster pop-corn muncher, but could have been a much deeper and more worthy film. I was hoping for a thriller sci-fi but got a saccharin Disney effort.Personally I like movies that try to teach us life lessons, often despite struggles and hardship. That narrative was all sitting there in the plot and never touched, such a waste. The acting was heavily wooden, Damon probably through poor direction or too time sensitive a plot fails to engage as a fellow human, he's Mr Prefect and well balanced, even surviving alone in a hostile environment.I'm no scientist, but the whole of the physics and biology seem far too woolly, convenient and unlikely. Even the movement on Mars seems wrong, there is only about a third of the gravity so things should look like the moon with long jumps or certainly less earth-like. Even the Mars rover looks like it is driving in an Earth desert, not really on Mars. There are so many other examples, too many to list, ranging from not very probable to impossible.-Sigh- another Chinese tie-in. Our Chinese friends in their space administration help, and are portrayed as the good guys. There's nothing really wrong with the premise, but the reason is simply to make more money in Chinese theaters, a tacky corporate gesture and totally unnecessary to the story. This is very ugly cynical marketing, pandering to the lowest level. Why not have an entire Chinese ending then? Mark is rescued by the Chinese and they call the Americans 'shameless' for their abandonment. Mark learns perfect calligraphy, speech-making putonghua that nobody actually uses in real life (as in the movie), how to use chopsticks and cook up a killer sweet and sour pork in the galley on the way home.The saving graces are the beautifully rendered shots of Mars which were worth the price of admission, and just the idea that could catch everyone's imagination get the ball rolling on a real manned international mission to Mars sooner than later.I feel that the story could have been split into two or three feature length parts, explaining psychology, science and the day to day difficulties of isolation on much deeper level. It seems for the company that made this the idea of success is to make as much money as possible, not the best film possible."
135," boring survivalism
","I didn't expect much, and that is perhaps the only aspect of the movie that did not disappoint.You ever get the feeling from a movie or a series that given the plot - that the setting could be just about anything? This is exactly the case with this movie. It could have been set on an island, on a remote mountain top, in a desert right here on Earth... literally anywhere. There is so little Mars- specific in the plot (or rather focused on the fact that this is another planet... something that should have been much more capitalised on) that the whole survival thing could just as well have been about a guy stuck in a service elevator in an abandoned hotel after his coworkers accidentally shut off the power for the whole building on their way out. As for the rest of the plot-specific action going on... meh. A lot of ""video-diary"" stuff, Matt finds poop to grow potatoes, Matt does something to survive and something happens because of that, Matt tries to keep himself busy with some other nonsense, Matt talks to himself because he's so alone and a bit nuts because of that, Matt does some McGuyver stuff to survive/communicate/whatever... that's just it there is so little excitement about the plot it basically revolves about mundane routine with some halfway-decent slapstick humor every once in a while there is not much to tell. I was almost expecting some serious plot twist/aliens whatever to come crashing in and turn it all around but that never happened. As far as the rest of the characters go some of them over-played and over-exxagerated their roles, while the rest were just stereotypical characters that needed no character building and didn't get any either. The only thing that kinda spiced up the drama was the rescue effort, but again by that time the movie was already as blant as one of those bad dished Gordon Ramsey gets so disgusted with on his show. I don't know what this movie was supposed to be exactly, an experiment with how boring a one- man survival thing can become or something like that, but it didn't even get CLOSE to what a good movie ""cast away"" is. My 2 cents worth of advice just forget about this movie and watch Cast Away."
136," Roland Emmerich directs SAVING PRIVATE RYAN vs. INTERSTELLAR
","(Contains minor spoilers, nothing that would ruin the movie)The movie is a joke. It is currently rated 8.3/10 on IMDb, taking #134 at the top 250 - and it's not even funny.If you expect a sophisticated movie, you're in the wrong place. This movie seems to be written by kids or intended for them. The script is ridiculous, spoon-fed to the audience and repeats everything twice in case they still didn't get it. Every character in this movie is stupid and one-dimensional. It features silly jokes and moronic behavior which you haven't seen astronauts do since PROMETHEUS.This movie wants you to believe that an astronaut left alone on Mars finds out by himself time after time ways to keep alive. It wants you to believe that astronauts were sent to a mission to Mars without taking into consideration that something could go wrong, they didn't think of ways to grow food or survive on Mars and didn't train the astronauts or gave them basic instructions book for a case of emergency. They simply left it to the astronauts to figure it out by themselves in a case of emergency. And voilà - when something like that happens, one astronaut invents endless ways to survive - something that all of NASA's scientists didn't think of before. This guy should have made billions in making his own startups.In MOON - one of the best movies in recent years - they put a computer so that the main character is kept isolated from society but has someone/something to talk to, thus sharing his thoughts and feelings for the viewer.In THE MARTIAN, on the other hand, the character simply talks to himself. Yes, most of the time he talks to the camera, but not always. When he does, he talks as if he were explaining stuff to a 6-year old. I expect an astronaut to leave behind a vlog intended for his peers, who should know a thing or two when coordinating a multi-billion mission into Mars. I don't expect him to talk like he's explaining this to his kid.Characters don't only think like kids, act and explain like kids, but they also make their own decisions - again and again - like this multi- billion mission was their own private game. From taking over a space vehicle, through sending hidden messages against the commander's decision, to sharing country secrets. This is beyond ridiculous. This is straight B-movie material.Just like in INTERSTELLAR, Jessica Chastain again has to save Matt Damon who was left alone on a far away planet. There's nothing much I can add to that.I simply refuse to believe this movie was directed by the same guy who directed ALIEN and BLADE RUNNER. This is 100% a Roland Emmerich job. From the poorly directed acting and script, to the ridiculous crowd scenes at the end. This is pure Emmerich. If tomorrow the studio would publish that they pranked us and used Ridley Scott's name, but actually Emmerich is the one who directed this film, I wouldn't be surprised at all.I said it several times before and I'll say it again: Jessica Chastain and Kate Mara simply can't act. They are awful actresses and should only appear in B-movies. Chastain's acting makes it impossible for you to believe, even for one minute, that she's the team's captain. She acts like a girl on a field trip. And Kate Mara is Kate Mara, no need to add anything to that.As for the visuals, which got such praising reviews - well, they are OK. Nothing astounding, definitely not after we've seen GRAVITY. There are some nice zero-gravity shots, but frequently it seemed to me like wire work and the movement wasn't nearly as clean and natural as what we've seen in Gravity. Same goes for the movement in space (both in the ship and outside) - frequently it seemed to ignore the laws of physics.Matt Damon is pretty good in his role, but the silly script and direction ruin that too.All in all, this is a big disappointment. The film is watchable, but only if you shut your brain completely off and try to watch it like a kids movie. If you try to find any logic or sophistication, like I did, you'll have a hard time enjoying this movie."

Oh hold on I'll use quotation marks because that's not really my opinion ""A return to form from acclaimed director Ridley Scott"" . I'm afraid I found this rather boring . Matt Damon finds himself trapped on Mars struggling to survive . Early in the film Matt takes off his spacesuit and glancing at his inhuman well buffed torso you know every hetrosexual woman on the planet will want to use him as their own personal lick toy if he makes it back to Earth . Remind me and 3.5 billion other mortal men why we want him to survive this ordeal ? I'm afraid I'd forgotten his characters name because my disbelief was never suspended long or hard enough to think I was watching a real life character trying to survive a real life situation but more of an actor appearing in a Hollywood movie . ""Luckily I'm a botanist so I can grow things"" he states. Wow , how fortunate is that ? Very fortunate I'd say and this type of good fortune reminds you you're watching a contrived story . It does try and bring science fact to the narrative but at the same time when you've got the actor who played Boromir in THE LORD OF THE RINGS explain why the rescue mission is called ""Operation Elrond"" this tends to underline the fact that you're watching a movie One puzzling thing is that it's picked up several Golden Globe nominations - in the comedy/musical category ? This is ridiculous since the film is in no way a comedy or a musical . Its style is somewhat reminiscent of these films in the 1980s with either a diegetic or non diegetic musical soundtrack blasting away . Anyone consider APOCALYPSE NOW a musical ? I didn't think so . That said I did slightly respect THE MARTIAN more than the rather overrated INTERSTELLAR . It's just that when you compare it the breathtaking achievement of GRAVITY a couple of years ago or the thematically similar THE REVENANT then you'll probably find THE MARTIAN a bit lacklustre in comparison . I also think because of voter politics - Inarritu won best director at the Oscars last year - the Academy Awards might just give Ridley Scott a long overdue Oscar in 2016 , but to be honest he's made better films than this one"
138," Slow-moving but informative tale of beleaguered astronaut on Mars is undermined by lack of suspense back on earth
","After taking in the most entertaining ""Gravity"" in 2013, I was looking forward to comparing it with ""The Martian,"" which is similar in theme. Both Matt Damon and Sandra Bullock play astronauts, who as a result of a disaster, are forced to save themselves from certain death in the vast expanse of outer space. Gravity, unlike the bloated Martian, has a more than workmanlike plot that occurs in real time—the ticking clock forces us to view Dr. Ryan Stone as she battles one setback after another, placing the viewer on the edge of one's seat throughout the heart- pounding narrative. The Martian, in contrast, chronicles Mark Watney as he devises various stratagems for survival over a much longer period of time. Thus by the very nature of this most different, much slower-moving tale (based on a novel and not on an original screenplay, as is the case with Gravity), The Martian, is only mildly entertaining, more for its ""educational platform"" than a scenario involving death-defying life-and- death maneuvers. Thus the first third of The Martian manages to be fairly compelling as we follow Watney in his initial stab at survival after the Martian storm separates him from his Ares III comrades and strands him on the virtually barren red planet, with no expectation of rescue for another four years based on NASA's projected schedule. Watney, brilliant botanist scientist that he is, devises a way to create a water supply from human waste and grow potatoes in a makeshift greenhouse. As the first half of Act 2 slugs along, there's more enormously clever stuff in store as Watney extends the battery life of his Rover and journeys for days, eventually locating an early Pathfinder probe buried in the sand. Watney reconfigures the Pathfinder which enables him to communicate with NASA. One of the film's thrilling moments occurs when mission control realizes Watney is still alive and eventually devises a way to communicate with him.Unfortunately, The Martian loses steam in the second half, after the focus shifts from Watney to NASA in their attempt to rescue him. We see this in high relief at the midpoint when a breach in the crew's Hab's airlock ruins Watney's potato crop and NASA is forced to send an unmanned probe full of supplies which blows up upon liftoff. This might sound exciting but it takes so much time for everyone on the ground to make this happen that the launch (reminiscent of the Challenger disasters), proves anti-climactic. There's a brief aside involving an offer from the China National Space Administration to send one of their secret probes to resupply Watney. The inclusion of a Chinese benevolent offer undoubtedly was inserted by the film's scenarists to perhaps promote better Chinese-American relations, but in reality it does little to heighten the suspense surrounding Watney. Ultimately the Chinese probe proves to be a time waster for both viewer and plot: its lack of practicality becomes obvious when it's postulated there's no way to control the speed of the ship when it enters the Martian atmosphere.The Martian almost grinds to a complete halt before the big climax when a coterie of geeks and NASA personnel are intent on explaining how the story ends before it actually does. A geeky astrodynamicist, Purnell, comes up with the idea of a ""slingshot trajectory"" which will lengthen the Hermes mission by first hooking up with the Chinese resupply ship and then making a beeline back to Mars where they'll somehow ""catch"" Watney in a module stripped of its top portion, covered only by a tarp. The tension of Watney's quest for survival is replaced by a tale of NASA infighting—the chief honcho nixes the idea of a Hermes reboot, but his assistant emails Purnell's risky maneuver to the crew who of course go against orders and decide to save Watney anyway. The big climax is once again outlined before it happens by the Aeres captain, who illustrates to the crew what's supposed to happen utilizing a set of salt and pepper shakers!Even though we finally get back to Watney, his trip in the reconfigured rover for a rendezvous with his getaway rocket is again somewhat anti-climactic, replete with clichéd orchestral music and wide shots highlighting the aforementioned barren Martian landscape. Finally Watney's rescue is exciting enough, but one cannot help but feel that we should have gotten to it a lot sooner (whatever happened to the old cinematic axiom, show don't tell?). One also can't help but feel that Damon's successful rescue is quite reminiscent of Bullock's maneuvers in Gravity. But Bullock's turn in outer space just seems to be a lot more exciting and well choreographed, than Damon's!The Martian also suffers from a lack of multi-dimensionality in its characters. No one except Damon really stands out. Damon, on the other hand, shines--particularly in his scenes where he details his machinations on the Red Planet in his trusty video diary. Those videos make Damon's Watney come alive and saves the film from the second half chronicle of mediocre doings on earth.The Martian is by no means a terribly bad film, and I understand that director Scott was determined to create some kind of paean to man's ingenuity and self-survival. Nonetheless, the unabashed jingoism in his misplaced salute to NASA and the US space program in general, leaves a bad taste in one's mouth. With all the poverty and suffering going on in the world today, isn't the space program, with its hopeless quest to find extraterrestrial life in the universe, nothing more than a terribly misguided canard? Ridley is one of those guys who still believes in ""The Idea of Progress,"" that emerged from the Enlightenment in the 18th century. Better to have consulted the Biblical admonition found in Ecclesiastes: ""There is nothing new under the sun."""
139," Lavish based-on-real-events TV-Movie about something that didn't happen.
","I found watching this film a very underwhelming and slightly bizarre experience. It seems to have almost invented a new genre – but one that feel to me utterly pointless. The Martian is basically a factual/historical drama – about something that never actually happened. The style, pacing and storytelling is exactly like Apollo 13 (and I mean exactly) – and fairly familiar to other based-on- real-events films like the recent Everest. But the obvious fact that none of this stuff actually ever took place just seemed to suck any interest right out of me. Now, clearly, in most films the events never actually took place, but typically fiction usually presents us with interesting dramatic or philosophical questions – none of which are present in The Martian. You could compare it to Contact – which kind of used the same fake-factual/historical drama style, but Contact posed big questions – and took us to places we could never really go and so was interesting. The Martian was so close to life without being more remarkable than life that it just felt dull. I'm sure a lot of people would compare it to Gravity – but they just don't feel much alike to me. Gravity was basically a thriller – and a real cinematic experience But the The Martian feels more like a lavish TV movie which has absolutely nothing of interest to say, show, or make you feel. The film and 3D looks pretty good, but the visuals aren't exactly stunning. Meanwhile, there is almost zero character development in this film. We know literally nothing more about the protagonist, or any of the other characters, at the end of the film than we did at the beginning. As in Apollo 13, most of the dramatic interest is supposed to come from the characters trying to work out solutions to problems of how to keep the protagonist alive and get him home. But since none of this actually happened and the solutions can effectively be dreamt up out of thin air they lack any real interest in watching at all. I haven't read the book, but can imagine that perhaps the problem solving aspect came across better in print, since I imagine the writer tried to come up with practical/plausible solutions to the idea of being trapped on Mars and work the problems through in detail. But on film the solutions all just feels contrived and redundant."
140," Silly, banal garbage fire.
","Terrible waste of time.How silly that everyone trying to rescue Matt Damon is so cheery.I can see how someone who never saw an American movie might find this fun.Okay, so Damon lost some weight. But every time we see him, he is munching on something.Anyone read about the siege of Leningrad, how long people had nothing to eat and yet survived?This was a colossal waste of time.You also had the typical women, Hispanic, blacks, etc.There was only one person who gave a good acting performance, a minor character at that."
141," Never wanted it to end!
","I took the time to read some of the criticism for this movie. I was amazed on how much people think they know, about physics, etc, and when they write two lines it's apparent that they would not know their left hand from their right one. But still, they go about it and write whatever comes on their mind. Yes, the movie may be a bit far fetched at some parts, but do you really think that the script writers did not have consultants from NASA or some kind of physicists? Really? I mean, OK some things were far-fetched but I guess they are all plausible or at least probable. Anyway, I am not a physicist, but a computer geek, and as such, I really enjoyed the movie and did not over think about Matt Damon's ""poop"" or anything else. The movie is filled with nice humour, nice punch lines all over, and an amazing plot. The effects were amazing and overall it was an amazing package throughout, with nice acting, Matt Damon being literally transformed through the movie. I would watch it again given the chance! And please, please, stop whining about everything and just enjoy a sci-fi movie. It's called like that for a reason!"

Interstellar left the solar system .. it gone beyond our minds .. things you didn't hear from your science teacher but the martian wasn't the same .. I mean what the hell , suddenly .. people started to care about one person .. all of them watching in the streets .. Hundreds die every day in a way more heartbreaking but suddenly out of nowhere they started to care .. This movie is the definition of cliché."
143," It's OK
","I can't quite whip up the enthusiasm for this movie that many others have. It's fine. Good even. But no more than that. Mars to me looks very, very much like Colorado although it turns out it's Hungary and Jordan in fact. Matt Damon's performance is likable but not endearing and actually I couldn't particularly empathise with anyone in the cast. The major plot 'twist' is predictable.The effects are good but nothing we haven't seen before apart from possibly the opening sandstorm sequence.And then it kind of turns into Gravity. A movie I detested.I didn't detest this but it's a long way down Ridley Scott's list of achievements. In fact I'd rate it below Prometheus, a sadly under-rated movie.Oh, and it's too long."
144," The Martian a movie that tries to be as realistic as it can be
","The Martian is a movie of science and realism as far as a movie about mars can go. Mat Damon's performance is quite good being alone in the desolate planet and discovering genius ideas for making food and producing water and in general surviving until the cavalry arrives. Although in my opinion the movie didn't have plenty of spirit, it did manage though to make the feel that you are watching a plausible realistic movie and what indeed would or could happen in such a situation. Don't get me wrong as a film It has its unrealistic scenes like the storm on mars (Just read that that's not possible to happen on Mars) but still it is a movie it's not a documentary! I think the screenplay was quite good not so much cheese and the humor of the movie was really bright and intelligent. In conclusion I really enjoyed the film and I think you should check it out!"
145," [2/5] simple, feel good movie with a lot of unexplored, interesting ideas
","RE: a friend calling The Martian a veritable, American masterpiece. What about the false ease concerning mathematical and scientific computation? That scene when boss man tells JPL they have half the time they thought they would and then goes into a comedic exposition about how he'll say it can't be done but then he will—it was funny but not true to the difficulty of engineering, I thought. You don't see the man hours either. It's stupidly dumbed down for the audience and while that may drain its mass popularity, it's the selling point of the film and book. I was excited for a true engineering movie but what I got was a word bank of engineering jargon spewed at me and then some problem fixed *snap*.Or how there's no sense of isolation? Even before he makes contact, we get shots from his camera over his shoulder, and it's like someone's watching him. Oh, and he's always talking to the video diary, us. No one is with him but the switching between scenes on Earth and Mars make Mars less distant. Moreover, Ridley doesn't explore the mental psychosis of a man ""stuck out there. He thinks he's totally alone and that we all gave up on him. What kind of effect does that have on a man's psychology? I wonder what he's thinking right now."" Yes, he mentions it but he doesn't expand on it. And what about this unexplored gem, ""Everywhere I go, I'm the first. Step outside the rover? First guy ever to be there! Climb a hill? First guy to climb that hill! Kick a rock? That rock hadn't moved in a million years! I'm the first guy to drive long-distance on Mars. The first guy to spend more than thirty-one sols on Mars. The first guy to grow crops on Mars."" Did you get any sense of wonder or exploration?!? I did not.Or lack of stakes? To its credit, the night he walks back into the base after patching the door with a tarp is tensing but did you ever actually feel as though the mission was going to fail? Pardon my meanness, but what is Matt Damon's character even living for? No love interest or children and a ""thankfulness"" towards his parents. I'm not saying his life, or any character without ""love"", is meaningless but they are lacking in emotion. Had he at the very least rattled off a bucket list, I would have felt more emotionally involved. Matt Damon did an exceptional job of squeezing every ounce of emotion to make us empathize with him because the character just isn't emotionally interesting.And by god, another slight at ABBA and I'll kill someone. They made that stupid joke 10 times, the first time it landed but that was it. It had it's laughs, ie space pirate and colonizer of Mars, but at the same time, it wasn't hilarious. Just go through some quotes from the book (https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/21825181-the- martian) and look at all the missed opportunities. What I will give The Martian is an appreciation for what astronauts and the like accomplish. I actually liked that China gave NASA their technology, that action did a nice job of highlighting the universal interest in science and not political agendas. Then there are two good scenes I must nod to: when Matt Damon's character decides to shave his beard before being reacquainted with his team, a nod of the human need to be presentable in society, and visually, the belt/ ribbon tangle near the end. Big fan of the set designs as well, especially the base on Mars and Ares 3 but are tragically... unexplored.Overall, a 2/5, simple, feel good movie with a lot of unexplored, interesting ideas."
146," It's hard to imagine Ridley Scott directing a film like this one....
","Ridley Scott is famous for bringing ""Alien"" and ""Bladerunner"" to the big screen. Both have huge followings and both are amazing for their time when they were made. Now with ""The Martian"" he brings a great sci-fi film to us but one with an entirely different mood--so much so that it's hard to believe it's from this famed filmmaker! Why? Because the mood is so much more positive and upbeat--and it's a film that leaves you happy...something you could never say about the other movies!As far as what I liked about the film and what I disliked, I'll make it easy--especially since there are already so many reviews for the movie. What I liked was everything and I hated nothing. There is nothing I would have done differently...and that's something I almost never can say. This is a very intelligent, crowd-pleasing quality picture from start to finish and you should see it on the big screen if you can. Yes, it's THAT good!"

","Started laughing about the stupidity of this movie when he used hexadecimal system. Why would I put around the camera 16 hexadecimal numbers (and representing every character in two) instead of simply 20 something alphabet characters (plus perhaps numbers)? He seemed using only the alphabet characters.Of course Chinese had to help, but only a bit, because America is great. The German guy's name is Vogel. A lady in the NASA control center asks 10 seconds before the launch of the rescue mission what can the control center do if they fail, what is she doing there? Mr guy with the plan not knowing the name of the head of NASA? Very funny. By the way how did he know when he started calculating that the Chinese would help? Mr Martian cursing as if it was supposed to be funny and after 2+ years alone does not go mad and when he finally hears a human voice and later sees a human he does what? He jokes. Sure. That's what you would do after being 2 years alone.I could not care for any character, all very shallow. But of course all very handsome.Utter rubIsh. Sci-fi for 5 year olds."
148," Superbly acted, stunning visuals but some silly dialogue.
","The Martian is a 2015 science fiction film directed by Ridley Scott and stars Matt Damon, Jessica Chastain and Jeff Daniels. Set in 2036, The Martian centres on the story of Mark Watney, an astronaut presumed dead and abandoned on Mars after a violent storm separates him from his crew, forcing him to survive for up to four years on the surface of Mars with limited food rations and contact to Earth. The Martian certainly shines throughout and delivers a fun, intriguing and at times extremely tense sci-fi adventure, with many thought provoking ideas and scenarios presented throughout. It is also visually stunning and features perfect accompanying scores. However, my flaws with the film are mainly with the 'attempted comedy' dialogue. Far too often many characters were cracking jokes in life or death situations, destroying the tension and ruining the experience slightly. On more than one occasion the script came off as silly, childish and cringeworthy. I also felt there wasn't enough varying personality within the characters, with the exception of Sean Bean's performance, again this may hinder on the script as some of them come off as 'failed comedians' rather than top scientific astronomers. The Martian is still however superbly acted and following Damon's journey and the obstacles to he had to overcome was exciting and engaging. Overall, The Martian is a great sci-fi film with gorgeous visuals and special effects, brilliant, well-fitting scores and an engaging interesting plot with unique and revolutionary ideas. 8/10"
149," The Martian -- Great film!
","A film that has a story, great acting, fantastic visuals (and sets) with humor sprinkled throughout is my kind of movie. The Martian starts off with an engaging story. As usual, Matt Damon is impressive. The man has a knack for becoming the character he is playing. This movie really is the package deal. There are twists and surprises (that I greatly appreciated) but I did find the scattered humorous lines really make the film engaging. It was great to walk away from viewing a movie and think it was a fantastic way to spend the past two hours. I plan on reading the book it was based on now too. Personally I found this film to be MUCH more interesting than Gravity."
150," Ridley Scott back in form
","The poster for Ridley Scott's 1979 sci-fi masterpiece Alien told us that in space, no-one can hear you scream. 36 years later, and it would seem that no-one can hear you colonising a planet in a desperate effort to stay alive either. Scott's latest, which has recently invited controversy due to its ridiculous Golden Globe victory in the 'Musical or Comedy' category, takes a refreshingly optimistic view of one man's struggle when left stranded on Mars with only his wits and a never-ending list of obstacles to overcome to keep him from losing his sanity. After the let-down of Scott's recent return to the sci-fi genre with Prometheus, The Martian has the director firmly back in form.In 2035, the crew of the Ares III, commanded by Melissa Lewis (Jessica Chastain), are exploring the surface of Mars when a violent dust storm forces them to flee. Botanist Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is struck by debris and when his space suit reports a breach and no sign of life, the remaining crew reluctantly escape presuming Mark to be dead. When he awakes hours later with an antenna protruding from his stomach and his oxygen levels dangerously low, he makes his way back to the living quarters and quickly sets about calculating how long he can survive on what he has. Discovering he only has about a month left, he ""sciences the s**t"" out of whatever he can salvage and successfully starts growing food.As ludicrous as The Martian's inclusion in the Musical or Comedy category was, the film is still very funny. In one of many efforts to hold on to his sanity, Mark talks to himself while recording a log of his actions, revealing a laid-back and sardonic sense of humour which seems to come naturally to the actor. With little in the way of explosive set-pieces, The Martian opts to be subtly engaging as opposed to outright exciting. Mark's can-do attitude gives a stubborn optimism to the movie's outlook, and with comments such as ""f**k you, Mars"" following one particularly hard-earned achievement, it's hard not to cheer him along. Also absent are any suggestions of puffy-chested patriotism or evil- doing among the people back on Earth trying to bring Mark home. The only person resembling a 'baddie' who mission director Vincent Karpoor (Chiwetel Ejiofor) clashes heads with is NASA director Teddy Sanders (Jeff Daniels), but even he retains his humanity throughout. If there is a criticism to be had, it's that Mark never feels truly in danger in such an inhospitable landscape. But The Martian takes care to lay out and explain all the science-y stuff going on with clarity and without heavy exposition, and although I wouldn't have a clue if what they were saying was nonsense or mathematically correct, you have to marvel at the detail. A smart and unexpectedly joyous space survival movie, with what is undoubtedly Damon's finest performance to date."
151," The Martian Features Striking Visual Effects, Matt Damon with a Brilliant Performance and is Surprisingly Humorous
","If the latest movies didn't reach the expectations, The Martian comes to solidified Ridley Scott's genius. The film is breathtaking, the tension will surely keep you on the edge of your seat. Ridley Scott is well known for being a master in set design and in The Martian, he did not disappoint. To distinguish the ones which graphical computing are used from those that are real settings is challenging. The scenarios are outstanding and the level of details is impressive, making them quite immersive and leading you to believe that they actually filmed in those places. To ease the burden brought by the solitude of the astronaut, the synergy between the soundtrack and a very clever sense of humor make the scenes much more amusing. Throughout the movie, there is a good distribution among the most tense scenes that are visually fantastic and the others which are responsible for the development of the characters and this is something that leaves no wish unfulfilled as we have the opportunity to really get to know the personalities of each individual. Despite significant changes, The Martian is based on a book by Andy Wier and an aspect that is very similar is the constant use of a more scientific language. This feature does not make the movie hard to understand, quite the opposite, makes it more realistic and believable. Many of these explanations Mark Watney himself does, in order to keep a record of his journey on Mars. By doing so, there's the impression that he speaks directly to the audience and using a more friendly and humorous tone, these explanations don't become too didactic or boring.The entire cast does an extraordinary job. The actors and actresses responsible for both astronauts on the spacecraft as NASA scientists play their roles marvelously. From the work done in the creation and development of these characters, the cast manages to build them in a way which makes it easy to find them more interesting and convincing. But the one who I have to take my hat off is Matt Damon playing Mark Watney. Matt Damon delivers one of his finest roles of his career. With his charisma and talent, he is able to hold the screen and makes Mark Watney a character that gains the audience sympathy very quickly much due the combination of his nerd, lively and comic sides that pulls the character to a spot much more closer from the public. Reading the synopsis of the movie, it is assumed that due to solitude, the film would have a more depressing tone. On the contrary, much due to the optimism and sense of humor of Mark Watney the loneliness is far less depressing. Of course there are moments when the situation gets worse and he almost gets at the edge of losing hope and accept his fatal destiny, but his perseverance makes him keep fighting for."
152," Riddley Scott picks a winner.
","Every good story has 3 major components: A beginning, a duration and an end, somethings many Hollywood writers are afraid to do anymore. Studios have their fingers in so much of the creative/artistic development of a project, it certainly explains why so many movies are considered critical flops. However, the public speaks, and box offices like making money.This being said, The Martian certainly seems to please most people, even the critical. I don't think I'd be spoiling anything by saying the plot of the movie is about an astronaut left for dead as the crew evacuates from the planet surface of Mars only to find out the crew member didn't die. You have the story from a bureaucratic side, a scientific side, a social media side and engineering side all interwoven around the subject's story; the guy they left behind.I personally don't think many people outside the enthusiast would know the difference between Mars and Wadi Rum in Jordan where the principal filming took place, and seeing even my understanding of the terrain is limited it was quite convincing. You get comfortable with the associations pretty quickly when you add all the environmental supplements that add to location that dispel the earth atmospheric conditions. I think most people have accepted the way Hollywood deals with space and give it a great deal of flexibility, so space travel is somewhat forgiving, but mixing the tech that got the various crafts into the air and the ship its self ""Hermes"" (Check your Greek mythology – very appropriate name) builds this story into one congruous epic. Obviously, the whole story revolves around Mark Whatney, a botanist who is left for dead and between his skills and ego are able to survive the elements until he is rescued. One of the nicer things about the story is that unlike other Ridley films, is that it isn't one emergency after another. The strong point to the screen play is that it breathes so well when mixed with the various sub-stories that the movie never gets tedious or overly long.Using the word ""Mix"" is a very appropriate term to describe this epic scifi movie. An experienced recording engineer know when to emphasize a specific instrument when doing the final edit to enhance the focus and listeners experience. Harry Gregson-Williams score is not intrusive but well integrated (Credits include Shrek, Man on Fire and Cowboys and Aliens); Dariusz Wolski cinematography translates Ridleys vision to screen, and all the various departments all seem to come together to culminate in a perfect ""Mix"" for this compelling story. This movie has a great beginning, an absorbing duration, and satisfying ending.So, I give this a full 10 our of 10 for experience. The audience was totally engrossed in the film, fully responding to the humor and horrors, empathetically sensing the singularity of being stranded but ultimately making the best of a bad situation. As the alien in John Carpenters ""Starman"" quote on being human: ""You are at your best when you are at your worst"". -B"
153," I agree with all 1 to 3 ratings of this movie - terrible
","I'm a big Ridley Scott fan and was terribly disappointed. Heard so much hype. As other reviewers have written, everything is too convenient. Damon's character finds a ""solution"" for everything, or NASA finds one.Out food? Grow potatoes. Need interstellar communication? Find Pathfinder. Door blown off pod? Tarp it. It should hold up fine, even though the first spacecraft almost tipped over in a major storm. Tarp should be great.Damon is just a series of smug, cutesy lines - amazing how he kept such a light-hearted attitude left to die on Mars. If that wasn't bad enough, add disco music. And so many situations seemed ridiculously unbelievable. That's just the tip of the iceberg. For more insight to this lackluster, high-gloss, no soul movie, read the 1 to 5 star reviews. The Martian is a loser."
154," Pitiful, mindless movie where everyone wins.....
","Awful, awful, awful! A supremely predictable movie with horrible acting from otherwise good actors. A movie made for mindless people who love spending $50 and upwards to see a catastrophe where everyone wins all the time, and in-between laced with little 'scare' moments where they get the audience all worked up that Disneyland is falling apart. Pathetic! If you're a mindless sloth who enjoys movies where everyone wins against all odds ( you know that will be the case with this movie even before it starts) and you don't like to think at all, then this movie is for you. It is one of the worst movies I have seen in a long, long time.....It SUCKED! It says a lot about America and Americans when a movie this bad, rakes in more than 220 million and gets such great and glorifying reviews."
155," Gravity set the bar -- Martian does the Limbo under the bar,,,
","Well this is embarrassing.IMDb members have the right to expect that their ""top reviewers"" will at the very least watch a movie to the very end, to better review it, whether or not they like it....? And this reviewer let you down. After the first 80 minutes I became so annoyed with this film that I packed up and left.So please accept this partial, somewhat hobbled, review: 1. If I had not recently seen GRAVITY, I might have been more impressed. But Gravity showed me how this sort of film SHOULD be written, should be cast, should be directed. So I am not in the mood for a wannabee 2. When your reviewer was still a toddler, Playboy Magazine reviewed an Italian Western starring Henry Fonda and referred to his role as ""ludicorusly miscast."" I never forgot that phrase. I don't get to use it often, but I never forgot it. Well today is your lucky day. Damon was ludicrously miscast. On paper he must have seemed perfect. In the film however he is too calm, too smug, too muscular, too assured, too cocky and just too ... the wrong actor for the part. In the gratuitous scene with his shirt off -- for the ladies -- he looked nothing like an astronaut-cum-botanist and everything like a guy who keeps waiting for someone to offer him the next Bourne film before he hits retirement age.I suppose the film might have become stunningly better in the last 25 minutes but I have seen a lot of films, reviewed a lot of films, so I play the Vegas odds and say, not ^(*&^(* likely.Sorry if I let you down.I promise to do better next time."
156," The movie was terrible compared to the book
","Let me start out by saying that I loved the book. It is one of my favorites of all time and I highly recommend it. That being said, this movie was the worst adaptation of a book I have ever seen. (just behind Eragon) The movie itself is very well done, with great acting and special effects. I just hated how much it wasn't like the book. I know you're not supposed to compare books to movies, but man. This was just awful. Mark Watney in the book is a hilarious character and very well thought out. The movie made him seem like a typical guy who occasionally cracks a joke. In the book, I was laughing almost every page because of how funny the guy is. That is one problem with the movie. It wasn't funny enough. The book was basically a comedy. You could market it that way and nobody would bat an eye. You couldn't really do that with the movie. :SPOILERS IN MOVIE AND BOOK: One of the things that I really hated was the ending. I realize they gotta make it dramatic and all that, but man! Way overdone! In the book, it is Beck who saves Watney, not captain Lewis. I just thought, why? Why the heck did Lewis go in the movie? Beck was specially trained in that field. That was his thing. That is what he was trained for. That's like having the captain doing surgery even though she wasn't really trained for it. (kinda extreme, but i think it gets the point across) Also, Watney didn't do that dumb iron man thing. I'm sorry, but that was just stupid. I mentions it in the book, but he didn't do it. So all in all, the movie was crap, but the book was amazing. I recommend you skip the movie, and just buy the book instead. Much better usage of your money."
157," Make it so ...
","I had trouble with this movie. Someone should remind produces that movies are about 2 hours long. They can't include everything. The Chinese really serve no useful purpose here, as they debate whether to help or not using subtitles.There was an awful lot of talk. By and large, Matt Damon delivered it well: if he had not, the film would have been a total bomb. He is engaging, charming, witty, observant, intelligent and courageous. He does convey (lightly) the problems he has and so by the end, we believe him when he says At some point, everything's gonna go south on you and you're going to say, this is it. This is how I end. Now you can either accept that, or you can get to work. That's all it is. You just begin. You do the math. You solve one problem and you solve the next one, and then the next. And If you solve enough problems, you get to come home.But the dialogue can become tiresome, especially when nothing is really going on. Many people I've talked to found the syllogism on becoming a space pirate very engaging. I did not. At best it was sophistry and at worst garble that took up valuable time. I defer, however, to those that liked it.It is long.It does not have well developed minor characters.It has scenes and speeches that are inappropriate or at best underdeveloped It had Picardian science (Jon Luc Picard -- Star Trek -- The Next Generation) who is wont to say ""Make it so."" Well just because he commands it to be so, does not make it so -- like explaining the sling shot effect to the director of NASA. The Director of NASA would understand what it was.If you want to see how this movie should be done, rent Apollo 13 and save yourself 25 dollars doing it. See how Ed Harris plays Jeff Daniel's part and how Tom Hanks does the Martian.That is not actually the fault of either Daniels or Damon. It is the fault of the writer and the director.Still I gave it a six. That's because Damon doesn't fail -- ever."
158," A botched up mission with no redemption
","The botches commence right at the start - like launching a space vehicle in the middle of a pretty fearsome storm... hello! 1. Launches are aborted if a storm is on the distant horizon. 2. Science informs us that Mars cannot have the deadly storm depicted.Gravity - of more appropriately - the lack of it. Mars does have a different gravity than Earth. Doesn't show in the film. Towards the climax a guy at mission control informs that it takes 46mins to communicate between Mars Rescue Mission and Earth. But as the climax unfolds - comms is instant. 5G/6G anyone!?! Matt Damon is, as always, awesome - and that is the only good news. The rest of the characters are merely caricatures or worse - stereotypes. It is hard to empathize with anything as the storytelling is jerky. Every ethnicity is represented making it more like a global Socialist propaganda film. Taking liberties with history is understandable, when making historical films. Why take liberties with Science? don't waste your time with this - unless you are absolutely in love with Matt Damon. Go watch a rerun of ""Apollo 13"" or ""Killing Jesus"" or maybe ""Austin Powers"". Anyways, the producers are laughing all the way to the bank and maybe Time, the greatest human innovation, may heal us of our relieved cash."
159," 96% on RT? WTF! Are they on Crack?
","What a sorry mess of a movie this was. It was almost a spoof. Cardboard characters, preposterous script, tedious clichéd dialogue, cheesy FX, and comical ""emotional"" close ups (of some very good actors) made for a wasted night. To be fair my 5 year old liked the beginning 20 minutes and then got bored. I'd say that's the target audience. Even the always hilariously over the top, Jeff Daniels phoned it in. He looked embarrassed. Woeful turd of a movie. This review won't post unless I write 10 lines or more but I think I said pretty much everything I wanted to say in the frst 7 lines.Didn't I? Sorry Jeff.. I hear you are super nice guy and you were great in the Squid and the Whale."
160," An epic space survival film
","The Martian was on my most anticipated list of 2015 and I am so happy to report that this is easily one of the best films of 2015. The premise of the film sees astronaut mark watney stranded on Mars after his crew think he is dead, he has to survive and try to find a way off Mars. Meanwhile, NASA and his crew are trying to find a way to save him. Now matt Damon is an underrated actor in my opinion and he was amazing in this film with one of the best performances of the year. You are rooting for mark watney and you really want to see him survive this ordeal. He was a really funny character as well and delivered a great dramatic performance that could see him get an Oscar nomination. The supporting cast is also top quality, chiwetel ejiofor us one of the people on earth trying to save watney and he is great in the role. Michael Peña provided a lot of great humour to the film and was great. Jessica chastain was great, Jeff Daniels was great and Sean bean was especially great. The story is pretty simple but it is so cool seeing Damon trying to survive on Mars and how he uses all his skills to try and make it work. I also loved the relationship he had with his crew even though there barely on screen together. And the NASA stuff on earth was all fascinating to me as you see a group of people try to do good. The script was surprisingly brilliant, there was allot more humour then I expected and it all worked in this film. But also there was a great dramatic quality to this film as there should be. The style is phenomenal, Mars has never looked better and i was blown away by the cinematography of this desolate planet. I also loved the use of suit cams and video logs as a fresh unique way of filming. Overall this film is easily one of my favourites of 2015 and is an absolute must see."
161," Hollywood takes over Mars
","This is yet another classic example of a Hollywood movie. If you look at most movies made by Hollywood, you can pinpoint all of their similarities. Virtually every Hollywood ingredient has been placed in this movie as well. They didn't fail at it. They actually never fail.To go into details about why this movie is so oversaturated with Hollywood elements is moot. If you haven't figured out the Hollywood programming by now, then I am sorry for you.So, to sum it up, all I can continue to say is: Hollywood, Hollywootized, Hollywood story lines, Hollywood factors, Hollywood elements, Hollywood actors, Hollywood punchlines, Hollywood emotions, Hollywood ending, Hollywood beginning, Hollywood effects, Hollywood shock factors (which there were none), Hollywood type of Drama, Hollywood humor, Hollywood, Hollywood, Hollywood.Did I mention that this was a Hollywood movie?"
162," Effective Institutional Advertising for NASA
","As cinematic entertainment of sci-fi genre rated a six. But this will be an different review of the film, one from a sociological, historical angle. There are a number of reviews that explore the scientific plausibility of the film contrasted with the artistic license that is a necessary part of any futuristic fiction. When the Matt Damian character, Mark Watney, got into real trouble, beyond being stuck in a planet with no water, oxygen or contact with other humans, his combative words were, """"I'm going to have to science the sh-t out of this,"" There have been articles on how NASA gave copious support to the filmmakers that was described as promoting future appropriation for Mars exploration, which is similar to how the Pentagon supports films such as ""Top Gun"" to turn aerial warfare into a thrilling adventure. There is no way to know how films that glorify the joy of war affected the public's acceptance of our invasion of Iraq, and still in spite of all evidence the the contrary, instills a certainty that this war was, as expressed by Jeb Bush, ""a good deal."" The creation of a permanent facility on Mars would cost in the many trillions of dollars, something that must evaluated in terms of other needs that would not have this funding. The film was shot in the Jordanian desert, which right now is not habitable. For a tiny fraction of the cost of our Mars colony, it could be a bountiful land that could be the home of those now living in the virtual prison of the Gaza strip, at one stroke ending the perpetual conflict precipitated by placing Israel in the midst of a different ethnic group.The film was like the series ""Friends"" except their shared apartment wasn't in Manhattan but a a space ship and Martian habitat. It was fun to watch, but also depressing. Marketing courses teach about ""Institutional Advertising"" that insidiously sells an idea rather than a specific product. ""Cisco"" systems paid the production company for one in the form of their logo in the foreground of the 3D image for several seconds that they figure will sway future purchasing agents towards their industrial routers.I don't think any group of space related companies sponsored this film, but the optimism had the effect of fomenting a mass movement, something best done when opposing ideas are silenced. As a postscript, an older Watney lectures astronaut trainees on how when they get into trouble in space, not to get depressed but start to get to work, to ""science"" out the problem and then they will survive. Not mentioned are the fourteen people of our two Space Shuttles, who certainly were aware that they were in such trouble, but all the ""sciencing"" in the world could not have prevented their fate. Such is the difference between realty and fantasy.Colonizing Mars will mean diverting resources to address the monumental challenges on planet earth, where the outcome of this outpost is sill in question."
163," A very predictable movie with an unjustified hype!
","I have been following many reviewers whether on youtube or IMDb for this movie and most of the feedback is positive which is making me really confused. Is the movie fun, well...yea, its a mediocre 2 hours killer if you have nothing else to watch, but is it Riddly's Scott come back? Wow, NO! It is not. If anything its a very lazy movie.Let me tell you where I think this movie went all wrong:1. Poor character introduction: The movie started out great, into the heart of the action, no time to waste, and I loved that. You are dropped in on Mars watching these astronauts in the middle of the storm, something hits Matt Damon (yes I will call him Matt Damon) and boom, he is left behind. Afterwards we get to see him waking up, fixing himself, and everything looks intense and serious and I was engaged. Only until, he speaks to the camera, and not only that, he is basically telling us the right amount of what we need to know about him throughout the movie. He says something like ""fortunately, it happens to be that I am the best botanist in the world..bla bla"" more or less. Seriously! Is this how we introduce characters in movies these days?It felt like ""Hi, I am Matt Damon, I am playing the role of a botanist/astronaut in this movie and the situation looks shitty, but hey, I will survive 'wink 'wink""Seriously this what I would expect in an interview about the movie, not how you introduce characters, or in this case, Matt Damon.Whatever happened to lets say: flash backs, anything about his background in a none cheesy, speak-to-the- camera kind of way? I know it would be difficult to incorporate it in a movie about a guy stranded alone on another planet, but this is not an excuse, there are plenty of creative or at least a little bit subtle ways, to introduce characters, but no, lets be lazy.2. The stakes are soo low in this movie (predictability)He literally said in the beginning of the movie that he is going to survive, and with the ongoing tone of the movie, we know he will. So let's all silently weep about the money we paid for that ticket and just get over with this popcorn....uhhhWhy do we even care about him saving his life? I don't give a damn! Who the hell is he? Why is he important? Why should I route for him to go back home? Why is he even struggling to survive? I am sorry, the fact he is only human and wants to survive is not enough to make a movie about! Look at any other movie, say Interstellar, being the most recent, Cooper wants to go back back home for his daughter, we know the emotional bond between them, and I bought that. But why is Matt Damon so desperate to go home? Seriously it's not in the movie.Even the editing is so predictable it is spoiling the movie. Look at that scene where the NASA director says: ""this is assuming nothing goes wrong"" (when they were estimating how long can he live) and then the movie cuts to Mars right after he says that, they have already blew the moment away! Now I know something will go wrong, it can't be any more obvious!3. A Sci Fi movie about space exploration does not explore anything:Does the movie explore the effect of living stranded on a planet have on the human psyche/psychology? Nope, Matt Damon is so happy he is on Mars, seriously, watch the movie, or wait, don't.Does the movie explore the effect of the journey on Matt Damon after he returns? Nope, he says some punch lines and some cheesy stuff and that's it.Does the movie explore our fellow humans reactions to the situation back on earth? Nope, aside from random shots or news paper headline, nothing...While I do have more to write about, but I won't be able to make any accurate examples from the movie because it is so forgettable and predictable. Is it worth watching? Well, if you have nothing else to do, it won't hurt you but please leave any expectations from Riddly Scott behind you."
164," Very Disappointed
","The Martian is directed by Ridley Scott and is based on the novel by Andy Weir featuring Matt Damon as our main charter Mark Watney. The movie is about a group of scientist who needed to abort Mars due to a severe storm, during the process Mark Whiney was hit by a debris and considered dead. He has to find a way to survive and contact Nasa and inform them that he is Alive. I have read the book and I loved it. This movie was on my top list this year, and guess what, I hated it. I have to say I was bored out of my mind while watching this film, every second of it I just wanted it to end. In the book Mark Watney was in constant danger, I was rooting for him the whole ride and I was looking forward to do the same in the film. But in this movie, I was so bored I almost forgot about him since the movie is filmed on earth half the time. In the book, the story mainly focus's on Mark Whitney survival, but in this movie, more then half of the movie was filmed on earth, this ruins the feeling of loneliness on Mars, it lost the grip of dangerousness since we are are constantly surrounded on earth with human beings. This gives the feeling that Mark Whitney is going to survive since we see that half the movie people are trying to save him instead of seeing Mark Watney struggle to survive on Mars alone. This really ruins the movie, it took all the tension away. There were some scenes that could have defiantly been made a lot better. Ridley Scott could have done a way better job if he could show what caused the disasters to happen in the movie. In the book when something bad is about to happen, Andy Weir describes it and shows the reader that Mark Whitney is in danger and he has no clue about it, this makes me root for him and want him to survive. It gives me a sense of danger he is in and how helpless he is with out any clue how much trouble he is going to be in. The way Andy Weir writes it also helps foreshadow that something really bad is going to happen and you don't know when. In the movie Ridley Scott didn't explain anything which doesn't help build up the danger Marl Watney is in. The soundtrack also didn't go well in the film, it made me feel like sometimes Mark Watney was having more fun in space then in danger. I have to say Ridley Scott did a really bad job in turning such a great novel in a movie. Although I was bored out of my mind I have to say there were some beautiful shots of Mars and space in the is movie and Matt Damon did a really job in his role. I am going to give this movie a 2/10."
165," Overrated
","I have no idea why this has such a high rating. It's not terrible by any means, but it is quite boring for long stretches."
166," American Trash
","Oh, the glorious USA... They've been everywhere... They've filmed everything, and they love their clichés more than they like their coca-cola.What a piece of trash this movie is. Unlike guilty pleasures like ""independence day"", who are what they are, unapologetically, this film attempts to take it self a little seriously, starting with a good idea, ending with nothing but over the top NONSENSE. A man? Alone? In an entire planet? And his main concern is being a smartass on camera like a youtube comedian? Wanna see a real movie about what the word alone means? Check ""Sunshine"" by Danny Boyle. That's a real film. This is fast food filming. A disappointment, by none other than Ridley Scott."
167," fun thrilling space adventure
","The Ares III manned mission encounters a sand storm on Mars. Astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is left for dead as the rest of the crew evacuate on their spacecraft. Mission control back on Earth is shocked when they discover that Mark is actually alive and alone on Mars.Simply put, this is a fun space adventure. There is a good deal of Apollo 13 and Gravity. Damon is humorous and engaging. Meanwhile, the mission control back on earth is doing interesting things. Nobody is the villain. Jeff Daniels is a capable bureaucratic leader. Chiwetel Ejiofor gives the team intensity and has fun scenes with Mackenzie Davis. Almost every side character adds to the group. As for the spacecraft, it's interesting to have Jessica Chastain as the commander. The entire cast is great. The whole story is thrilling. There are unexpected turns. It has the feel of reality. A lot of praise has to be given to director Ridley Scott for a well constructed film. Also it's genius to give it a disco soundtrack."
168," Ridley Scott Takes You There
","If Ridley Scott is directing, I'm going to see it. He creates worlds you can believe. He recreated ancient Rome in Gladiator, the future LA in Blade Runner and a planet far away in Prometheus. I want to go to the places he takes us. On Mars, we visit the space colony inhabited by astronauts who are forced to abandon the site because of a storm. Believing the astronaut played by Matt Damon to be dead, the crew leaves him behind.He survived the storm, and improbably, he is stranded millions of miles from Earth. Armed only with what was left behind, his knowledge of science and his wit, Mark Watney, along with his fellow scientists and mathematicians on Earth, work problem after problem to make his survival in a hostile environment possible.Funny script, tense drama, great characters, wonderful acting, terrific cinematography.One of the best films of 2015."
169," Commendably slow-paced, but emotionally inert
","I am at a loss. At a loss, I tell you, to understand how a film about an astronaut stranded on Mars can be so emotionally inert, not to mention unfulfilling. And before you say 'well, you just can't appreciate a slow-moving sci-fi film', I'll have you know that Kubrick's 2001 is one of my favorite films. I went into The Martian already with a slight hesitation, because I felt Ridley Scott's Prometheus was kind of a letdown, but nothing prepared me for this. I'm increasingly starting to entertain the notion that Scott's recent work hide their inherent lack of substance with lots of flash and production design. After all, something that looks so good can't be that bad, right...right? Anyway, let's start at the very beginning.The film opens with that fateful mission that the trailer already told us will fail. Matt Damon ends up stranded on Mars. After briefly contemplating existence, he decides to do what he can to survive and eventually succeeds in making contact with NASA. And so begins the race against time to 'bring him home'.Let's just start with what The Martian does well: setting. For a film that takes place primarily on Mars, it's in its best interest, of course, to look spectacular. And that The Martian does. From the visual effects to the production design, everything looks great to my layman eyes. Ridley Scott's films have always looked impressive and The Martian is no exception.Now that we got that out of the way, let's get to the interesting stuff: story, characters, or something resembling these. Bluntly put, I found this film emotionally inert. While there are some great scenes, I found it very hard to care for Watney's predicament. You'd think you'd be rooting for him and while I felt tense, it was only in a general sense: 'gee, I sure hope the main character makes it.' One of the contributing factors is I think the casting of Matt Damon. While Matt Damon's fine, the casting choice itself doesn't exactly make you consider the possibility he might actually die. Combine that with the generally upbeat script and you've got a film that has all the unbridled drama of a high school play. This film has been called a cross between Apollo 13 and Cast Away and that comparison works only when you remove any and all emotional impact out of the equation. Watney talking about his family, his team leader being depressed about leaving him behind; nothing tugs at my heartstrings.Speaking of the script, I haven't read the original story, but I've read that Watney's knack for humor was already present in the source material...and how could it not be? The film lays such emphasis on his verbal wit that it couldn't possibly have been made up by the writer. So, the film's at least faithful to the source material, but at what cost? We've got a film with an incredibly dramatic setup, but where many scenes involve Watney talking to the camera, while munching on some potatoes. It's fine for the occasional joke and it makes sense given Watney's predicament (jokes reduce stress), but you start including too many jokes and before you know it, all drama and tension have been sucked out of the plot. The comedy itself is horrendous as well, 'sensible chuckle' material at best. What does it say about your film's level of comedy when your most clever joke involves Sean Bean and a Lord of the Rings reference? And what about that last minute romance between what's-her-name (Kate Mara) and her colleague, what's-his-name? Why the need to jam that into your screenplay at the last second? We get one scene where these two inconsequential characters glance at each other and then later she kisses him on the helmet and the movie acts like we're supposed to care about these walking pieces of cardboard. Oh, and we get an epilogue featuring them and their newborn child. The screenwriter must've thought the film needed something to generate some actual emotion. If so, it's a little late for that! So, what do we end up with? What does the script do well? The science, of course. Now, I'm not saying the film is 100% scientifically accurate. All I'm saying is that it usually presents it in a fun way. Watching Watney create water, make contact with NASA and so on is pretty engaging and it involves you in his problem-solving process.One more thing: the actors. Scott has assembled a talented cast. No question. However, as always, problems present themselves. This is one of those cases where too many familiar faces just hurt the film's intended impact. It wants to paint this realistic portrait of how NASA functions, but it does it with too many stars. It reaches for the stars with too many stars, so to speak. You've got Jeff Daniels, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Sean Bean, Jessica Chastain, Kristen Wiig, Michael Peña, Kate Mara, etc. You think that's enough!? Too many familiar faces = less realism, tension and immersion. Oh, and can we also get Donald Glover to play the nerd with the brilliant plan, but who can't walk five meters without tripping over his own feet? Because, you know, this film wasn't unfunny enough. At the time, I was thinking to myself, 'man, this movie is starting to drag. If only it had Donald Glover literally stumbling from one scene to the next. That could really liven up the proceedings and generate some real tension'...If the novel was intended as a geeky, fun, thrilling read, then I guess The Martian is as faithful an adaptation as we're going to get. The problem is that it tries desperately to make the drama fulfilling as well, but to no avail. Oh well, at least I got some nice visuals and sound design out of it. The sound of screws bobbing against Watney's helmet was pretty cool in a doesn't-add-anything-to-the-story kind of way."
170," Rushed, shallow but very very pretty
","I was very much looking forward to this movie. I read the book a while ago, and was immediately hooked due to the realistic depictions of technology and science. The book made me truly believe that the survival strategy of James was possible. I know it is difficult to jam the content density of a book into a movie. Nevertheless I think too much of the book was left out of the film. Events that occurred were not explained properly in the movie and therefore come off as pure chance (e.g. the airlock explosion). The trips that Watney needed to take to get to the Mars Rover and to the final crater seemed like afternoon trips, whereas in reality they were journeys of weeks in length. Never do we get an explanation of what is needed for any of these trips to happen. We see him cutting a hole in the roof of the transporter to make room for something but it is never explained what goes there and why it is significant. In 70% of the movie Damon is clean shaven and muscular, while at some point he gets out of the shower thin and with a long beard. That beard is subsequently shaven off in one of the next scenes. Somehow the editing did not make me believe that everything in this movie did not take place within a few weeks, but in a time frame of about two years. The final rescue by the crew also seems very rushed and overplayed. Where the book made the disasters that happened along the way believable, the absence of any explanation make the disasters in the movie seem a collection of events to make things exciting. Overall this is a movie that would have been very boring if it would have the realistic pacing of the book. Nevertheless I think the book deserves a more linear translation into the movie and with better editing to make the passage of time more believable. The movie seemed to me to be rushed and shallow. But the landscapes are wonderful."
171," Average family sit-on-the-sofa-with-popcorns movie
","Well, I saw The Martian yesterday and in some ways reminded me of Interbo..ocks ( ""Interstellar""). So far nothing can surprise me in the world of sci fi overtaking Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey​ (1968) , Blade Runner​ (1982,Ridley Scott, again), Alien (1979, yes Ridley Scott, I know) ,Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991,James Cameron) and Moon (2009, Duncan Jones). Half of the movie filling is a lot of American djaba-da-ba-dooo which I don't mind in The Flintstones family saga but not in a serious epic like the this one and Mr. Ridley Scott had bend over her majesty Hollywood to make a soap opera which everybody wanted. Yes, he did not make this movie for himself as he did with Blade Runner and The Alien but for everyone else.I am forgiving him only because the disco choice of music as a soundtrack. Such a choice can make sense only in a family soap opera to soften the edges of the harsh space but will you have the forever remaining epic with a Kubrick's class? I doubt it.Matt Damon did his job, cut his rare beard, took a metal steel off his tummy to put us on the edge of our seats at the beginning,cried few times over the plants he seeded in martian soil and did not lose his nerves for 982 days! Or it was 1052?! What a hero! What a discipline and what a palavva.The photography was a good advert for NASA and ow yeah, so many facts that you have never heard about the Cosmos that even a documentary like Carl Sagan's Cosmos would sound like a fairy tale. Well, this one is nicely packaged. You can remember it among other ""classics"" such as Armageddon and Space Cowboys. Well, you got it guys. You have your popcorn and your movie. Enjoy!It's a good sale!"
172," I am NOT a botanist.
","Why can't we send Matt Damon to Mars and leave him for real? The first movie I saw like this was ""The Old Man and the Sea"", a true classic where our hero (Spencer Tracy) battled the elements and fought for his sense of purpose as a human being. I do agree that the Mars landscape was spectacular. But that's about where the good ends and the bad begins. I never felt any empathy for Watney (Damon). The film never conveys a sense ""emergency"" on Watney's part because of his constant wise-cracking. When he began his survival plan it seemed like a segment from a ""How it's Made"" episode with the same dopey music. The likelihood of him having just enough of this and that to keep him alive for that long seemed incredible and too far-fetched for me. The part that really made my eyes roll up was when he dug up some kind of radioactive contraption, threw it in the back of his ""rover"" and used it as a heater. Really? I wonder what else is playing down the hall of the multiplex."
173," Mars will come to fear my botany powers
","Not on par with Ridley Scott's masterpieces (Alien, Blade Runner), but still his best work in years, The Martian is a neat sci-fi movie which (unsurprisingly) looks amazing and (surprisingly) has a strong script (by Cloverfield's Drew Goddard, adapted from a novel by Andy Weir).Matt Damon plays Mark Watney, astronaut / botanist stranded on Mars after his crew left him for dead during a freaky storm. Cast Away meets Apollo 13, Watney must figure out how to communicate with Earth AND survive until a rescue mission.Cast is great (Chiwetel Ejiofor, Jessica Chastain, Jeff Daniels, Sean Bean...), with Damon carrying the bulk of the movie with a charismatic performance; visuals are fantastic (Mars has never looked better in movies); Goddard's script is brisk, neither portentous nor dumb, the technological stuff at least *sounds* plausible, and a few clichés are bravely avoided (i.e. no teary-eyed love interest rooting for him at home).Overall, The Martian feels at times a little too cute and upbeat to achieve true epic (Alien and Blade Runner, again!). Although humor is used well, it could have done with a little more gravitas too - you never get the sense of harrowing psychological drama Watney's ordeal should have. Still, this is fine entertainment. Let's give Ridley a break - maybe with his first sci-fi masterpieces he just set the bar too high for himself to reach again.7,5/10"
174," Isolation even greater than what COVID can cause
","This is a space nerd's movie. This is a problem solver's movie. When you are in space you don't get emotional. You figure out what the problems are and you solve them one at a time. If you solve enough problems, then you get to come home alive. The Martian does a great job of displaying the loneliness of the situation its protagonist is in. I really appreciated that it doesn't keep you constantly worried about what the next unexpected disaster would be. It is an easy ride that introduces challenges just as swiftly as our characters solve them. The theme of isolation fit nicely into this quarantine lifestyle we are living."
175," right
","I watch this film at least 3 times a year, it's all the right space in all the right places."
176," Overrated
",Maybe I had to high expectations but this is just another search and rescue movie that follows every single rule with the Hollywood ending.
177," An entertaining thrill ride from start to finish
","Ridley Scott is without a doubt one of the finest film directors of the last 45 years and in that time he directed great movies such as ""Gladiator"" (2000), ""Alien"" (1979), ""American Gangster"" (2007), and ""Black Hawk Down"" (2001), and with ""The Martian"" he has not only added another great film to that elite resume he has also directed one of the finest science fiction movies of the decade. The movie is based on Andy Weir's novel of the same name (which I did not read prior to seeing this movie) and stars Matt Damon in one of the finest performances of his career as Mark Watney who is on a mission to Mars with Captain Melissa Lewis (Jessica Chastain) who is in charge of the mission, Major Rick Martinez (Michael Peña) the mission's pilot, Beth Johanssen (Kate Mara) the mission's systems operator, and Chris Beck (Sebastian Stan) who is a surgeon on the mission. At first everything seems fine on Mars but goes horribly wrong in an instant when a dust storm forces the crew to evacuate and in the process leaves Watney behind after not being able to find him. After Watney finds himself left on Mars he has to resort to his wits in order to survive on Mars for as long as he possibly can until help arrives while also try to figure out a way to tell NASA that he is still alive and well. The movie is not only one of the best sci-fi adventures this decade has to offer but it ranks with ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" (1968) and ""Apollo 13"" (1995) as one of the greatest movies about space exploration ever put on film. The movie features excellent performances throughout especially from an excellent supporting cast which includes Jeff Daniels as the president of NASA, Chiwetel Ejiofor who plays the man in charge of all of the missions to the red planet, and Sean Bean who plays the flight director for NASA. Scott's direction is on point and Drew Goddard's screenplay places tension at all the right moments to the point where you are actually there with them in this uncomfortable situation. This a very entertaining movie that has some very pulse pounding moments that is sure to be remembered for years to come, and put simply is a must see film."
178," Very disappointed & I love space movies
","I grew up when NASA first started sending people into space and it captivated me so much so that I would build models of the spacecraft and hang them out my window when a mission was on. I'm also a fan of Ridley Scott but this movie missed the mark by a wide margin for me. First of all, it is WAY TOO LONG and I found my inner child constantly saying ""are we there yet?"" This was the result of a lack of dramatic tension in the screenplay and lack of depth to the characters. I agree with other viewers who say there should have been more angst about being alone on a planet millions of miles from home. If it was me, I would be freaking out! (Then I would pray). Also some great shots of that isolation against the magnificent universe would have been awesome but we were given none of these.We have seen these movies before done better - my standard is always ""Independence Day"" where you had real character development, dramatic tension, and excellent humor in the script. None of these elements are present in this script. In fact, we know we have been here before, and just like making copies of a tape, successive versions aren't quite as sharp as the original. This movie must have been the 10th copy! Not good enough for a Ridley Scott movie. Matt Damon does well with what he has but he is not given a whole lot to work with. And was it me, or was that a stand in doing the nude scene of Matt emerging from a shower?I would have preferred to see Jeff Goldblum do the lead, though I get it that he is not a big enough box office draw. I think he would have done much more with the thin gruel given to the lead. Waste of talent all around."
179," Missed the mark completely
","Man, this movie made me angry! It attempts to make the audience feel sorry for Matt Damon's character, but all I could think of was what a selfish bastard he is. He risks the lives of his former crew mates, makes them stay in space more than a year longer than they should have, and I don't even want to think of the financial costs, and all because that egoistic turd decided he wanted to stay alive (and then takes all the credit himself for being alive in the end). If he would have thought about anyone else than himself he would have killed himself! Some of his crew mates had families, for crying out loud, which he obviously did not care one bit about! So the failure of this movie is clearly that the message of hope, that one should never give up (""solve one problem and then the next"" and etc.) is overshadowed by the fact that the main character is a stubborn, selfish bastard who obviously valued his life above those of others."
180," is this for real?
","I watched this film last night on TV whilst the Olympic hockey final between GB and Holland was being played. As I became less and less interested in this mess of a film I finished up turning over to see what was happening in the hockey. Hockey is not my favourite sport but it was much more watchable than this ""childish"" film. I expect in the cinema the special effects were good , but we have seen them before in better films than this.The producers must of thought do the public really want to see another of these space ""epics."" Maybe not, so we will stuff the film with star celebs who don't say very much,but when they do at least anybody with an IQ over 60 will be able to understand what they are saying. Did anything happen at the end? I was watching the penalty shoot out in the hockey?"
181," Disappointing
","Maybe my expectations were too high (I watched this right after coming off Interstellar, which I rather enjoyed) but this movie was completely forgettable. The plot is a standard ""save the stranded guy"" story reminiscent of Saving Private Ryan but not executed nearly as well. I could see everything coming from a mile away. Predicting what would happen next was more enjoyable than watching the film itself.Matt Damon plays one of Hollywood's favorite tropes, a tough guy who, when placed in a life-threatening situation, would rather crack jokes and make fun of disco music than portray any kind of emotion a person in the same situation would conceivably show. He's unrealistically knowledgeable about stuff outside of his field and shows no real depth. There are no psychological consequences of being abandoned on a completely different planet to him.The rest of his crew are a dull group that I can't even remember for anything other than their unlikely decision to spend a ridiculous amount of time in space away from their families just to save the main character because he is, well, the main character.The science behind the film was also quite unbelievable. Directors stretching things a little for convenience is no problem with me (and a sci-fi film shouldn't be judged solely by its scientific accuracy) but this film had some errors that my nine-year old cousin even noticed.The only thing I have nothing bad to say about are the visuals. The CGI was some real high-quality stuff, and the visuals of Mars were stunning. Like most movies nowadays, it's a piece of mind-numbing eye candy, all surface and no substance. Overall, it's just one more piece of Hollywood media that will be consumed by the masses and be forgotten as soon at the next space flick comes out."
182," How to singlehandedly colonize a barren planet...
","I had some reluctance about sitting down to watch ""The Martian"" because it is a movie starring Matt Damon. But finally got around to watching it almost a year after its release.This movie, despite being a Ridley Scott movie, is as predictable as they come. You know what happens and what is around the corner a mile away. The movie was so predictable that even a blind man could foreseen what would happen next.With that being said, don't get me wrong, because ""The Martian"" is still an enjoyable enough movie for what it turned out to be. However, it just wasn't a groundbreaking movie in any sense, nor was it a particularly outstanding movie, to be bluntly honest.And a whole movie with almost nothing but Matt Damon was a serious test on my durability. I am not a fan of him at all, but a friend said that this is a really great movie, and that was the selling point for why I actually sat down and watched ""The Martian"".The movie was fairly well paced, but running at over two hours and just watching Matt Damon struggling to survive on Mars for the majority of two hours was starting to become a drag.While ""The Martian"" certainly is entertaining enough in itself and for what it was, then it is hardly a cinematic masterpiece, nor a movie that is likely to become a classic movie. In my opinion, there are far better movies that revolve around the Red Planet compared to ""The Martian"".While Matt Damon had the majority of the screen time, then there was a handful of good casts to assist him as well. And I think that Jeff Daniels and Sean Bean were doing good jobs, just a shame that they didn't have bigger parts and more time on the screen.My final score, once the red dust has has settled, comes down to a six out of ten stars. For me, then ""The Martian"" is the type of movie that you watch once, then you bag and tag it, most likely never to be watched again."
183," Cast away in space. Formulaic and sterile. Decent watch.
","I haven't read the book nor was the movie made for those who did. Also I know that lots of things were changed, or omitted altogether. So I write this review with no relevance to the original source.The movie consists of 1 part mars scenes and 2 parts people talking and looking at monitors. But that's okay, the movie had only 100ish mil budget, you got to feed the stars right?The movie ends like a fairy tale with cheers, hugs and applause... Have a nice dinner afterwards to complete the evening, call your parents and invite them for Christmas or something, because the elation simply won't last.The movie has a very positive vibe to it, you never feel that the main character is in any real danger, even when he humbly declares that he broke his ribs.The acting is rehashed from other movies and is not convincing, I assume it is how they got their roles in the first place, with Damon and Chastain coming straight from the Interstellar set, with not much else changed aside from scenery and the plot. I think I got used to Damon's fake tears by now, he does it good, so good that you realize he does it exactly the same every time.Cue in the visual explanation cliché of a complex plot device, complex for you of course. Yes similar to the one in the Interstellar.Overall a very smooth, formulaic and sterile space drama with very little memorable scenes, at least not an hour later.No Sean Bean was harmed in this movie, they even let him to play golf in the end. 7/10"
184," surviving
","A mission to Mars has to be aborted when a massive storm hits the surface. One crew member, believed killed during the storm, is left behind. NASA and crew mates all suffer over how to get him back, but not as much as he suffers himself. The Martian surprises with its emotional range, at times funny, poignant, contemplative and uplifting. It is 'Castaway' in space, but less concerned with existential crisis. It is also not as po-faced. At one point Damon says ""We are going to science the sh*t out of this,'"" his emphasis on 'science' and 'sh*t.' Yes, less rigorous authenticity in the science department, but despite the less than subtle sub-text - Damon practically winks at screen when he says the line - the Internet is full of finger-waggers who have scoured their A-level Physics textbooks to trump the screenwriter. Don't watch this if you want a science lesson, but do come for some great acting, gentle amusement, and a good cry at times. And if mid-70s pop is your musical bag, you are in for a bonus. The last 20 minutes are fairly over-cooked, and they too eagerly chase China box office, but the good elements more than make up for these minor flaws. Entertaining and moving fare."
185," An excellent example of the art of being a director
","Ron Howard famously made audiences fear that the Apollo 13 astronauts would not be able to guide their damaged spacecraft back to earth, a pretty neat trick given the film told the story of a well-publicized event where the fate of Jim Lovell and company was well-known. Ridley Scott maybe on-ups him by translating the science fiction procedural ""The Martian"" into a film that makes you (in your less mindful moments) wonder how much the film reflects the real events (perhaps these are real but future events?). Also credit Scott for making a ""Castaway""-like story of one man isolated and trapped into a compelling narrative. The challenge all the greater than Castaway given the amount of straight up math involved in the book (what's is a hexadecimal anyway and how does one help you communicate?). So no Academy Award nomination for Scott? Well it is up against ""Room"" where Lenny Abrahamson faced the challenge of recreating 2 people stuck in a room. Anyway, Matt Damon does get a best acting nom basically for being a likable guy who is good at math which required Damon to stretch - at least as far as the math part goes. He's favored to win largely as The Academy's way of saying: ""Suck it Leo"". The remainder of the cast is not terribly consequential, the writing is decent if a little math-heavy and the story satisfying. In short, get you STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) friends together and enjoy."
186," Pretty well done
","Contrary to what you might be thinking, the idea behind ""The Martian"" is not as original as you might believe. Way back in 1964, the movie ""Robinson Crusoe on Mars"" did the basic idea first. Of course, in the more than fifty years that have passed since that movie was made, special effects have improved greatly and we now know a lot more about Mars - which results in ""The Martian"" being pretty convincing in what it portrays (though I'm not sure if astronauts could hear sound in Mars' atmosphere.) The movie takes its time in showing the details of what one would have to face stranded on Mars, and while this does result in a very long movie (140 minutes in length), the movie is never boring or tedious, even with some predictable touches thrown in now and then. The movie is certainly not perfect. Besides those predictable touches, there are some flaws with the writing of the title character. We only get to know him for a few minutes before he finds himself stranded on Mars, so it's hard to see how this new challenge changes this character. Also, he seems to take his predicament much better than you might think. The other flaw with the movie is with the climax. I won't reveal what happens, except it's somewhat hard to swallow everything that occurs. Don't get me wrong, the movie is still enjoyable despite these flaws. It's just not perfect - though when you think about it, very few movies are."
187," It's Hard Not to Like This Movie!!
","I opted not to see ""The Martian"" when it first hit theaters some months ago. Sure, I heard at the time that it was good, but how good could it possibly be? It looked like someone just took the cast of ""Interstellar"" and mixed that movie's plot with ""Cast Away"".Well, it turns out that's not quite accurate. Instead someone took the cast of Interstellar and threw them into a plot that is a mix of Cast Away and ""Apollo 13"". Yes, if one is to be quite picky, there's only so much originality here--or at least that's true as far as the overarching narrative of this film is concerned. If you've seen the two latter movies, you basically can figure out the plot of, ""The Martian"".Still, what I didn't reckon with is that both ""Cast Away"" and ""Apollo 13"" are each extraordinary movies--and as such, this movie, which emulates each of the two in its own way, is a likewise extraordinary film.Again, it is unfortunate that basically the exact same cast that appeared in the ""2001""-inspired ""Interstellar"" sci fi flick a year or two back are all featured prominently here in this film (Matthew McConaughey the one notable exception). As such, at times it almost feels like you've seen the movie before--Matt Damon and Jessica Chastain get lost in space, we get it.Still, the reality is that as much as I want to nitpick at this movie, I just can't really throw anything out there that really greatly takes away from the film. It's just simply well made and fun. Yes, the film's climax is a bit overdone (this time channeling ""Gravity"" more so than ""Apollo 13""), but all in all there's just too much to enjoy here to be truly critical. Indeed, having seen all the Oscar nominees for Best Picture now except ""The Revenant"" (saving the best for last, perhaps), I'd have to say that this may be my favorite film out of the lot. I'm demoting the one star for the reasons listed above, but all in all this movie is fantastic. 9/10 stars!"
188," Matt Damon Steals the Show
","Over the past few years, space has been a subject a few directors have really tried to take on, hoping for a major hit, which can be really hard. Space is tough to master because it has to be somewhat believable, it has to have great visuals and it needs great acting.Matt Damon does a great job in this movie along with his crew, but that's about it as far as the acting goes, most of the other characters just felt very one dimensional or boring that I didn't really care what they had to say and just wanted to see more of Matt Damon do his thing on Mars.The visuals are great in this movie, just like most space oriented movies these days, I still think Gravity takes the top prize in terms of visuals in space. As for the believable factor, I know not everything can be perfect, but cmon, you could read this movie like a book (if you hadn't read the original already). You know going into it to expect a major turn of events somewhere, but not knowing exactly what it could be. The Martian exploits every which way a problem arises and can be solved, after a while you have a feeling of what's going on and ruins the suspense factor which space movies depend on to hook viewers in.Overall, still a well directed movie, but I feel like out of the space movies it's not the best over the past few years. Gravity was a great movie, Interstellar was intense, even if you count Star Wars that had much better action in it. For me, Matt Damon made this movie good."
189," Loved the visuals and Matt.
","As expected with Ridley Scott films, the film itself is visually stunning. The landscape of Mars looks absolutely breathtaking, and the scenes aboard the Hermes and back on Earth are just as sharp in detail and scope. The way he chose to make this film made it almost seem like an exceptionally made biopic. Many times during this film, I legitimately believed that Mark Watney was a real, living person that was actually stranded on Mars for many months alone. It's Cast Away meets Apollo 13, and this marriage is crafted beautifully. Matt Damon is absolutely brilliant in this film. He plays Watney with so much optimism that it actually makes the depressing aspect of the film not as depressing for me. However, when he has to put on his dramatic chops in certain scenes, he truly commits to the drama of the situation, and that right there is true Ridley Scott suspense for you. The supporting cast, everyone involved, all do great work as well. Jeff Daniels, Jessica Chastain, particularly Chiwetel Ejiofor. He is one of the best actors working today, and this movie and 12 Years a Slave shows how far he's come. The most surprisingly element about this movie though was the screenplay. The film is hilarious in some parts, in fact I'd argue that it's funnier than most comedies that have come out this year. What makes to movie unique to me was Watney's optimistic point of view. He believes that he isn't going to die on Mars, and this transforms this rather depressing situation into something comical instead. But when you really think about it, this is a very personal film about some people coming together to save somebody. That's it. And in today's world, it's nice to hear an story about people coming together to save one of their own."
190," More Familiar Than I Expected, It's Still an Excellent Nail-Biter
","Matt Damon is left for dead during the rushed evacuation of a small-scale Martian expedition. It's like Apollo 13 on steroids, mixed with short dashes of 127 Hours, MacGyver and Survivorman. Much less of a one-man show than I was expecting, which gives the film a little more spirit but also a more conventional structure. I think it would've been a far more interesting, daring picture if we'd seen more personal video journals from space and less debate around a round table at NASA, if just because we've seen the latter film several times already. Damon is excellent, bringing a blend of hopeless desperation and punchy good humor that gives him credence as both a technical expert and a likable, relatable everyday guy. The supporting cast is scattered with some strange choices, though - Kristen Wiig in a dead-serious role and Sean Bean as a kind-hearted supervisor are particularly out of place - which left me enjoying the scenes with Damon alone in the red landscape much more than the rescue effort. Still, the epic moments far outweigh the sub-standard ones, there's a strong sense of humor beneath all the suspense, and the visuals are really pretty incredible. Bonus points for getting so much of the science right, too. I'm conditioned to expect a lot of flaws when I dig deeper into sci-fi like this, but apart from one notable exception (the weather on Mars), the experts looked at this one and said ""Yeah, that could actually work."" Cool stuff."
191," Not what you would expct
","Based on the novel of the same name 'The Martain' failed to meet the expectations and plunged in the hype of promotions.The novel deploys a fun and hilarious (which the movie makers forgot to take into account) Mark Watney on the journey to Mars where he is stuck for years and uses his brilliance to remain composed and sane and survive in deep space. It seems as if the movie makers were so focused on filming each and every scene of the novel that they neglected the crucial elements of the fiction. It'S a fiction damn it!Direction was lousy.When it comes to casting I guess the director lost his mind. Actors seemed monotonous and in despair where the novel is based on hope that nothing is impossible. No peeve in the graphics department, they were awesome.All in all, movie is only a one time watch and that too only if you haven't read the novel like me. If you have, you might get disappointed."
192," It's OK but overrated
",'The Martian' isn't a bad movie at all but I do think it's overrated. A running time of 2 hours 30 minutes is too long and it could have been 20 minutes shorter.THE GOOD. It looks great. The acting is reasonably solid and the story does keep you watching.THE BAD. Predictable. I kept watching really hoping that the ending would surprise and shock me but it was boringly and disappointingly as expected. A lot of technical talk which went way over my head. I also never really got a sense that Matt Damon was ever in grave danger which I thought would be the main theme of the movie. As mentioned earlier the movie is too long.BONUS MARK. i was toying with a mark of 5 or 6 but decided on 6 due to Jessica Chastain's lovely smile.
193," Ridley Scott has not crafted a good film in years
","Ridley Scott has not crafted a good film in years. This latest installment is unfortunately no exception to this pattern.Taking a broader perspective on Scott's career as a director, one can easily see that he loves to depict a humble protagonist, one who displays nobility of heart, stands up for his/her beliefs and has a moral struggle but tends to choose the ""right path"" even if it is the harder one. I do not mean to say that path is necessarily morally sound from a viewer's perspective, or even from Scott's perspective, but instead it is ""right"" for that character and what they believe is right. Scott is quite practiced at this kind of character, as he's done it in several films: American Gangster, Exodus: Gods and Kings, Gladiator, Robin Hood, Body of Lies, and Kingdom of Heaven, to name a few.In this film, The Martian, Scott attempts to break away from this formula a little bit. We are still centered around one main protagonist who is struggling, but not morally - instead, for his own survival. There's no hard choice to make, no pros and cons to weigh; he is simply fighting for his survival and has to face the reality that he may not get out of it at all and end up dead on Mars.At first I was relieved that finally Scott is trying something else, as his last several films have been formulaic and tiresome. I was even looking forward a bit to seeing what he would do with such a film. But this film brings almost nothing to the table, almost entirely devoid of substance. It is as if the tried and true formula Ridley Scott is known for is actually all he is capable of as a director. I don't mean to say he should never do anything else, because certainly that formula is getting very tiring. I just mean that it says something disconcerting about his directing when his precious formula is taken away and this is the result: a large forgettable black hole of a film.The struggle of survival is a theme tackled by many films, and I do not attack this film thematically. The theme indeed has the potential to deliver something very powerful, emotional, gripping, something that jibes with the human experience as a whole, something that, even if we cannot relate to directly, we can feel for the character going through it. 127 Hours is a great example of a survival story which was done well. We feel the brutality of the situation; he is broken down to the point of drinking his own urine and eventually his spirit breaks down enough to the point of severing his own limb off. Things actually happen that show the character's suffering, brutal things that justify the extreme action taken.Nothing really happens in this film. The plot is virtually null, and the emotional content is non-existent as well. One would expect a survival story to actually contain a bit of struggle, perhaps even some brutality or exploration of extreme states of the human condition, but this films lacks all of those. Almost right away, since he just so conveniently happens to be a botanist, he figures out a way to grow food, and you fully trusted he would do so given his profession. As for water, there is plenty aboard the station. As a viewer, your comfort level in his biological state is very high; he has plenty of food and water to last him quite a while. So that's taken care of promptly. Secondly, the social factor. Loneliness of that scale can be a powerful cinematic element.to take advantage of, but this is also ruined by the film constantly cutting back to Earth, and then he finds a way to start contacting Earth also. So that is also taken care of. Thirdly, missing his friends and family. That just wasn't ever brought up even one time, so that wasn't taken care of so much as it was entirely absent. All this together shows basically zero struggle. Somehow Scott has managed to make a survival story into a cushy, comfortable ride; I never once doubted or was afraid for his life. I don't state this with revere, this kind of contrast is simply baffling and doesn't make sense whatsoever. There were a few occasions where the film tried to throw in a sense of looming doom, like the food supply would reduce or the situation back on Earth would seem hopeless, but these ultimately felt contrived and were tossed in purely superficially; it definitely didn't fool me any.Right in line with the empty plot, character development is also nil. Our protagonist learns nothing, does not change in any fundamental way, nor does any supporting character. He gets left behind on Mars and gets rescued at the end, going back to normal life afterward. Oh, he starts to teach survivalism in extreme space situations, but this is more of an afterthought than a fundamental character change. Jeff Daniels plays the director of NASA; he honestly could've been completely cut out of the film and no significant difference/loss would've occurred. His role was to be the face to the public, as we constantly see him babbling on and on in press conferences about Damon's current state and what NASA is doing to try to rescue him. In fact, most of the scenes and characters on Earth felt pretty pointless. To some level they were obviously needed, as they are the ones who must rescue him, but that didn't make them enjoyable (not that the Mars scenes were much better).I'm not entirely sure how much can be blamed on the novel the film is based on, as I have not read it, but I do believe a director has full control of a film and if a novel is a bit drab, a director can and should breathe more life into it. I have a hunch the novel is not so bad and it is just that Ridley Scott was assuredly the wrong choice for its adaptation into film. It also might seem appropriate to blame the script writer, Drew Goddard, but the dialogue was not so horrible, aside from the mostly banal attempts at humor - though some lines were funny. While I do not ignore the significant role that source novel material and screenplay have, I'm still placing most responsibility onto Scott's lap. He didn't portray any character change, he didn't use a cinematic eye to communicate any substance.As far as acting goes, nothing is particularly terrible, but not much was required either. As a counterexample, Damon's acting in Interstellar was one of the worst performances to ever appear in motion picture history, but this was because it tried to be a very dramatic scene where he attempts to murder the whole crew. His acting simply wasn't good enough to carry that kind of role, so it came off as simply laughable. This film on the other hand doesn't call for much, so his caliber of acting was just fine for it.All this said, there is one thing Scott shines at that I cannot deny, and it is present here also. He makes watchable films. It's hard to describe precisely what this means, but I'll try. It means a film that is entertaining enough, moves along quickly enough, is not completely laughably awful in every way, never gets too slow or boring - I should point out that this is completely different than a film having substance, which I've already said this film lacks. But it is watchable, I'll give it that. Entertaining enough in a popcorn sense - you don't need to pay attention much, because there's really nothing to pay attention to. This makes it more of a lighter affair, which completely contradicts its theme as I've already pointed out. So yes, I admit The Martian is not entirely boring as you're watching it, but after you watch it, there's nothing much to reflect on or take home."

","For a director of the stature of Ridley Scott to allow his prodigious talents to be squandered in such a way is a crime. Is this the same man who brought us ""Alien""?? It's as though he HAD to produce a ""summer blockbuster"" to satisfy his corporate masters, at OUR expense. This movie is nothing but a hodgepodge of clips, gags, and dialogue that he felt necessary to cannabalize from not only his own films, but every, single science fiction piece of CGI trash on the market, just to produce a ""marketable product,"" even rescuing a dour-faced Jeff Daniels from unemployment in order to scowl throughout this entire, useless excuse for a scifi epic. It was as though Scott watched endless reruns of an equally tedious ""Gravity"" by which to steal yet MORE ideas and plot points so unbelievably ludicrous as to beggar the imagination. But what is even more obvious is Scott's ripping off Bruce Dern's scifi classic, ""Silent Running, in 1972, which was the first to explore the ""Farmer in Space"" theme, 45-years earlier. The only difference is, he did it better. Perhaps a pre-teen could believe this fabricated piece of space junk, but certainly no discerning adult."
196," A masterpiece
","This film is an immediate classic, everything about it is great.Firstly as a astro-sciences student this film was like a really big science lesson, everything is really accurate and my brother kept turning to me to ask me about the scientific references, it brought out the nerd in me.The story is fantastic and keeps you rooting for Mark, it is like you are their with him (but 'you' is a robotic diary machine), the way Mark overcomes each problem is just genius and makes for a great story.The directing and cinematography is spot on, it really conveys the emotion of the story extremely well and as I said earlier, makes you part of the story.The scene where the first potato plant sprouts is a perfect example of the great directing, it may seem insignificant by Earth standards but by Mars standards it is the best moment possible, and the director really brings the emotions out to deepen your sense of wonder with the scene and the movie.Overall this film is a must for movie-lovers and space-lovers alike. Anyone looking for a great sci-fi with lots of realism is in for a seriously wonderful odyssey!"
197," Bring him back...
","""The Martian"" is a Sci-Fi movie in which we watch a manned mission to Mars trying to explore and study it. After a huge storm Astronaut Mark Watney is presumed dead and his team leave him behind while they leave to return to Earth. However Mark Watney survives from the storm and finds himself alone on one of the most hostile planets trying to survive by himself with a few supplies.I liked this movie very much because of the plot which was very interesting. It remind me the movie ""Interstellar"" at some points which I believe that is an also good movie. The interpretation of Matt Damon who played as Astronaut Mark Watney was simply outstanding. At this point I have to say that the direction which made by Ridley Scott was very good and I did not expect anything less from him. In addition to this I found the combination of some humorist scenes with some more harsh scenes very interesting.Lastly I have to say that ""The Martian"" is an interesting movie to watch with a well written script and equally good plot. In this movie you can watch the true aspect of survival and the obstacles that a person has to go through in order to survive alone with no help from anywhere and anyone. One mistake of his and everything may finish."
198," Out of this World!
","Having successfully landed on Mars the crew of the Ares III encounter a terrific storm which separates one of the astronauts named ""Mark Watney"" (Matt Damon) from the rest. Considering him to be dead and in order to escape the storm the Ares III launches without him. Once he regains consciousness he realizes his plight and decides to try to stay alive as long as he can. But with no communication and limited supplies he knows that the odds are steeped very much against him. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that although it was rather predictable and cheesy it was still quite entertaining. Matt Daman, as usual, performed in an excellent manner and coupled with the beautiful ""Martian"" scenery along with the tension the director (Ridley Scott) managed to maintain even though the film was well over 2 hours kept the film from becoming either dull or boring. In any case, I enjoyed this movie and I have rated it accordingly. Definitely above average."
199," Tasks for your survival
","Although The Martian is set in an indeterminate future I have questions about labeling it science fiction. One of the film's best strengths is that it is based on what we know about the landscape and atmosphere of Mars right at this point in time. It's a desert planet with water and no life as we know it. Compared to what Matt Damon has to go through, Robinson Crusoe was on that tropical isle for a picnic.They never really say just exactly what year The Martian is set in. The film in that sense avoids a trap like so many others fall into. Just this past year we saw 2015 come and go and it wasn't really anything like the 2015 that Marty McFly experienced. That's just one example.Of course you can also never predict what popular trends will be there. That's purely speculative. So you can't have Matt Damon's character listening to current music. His captain's taste in music was 70s disco and that really became a running joke. It's all he heard for the months he was on Mars. Personally I'd prefer a selection of 30s and 40s music with Bing Crosby at the top of my list. But if that's all I heard for months on end, I'd grow to hate Der Bingle. And that's part of the story, the everlasting boredom trying to keep your mind fresh and busy with tasks for your survival. Like Mr. Roberts from tedium to apathy and always boredom.What happens in The Martian is that Damon is part of an astronaut team and gets left behind when a Martian sand storm erupts and the crew flees on the space ship. Captain Jessica Chastain takes when she thinks Damon was killed. The future also brings us better communication and NASA learns that Matt's still there. To say that there's a public relations problem is putting it mildly. Just leaving him there is actually an option discussed. But that goes against the code of a decent civilization which while we're not at Star Trek level yet, we look to be heading that way.Although The Martian splits time evenly with Damon's plight and the efforts to rescue him, Matt's time alone on the screen with the full range of emotions displayed is what got him his Best Actor nomination. Besides the realistic depiction of Mars, his performance is the other pillar on which this fine film rests. I would give mention to Jessica Chastain and her fine performance as a tough and yet humane leader of her team.Besides Matt Damon, The Martian is also up for Best Picture and for a flock of awards in the technical categories. It should take home deserved statues this year."
200," Robinson Crusoe on Mars - Surprisingly Good
","I went to see it with no great expectations and wow! It's a long film but the story, the acting, and visually it immerses you from the outset. Suddenly 2hrs have passed and the film ends and you get up to leave, saying ""that was a good film"". There doesn't seem to be many films, these days, that can do this. But the Martinan did it! I saw the length of the film. I assumed they would have the first half showing how Damon gets to Mars. Then the second half his survival. I didn't think it possible, to keep an audience interested on one guy stranded on a distant planet for any longer. But no! The film quickly gets down to business. Thinking Damon is killed in a Martian storm, the same storm forces his crew mates to abandon Mars early and set off for home. All very sad. Meanwhile, weeks later back on Earth, Nasa begin to notice from satellite images of Mars. Someone is moving things about. They realise Damon is alive. Thereafter it becomes an enthralling story how he survives and eventually is rescued. As Damons character says , 'i'm gonna have to science the (slang word for excreta) out of this'. And he does.The Martian works in all departments. So many films lately, Soooo hyped up, ....... as the latest 'blockbuster' & 'must see', are visually CGI amazing. However, so many of these 'blockbusters' clearly have a script written by a baboon, who assumes the audience are all retarded. The Martian, unusually these days, Is actually the real McCoy, good story, good visually good acting all combine to make a great film. Go see it. The film will immerse you"
201," The Martian - worth spending time with
","I must start this review with a confession - I LOVED the book that this movie is based on. So it was with some trepidation that I approached the movie - it couldn't possibly match the thrill and joy I experienced while reading the book, could it?I was right, it couldn't.But it still was a darn good movie.THE MARTIAN tells the story of Mark Watney, an astronaut stranded alone on Mars. Can Watney use his wits and knowledge of science to survive on an inhospitable planet until rescue can be completed? Or will he die trying?Watching Damon, as the charismatic Watney, the answer is not nearly as important as the journey. Damon's self-effacing portrayal of the stranded astronaut gets us instantly rooting for him to succeed and solve problem after problem. We are alone with Watney on Mars, but I never felt ""the stunt"" of him being alone (unlike, say, Tom Hanks in CAST AWAY), so when we finally cut back to Earth, I was somewhat disappointed.But not too much, for the supporting cast is strong and is populated by fine actor after fine actor. Chiwetel Ejiofor as Mission Control guy! Jessica Chastain as the Commander of the Mars Mission! Look there's Kristen Wiig and Sean Bean and good ol' Jeff Daniels!!! And, hey...isn't that THE WINTER SOLDIER guy (Sebastian Stan) as another Astronaut?And I didn't even mention the always fun Michael Pena, or Kate Mara or lesser known actors such as Benedict Wong, Mackenzie Davis, Donald Glover...It was fun that all these really strong actors took on smaller roles, it gave the film some heft and importance that it, otherwise, might not have had.This because director Ridley Scott, did something unusual for him in a space movie - he gave it hope and positivity. Instead of a dystopian future where it is ""each man for himself"", Scott's view of the future (and screenwriter Drew Goddard) mirrored the author of the book (Andy Weir)'s view of the future - hopeful and helpful. Everyone on Earth pulls together to bring their man home from Mars.It was a nice change of mood for these kinds of pictures, one that I was ready for.It is a very good time at the cinema and I cannot recommend this picture strongly enough. Though I would recommend the book more. You'll enjoy yourself - and your time with Mark Watney - whether it is on the screen or on the page - or both!8 (out of 10) stars - and you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis)"
202," very boring, slow moving film
",Going into this film I was very excited. There was a ton of hype surrounding this film and it had received great reviews. When I finally saw it I came to the conclusion that this film was decent at best. The humor did not work in my opinion and the audience in my theater seems to agree with me as there was dead silence throughout the films attempt at humor. The acting throughout seemed very wooden and I never really got the sense that Mark was in any sort of danger. He showed very little emotion throughout the film when I feel like any normal person would have had a great deal of despair. I was expecting the film to move at a much faster pace and quite frankly when it was finished I was very relieved. Overall the film was very formulaic and had nothing in it that makes it unique. I would not recommend this film even as a popcorn flick because of the extremely slow pace of the film.
203," High Budget and not much else
","For a movie that aims to be realistic scientifically, it fails terribly at providing an even remotely believable premise. For example, the idea that the government would spend ~$1 billion to save single scientist from starving is simply ludicrous. The film is completely predictable with essentially no character development. It fails to even touch on the psychology of isolation and each character acts in an unbelievably selfless, upbeat manner. It's only saving grace is its reasonable acting and high budget special effects. This appears to be adequate for the mass of consumers, but anyone seeking anything more than a cookie cutter plot line will go home disappointed."
204," This is the most fun we've had on Mars since the Rover's excursions and the science behind it all, checks right.
","In a not-so-distant future, when NASA is still around to send a 3rd manned mission to Mars for research, a freak storm rips through the station as the crew desperately try to abort and escape its ruthless fury. Blown away by flying debris, one crew member goes missing and is tentatively presumed dead as the Captain makes the call to take off. However, the grieving crew and shocked humans back home are completely unaware of Mark Watney's chance survival. Thereon, science fiction borders reality in a race against time and depleting resources as Ridley Scott ('Aliens', 'Blade Runner', 'Gladiator', 'Hannibal', 'Black Hawk Down', 'American Gangster', 'Prometheus') comes to form after a couple of recent disappointments such as 'Robin Hood' and 'Exodus'. Along with a career best performance by Matt Damon, 'The Martian' descends into a zone that makes it far more entertaining than Michael Bay's space adventures but not as personal and deeply engrossing as Interstellar. It makes for an engaging, funny and credible adventure as it was set out to be in Andy Weir's best-selling novel, adapted here by Drew Goddard;s ('Lost', 'Netflix's Daredevil') entertaining screenplay. This is the most fun we've had on Mars since the Rover's excursions and the science behind it all, checks right. 18 Sols have passed since Mark Watney (Matt Damon) stapled his wound after the storm and his crew's departure. He has calculated his rations, improvised on the limited resources and come up with an survival plan that involves generation of water and cultivation of potatoes - on Mars. Soon enough, the scientists at NASA notice movements around Mark's station through images and reach out to him through the Pathfinder's camera. As the communication links are established, plans are set in motion to rescue Mark even though its execution will challenge several development and launch teams on Earth and himself physically and mentally to survive up to 4 more years. The scientific ideas are comprehensible, making Mark's improvisations with his resources all the more credible. It isn't just about his existence in an inhospitable environment but about pushing one's capabilities and resources to the utmost levels in order to prolong survival. Rescue being an uncertain number of months away, Mark has to keep recalculating provisions while maintaining the constant, entertaining communication. Those lighter moments in such trying times are what make The Martian such a good film compared to the darkness in Prometheus. Time, in essence, is the only villain in this story. Jessica Chastain plays Captain Lewis, who struggles to get to terms with her decision to abort the mission. She convincingly portrays the compassion for her crew and audacity when she must alter the mission itself. Michael Pena's comic timing is always an asset in a film and as Martinez, he keeps things light and relatable. Kate Mara and the rest of the crew members do an adequate job while some of the stronger performances are by actors back on Earth, including Jeff Daniels as NASA's overly cautious director Sanders, Benedict Wong as the director of JPL who leads a team that is tasked with achieving the impossible, Sean Bean as Mitch who heads the mission with complete dedication to the safety of the crew and of course, Chiwetel Ejiofor's Vincent Kapoor, the engineer whose diligent efforts in tracking Watney led to the agency's serious consideration for launching a rescue mission. His, is perhaps the best performance among the supporting cast. As Watney explains to us, although he is just addressing the camera for recording purposes, the math behind supplies rationing, potato cultivation or simply, the odds of his survival with every changing circumstance, we are completely engaged in his efforts and genuinely want him off the red planet. As an expert botanist whose wit comes in handy in most of the scientific applications on Mars, Matt Damon delivers his most compelling performance that makes science and engineering more entertaining. That is precisely where The Martian succeeds. The film's ability to convey the scientific and human challenges while being stranded on Mars, but with easy understanding and witty humor that keeps the grip on the audience while they witness a miraculous rescue attempt that is planned and executed to a meticulous degree. Against the backdrop of disco music, Watney gently trudges along the Martian landscape in his rover as the engineers at NASA refer to his rescue mission as Elrond. The nerd quotient here is at a sublime level that doesn't overpower the narrative. The cinematography and visual effects simply make Jordan look more credible as the surface of Mars while the sfx in space are refined enough for certain thrilling scenes. Technically, Ridley Scott has abstained for over-burdening the entertaining narrative with unnecessary special effects. He relies heavily upon Drew Goddard's screenplay of Weir's book and on Matt Damon, whom America has repeatedly sent on missions only to lose him. The Martian is a complete exercise on problem solving. You solve one and another one surfaces. You solve that and there's a new one. Up until you solve enough to just stay alive. A rescue is only a fool's hope or a miracle. In Matt Damon's case, we'd rather keep sending him to faraway places just so we can watch him being rescued again. 9.199 on a scale of 1-10."
205," Please don't waste your time
","This has to be the most irritating 'film' I've ever had the displeasure of sitting through. Even worse, it goes on for so so long. I'm ashamed I paid £22 for a friend and I to sit there and watch matt Damon's big smug face spewing out line after cringeworthy line of absolute s***. Now I saw this film months ago and yet it still fills me with rage and disgust when I see Damon's big round face on the adverts and think of the money I put in his and scott's pockets. It's like he's taunting me. Please save your hard earned money and time, this film never takes off and you'll waste hours on a Damon love-in that sickens to the core. Watch paint dry, it's more beneficial."
206," MacGyver on Mars
","If you are not a fan of MacGyver, this two hour plus movie is going to feel like five hours. Other than some moments taken from Mission to Mars, Apollo 13 and Gravity, Matt Damon plays Robinson Crusoe on Mars. If you believe that millions of devoted fans of NASA would flood Time Square to find out if this movie will have a happy ending, then you can believe anything. If you love the science and math behind space exploration, the Martian is a marvel. If you like your space odyssey to have aliens, laser fights and chase scenes, this movie is not for you. Unlike Sam Rockwell's Moon, Matt Damon is not completely alone. Half the movie is Matt only while the other half is filled with a colorful cast that you often see in comedies. Overall, the movie helps you to smile from time to time but is far from a comedy...or a musical."
207," If I wrote this book, I'd be very upset with how it was handled.
","The author Andy Weir must be very upset with how his incredible book was watered down from a survival story to a vacation on Mars. Since he had no creative control, we can only blame Drew Goddard (screenplay) and Ridley Scott (director).The book is filled with science, math, intelligence, problem solving, tension, obstacles, survival and wise-ass remarks. Sadly, they decided to keep in the wise-ass comments and cut the rest.The movie feels like the main character is on a 2 year vacation on Mars, rather than fighting for his life and struggling to survive, like in the book. Day after day, he just waits to be rescued, without having to overcome much. This is my main problem with this film. They removed mostly all of the obstacles that Mark had to overcome to survive, and just glossed over what he did overcome. These obstacles demonstrate the intelligence and resolve of the character, all which is lost in the film. Removing the obstacles also removes the tension, which the book had plenty of.Here are some major obstacles that were in the book and not in the movie: -Mark accidentally destroys the Pathfinder communications while drilling holes in the Rover roof. This prevents him from communicating with NASA for his entire journey to the Aries IV site. He's completely in the dark. On his own, trying to prepare for the LONG trip. Keeping this in would have added suspension that the filmed lacked.-While en route to the Aries IV site, Mark encounters a dust storm that delays his journey. The dust storm prevents the sun from recharging his Rover batteries via the solar panels. Mark has to figure out a way around the storm without dying, and also has time against him. He must avoid the storm and still make it to the Aries site before the MAV launches. This again would have added tension, conflict, and suspense. All missing from the film. In the film he just gets in his rover, and a few days later, arrives 3200km away, exactly where he needs to. It's lazy.-Mark finally overcomes the storm, figures out a solution, and cheats death. Back on track, just as he's nearing the Aries IV site, he goes off a ridge and flips his rovers and almost dies again. He has to problem solve to get to the MAV site on time before the launch. This would have added more tension, more suspense...all which is lost in the film version.-The book has Mark deploying a pop-up tent from the Rover Airlock to sleep in on his journey. The movie skips all of this, and instead show him sleeping under the rover...in the freezing mars atmosphere. It was interesting to me in the book how he crafted a custom tent for his bedroom for the journey.-The book goes into detail on survival on a foreign planet, with numbers to back it up. It explains everything in the HAB, and what it's for. The film merely mentions a few key things, but never explains what they are for. Like how does he have enough oxygen to survive? How is he removing the CO2 from the air so that it doesn't reach toxic levels? This would have been great to show Mark figuring these out on screen in real time. Show how smart he is...that maybe he can get out of this if he puts his mind to it. All skipped. I can't believe they don't mention oxygen supply once. They assume if he's in a suit, he can breath.""I'm going to have to science the s*** out of this."" ... So much so that you won't even know he used any science at all..What's so great in the book is how Mark is able to MacGyver everything, and overcome all of the obstacles that come in his way in order to survive. When you remove all of those obstacles, it just feels like Mark is waiting on another planet for his friends to pick him up. It loses all tension, all suspense...they took way too many shortcuts.You may argue that time was an issue, and that is why those scenes were cut. Nah...I don't need the final celebration scenes in the movie, the post credit roll that highlights the actors, the final scene where Mark is an instructor. Cut all that out and put in the good stuff. The stuff that life is about...obstacles and overcoming them.Bottom line, it's lazy, and doesn't do the book justice. If you want the real movie experience where you actually care about the characters and what's transpiring, listen to book."
208," a thoughtful, exciting, crowd-pleasing movie about problem-solving
","It's great to see characters think and actively searching for a solution to a problem. That was one of the driving forces of Apollo 13 (remember, ""fit that, with that, using nothing but that""), and other films dealing with survival often have that as a crux of the narrative. But The Martian isn't something where the filmmakers are trying to do a lot with a little dialog, like All is Lost or Cast Away. There are stretches without talking, but not as many as you'd expect; as the audience we're filled in often about what processes are going on and how things keep evolving (or, sometimes, breaking down miserably) in the search for how to keep astronaut/Botanist Mark Watley a) alive and b) bring him back home. It is a splendid piece of big, mainstream entertainment because it really digs in in ways that invite the audience in, while constantly keeping things entertaining and amusing.The Martian is about a man left behind by his crew (not their fault, they genuinely thought he was a goner), and how he has to find ways to stay alive, to give himself food and, most importantly, send word to NASA that he's alive and well and can they maybe send some supplies and oh does the crew know yet? It's got a lot of science to it - as Damon says in the trailer that most have seen, ""I'm going to have to science the s*** out of this"" - but, more often than not, it's accessible and easy enough to understand. That is, of course, if you're not too scared by science fiction (or, as the filmmaker and actors have talked about in press interviews, science 'fact', as everything, save for us presently going to the moon with men/women on a ship, is plausible). It's a movie about how to keep humanity in all its dimensions going through the perils of space. And, as we see, space is nothing if not indifferent; it acts, particularly on Mars, as a place where nothing really grows, storms can knock the hell out of things if items or persons aren't fastened tight, and if anything comes loose, watch out for the air and pressure to possibly kill you. On the level of threats, director Ridley Scott and especially screenwriter Drew Goddard (taking, from what I've been told, faithfully from Andy Weir's best-seller), it's high and pretty constant, and there is always that sense even when things are going well that they can break down at any time. While I never thought watching it 'Oh, maybe he won't get back or might die', as the conclusion seems clear since we are meant to like this guy and want to see him live/return, the threats and obstacles are presented expertly, with a lot of excellent pacing giving us breathing room.The 'breathing room' part is what I mean by this being a crowd- pleasing, entertaining flick. Goddard, previously of Cabin in the Woods, is adept at giving actors funny things to say, and The Martian is just good but basic sci-fi without the wit. Some of it may seem obvious - Watley is saddled with one of the other astronauts' musical selection (disco, which he grows to kind of like in a begrudging sort of way) - but a lot of it is due to personality, from him as well as those at mission control (Jeff Daniels, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Sean Bean, a very funny Donald Glover, Jessica Chastain and Kate Mara are part of what is actually a giant supporting cast). These are serious scientists and people trying to do their jobs in (mostly) responsible ways, but how they talk is closer to how one might see people talk in, say, the real world; this isn't the tone-deaf wit of Prometheus, and it's funnier than what Gravity previously tried to do. I was surprised how much I was laughing during The Martian.But it's deep down a drama, and led by Matt Damon in a performance that makes this director-writer-actor triangle complete for the audience. He has to hold down major chunks of the film, albeit there is a lot with NASA and the other ship with Chastain and so on, and without making this man believable in his serious scientific intellect, his ways of making things light (or cursing, which is interesting that they get away with a PG-13 here by the way through bleeps), and real pathos, the movie won't work, or nearly as well. He delivers up to what the script asks, and it, plus Scott's visual scope and control of the pacing, make this an exceptional Hollywood movie. We get to see how process works in a crisis, and that's always character-building and interesting (when written well) in a movie; that it's at this level of A-list makes The Martian a special film, and one of Scott's best."
209," you have to go as far as mars to find a brave American
",In times when Americans sit in bunkers directing drones to kill  Children it's a bit much to see a film about American heroism.  Ridley Scott seems to specialize in this sort of mumbo. We still  remember with horror Black Hawk Down when we are met with this sticky  piece of mars-hmallow film. There was more gumshoe in his brother who  after all brought us Enemy of the State.  I Think Americans did well in instead turn their vision towards the  homeless around them that are piling up around them and maybe do a film  about true heroism.  This is not it and I'm not surprised that you have to go as far as Mars  to find a decent American in these times of abomination.
210," On Mars nobody hears you muck around
","Caution because in this movie there is a chap who cultivates turnips, eh no, forgive me, potatoes on Mars on a plain bottom of corny disco music and sometimes while communicating with a pack of stupid and uncultivated morons who leave him on Mars. We would thus imagine in a kind of reality show in a little stranger, seen that the actors seem so half-witted as in a great movie with Leslie Nielsen.It would be the sequel of "" Airplane! "" Reshaped for the space? Not at all, it is so little funny so much it is totally grotesque from the beginning to the end, there is no slightest gram of suspense, and the scientific pledge seems to have been confided to Kanye West. Well why not but when we know the current cost of a movie and the stunning number of script-doctors and specialists of all kinds, working in Hollywood or somewhere else, the set leaves a taste saddening especially when we know that Ridley Scott is the director...Whell,it just goes to show, my friends, and as said Confucius (or maybe someone else, I do not know nothing any more) we are all born from dust of stars and not so much something else for the greater part. So, to all the misled aliens who read to me, I deeply recommend them to wait for the DVD release. Be seeing you !"
211," Give up Ridley ... That was bad soap opera
","Completely devoid of and character development and full of the most stupid con,septs... Yeah right ... We can catch people flying round in space ... I mean it was so obvious from the beginning what the fastest way to save him would be ... Are these writers retarded ... We know NASA is an arrogant pointless institution that needs more than a boot up its useless bum, but jeezz ... This is awful cringe worthy crap ... It sums itself up really by using Abbas Waterloo, full blast, over one of the films most important scenes ... Is Ridley Scott senile ? ... Or so bloody removed from reality, in some ivory tower that he won't realise that anyone with a brain will be laughing at him, turning out this hopeless, bad space opera drivel!!!"
212," CHAPPY WATCHED: The Martian
","I had no real interest in seeing this movie, I probably would have watched it once it was released to own but there was no immediate hurry.After the constant barrage of positive reviews and the fact that there was nothing else on, I ended up seeing it at the cinemas.THIS MOVIE IS F*CKING FANTASTIC!I left the cinema completely flabbergasted at the movie itself and how much I loved it.I knew of the impressive cast so I knew it didn't just focus on Mars but what I didn't expect was just how much of the film cut between Mars, Earth and in between and how smooth and effortlessly it was done.The story is brilliant and entertaining throughout but also a lot funnier than I thought it would be. The special fx are awesome and they don't try to overdo it with what Mars could be like.Now let's talk about the cast; this may be one of the best group of actors in a film. Each role, no matter how big or small, is perfectly acted by a range of actors. I was especially excited about my first experience at seeing Kristen Wiig in a serious role and I was not disappointed.Even the soundtrack of this movie is awesome with artists like David Bowie, Donna Summer and ABBA.Immediately after seeing this movie, it has made its way into my Top 5 of 2015 and probably also my Top 10 of all time!See this movie – it's brilliant.CHAPPY THINKS that the potatoes may have been made from sh*t but this movie wasn't!"
213," The Inner Will To Survive...Multiplied.
","An famous (or infamous for it's amazing distillation of emotion) exclamation crept into my mind while taking in Ridley Scott's ""The Martian"": ""oh, the humanity"". Humanity, this is what makes this movie rise above the Sci-Fi norm.. One thing is certain and that is man's humanity is his biggest asset and most vulnerable Achilles heel. Mix in ample helpings of hubris which often sets in motion a chain of events forcing a fierce reckoning - ""The Martian"" is not a bad reflection of mankind's quest for meaning and progress in the untamed world around us.For the casual viewer this movie fits within a person's reasonable perspective of something that could be real in the not too distant future. The ""real"" science, isn't too much of the story told here - it fades into a non-issue for the most part. So, we get a real compelling struggle with maybe not the absolute reality of movie such as Everest, but certainly enthralling.The story moves linearly with just a few flashbacks that aid one to invest in the characters, especially Matt Damon. His character is one you immediately feel an attachment for, plus his character supported by a stellar bit of well written characters.. This is a better than just good story with a nicely realized cast of characters. A wonderful humanistic long-shot survival story its brought to life engaging the viewer rapturously. Speaking of Matt Damon, he really is perfect here. It would be hard to imagine anyone, even a young Tom Hanks, being the combination of likable and all-importantly: believable. The viewer immediately is cast in with astronaut Mark Watney's dilemma. Entertaining, but with profound dialogue such as ""everywhere I go I am the first person who has ever been here"" really bring home the journey of man we are still striving for. In fact, even more than the amazing visuals of a striking Mars a second viewing is likely needed to absorb all the quirks of mankind hidden in plain sight in the dialogue itself. Truly both topical and deep thoughts just as we all experience in this thing called lifeexpertly done as entertainment.The Martian is not unlike a re-imagining of the Apollo 13 story. It has that unique intersection of the unthinkable, humanity's will to survive, science, and something spiritually up-lifting. It works as entertainment as well as something deeper we all have in our soul. Bravo! Highly recommended."
214," Progressive garbage
","The film starts, and within a couple of minutes we are introduced to an astronaut crew where a woman is in command, ordering men around. I simply don't watch films that push the reversal of gender roles. I couldn't care less about the plot, the direction, or anything else. I stopped watching a few minutes into the film."
215," If your older than 12 you have better things to do with your time.
",I'll just save you time and money do not start this movie and if you do the first 5 min is the next 2 hours all you want to do is find your way out of watching the rest of the movie. it is so lame it made me sick from watching it. If this is how movies are going to be then I will stop going. Thank god I didn't actually go to a theater to see this. It is lame as soon as Matt starts talking and unfortunately it doesn't get any better. In fact I watched this movie all the way through and was hoping it would get better or that it would have a good ending but the ending is so bad I was astonished. I've lost all hope that movies will be good anymore because of this movie. Just watch one of your favorite movies again because this one is just going to be a huge disappointment
216," A Spoiler Free Review of one of Damon's Finest Efforts in Years
","I came into viewing this film with modest expectations. I hadn't even seen a video trailer for 'The Martian' and in many ways I'm glad I hadn't. Often times it's best to be surprised by what happens as a movie progresses, and this film provides a few surprises, but isn't immune to predictability either.It doesn't take long for the plot to thicken and you'll be on the edge of your seat for most of the movie. Humor is injected intermittently and it keeps 'The Martian' from becoming too intense to enjoy. I found the pace to be balanced and just right for viewing, considering it runs just over 2 1/4 hours.The scenery is simply awesome. 'The Martian' holds it's own when compared to recent and similar Sci-Fi films such as, 'Gravity' and 'Interstellar'. The views are breathtaking and the ones responsible for the visuals in the film should be applauded.I was pleased with the cast overall. Jessica Chastain puts in a great performance. Matt Damon was at his best throughout the film. In my opinion, it may be his best performance since 'Good Will Hunting'.In conclusion, I say this. Don't even read the description or watch any trailers. You just may spoil one of the year's finest films."
217," meh. The story just doesn't work as a film
","I expected way too much from this film and it was quite disappointing.Costumes and visuals were great 10/10. The music was lacking.The film just isn't long enough to properly tell a story and convey a message. There just isn't enough plot to show how Mark Watney wants to leave the planet. We don't see the struggles of him trying to produce water, oxygen and food. We just briefly see him decide to do it and then he does. Though the book covers the science more, we still don't see the struggle. We don't see him struggle to survive; we don't see him starve on a potato a day. We don't see him struggle with isolation. It's like he doesn't mind being on Mars at all.There is a lack of emotion shown by the actors. We don't see a bond between the crew built to show how they'd happily go on a month long missions to get him back.The humour from Watney was poor and featured too much swearing over and over as if it were funny.Can he just let go of constantly bringing up Lewis' music?I just wasn't feeling the 'hurray!!' scenes after every rocket launch. There must have been four where the mission control get up clapping and hugging each other.There's a loss of meaning. Is the film not about how difficult is is for Watney as he tries to live on Mars and how life on Earth is so much easier so we should protect it?------------------tl;dr the film could probably have been a series where they go into more detail and show more emotion and show the struggles of those on Earth and of Watney."
218," Brilliant...!!! Just as good as the book
","I read the book the week before the movie. I loved the book and the movie. Not going to spoil the movie for you,, but it pretty much follows the book except for 2 parts. However the movie has a brilliant and better ending than the book. what more can I say, I could watch this movie again. and again. it was just so well done. Please make kids watch it, make them think about science. I'm glad they toned down the language in the movie. there is so much detail in the book and movie you really have to see the movie again. Its edge of the seat stuff. I loved every minute. I wish Hollywood made more movies like this. It really wants to make you run up a mountain and breath in earths air."
219," Horrible.
","it doesn't get worst than that, really. I'm insulted. All the worst clichés from 1970s movies about the space, horrible sound track choices, and endless attempts to get you all-so-American-emotional but does it so bad that you just want all the characters to die. Some scenes show you so many spaceships and machinery that you really have no idea at all what's happening, and frankly, you just don't care. Thing is, half way into the movie you already know this is just too bad to be true, but as you keep on watching you realize it can actually get worse. oh yeah, and wait till the guy floats up in mid space, freely sitting on a bowl. Unbelievable."
220," Seriously - this is what movies are supposed to do...
","""The Martian"" was a phenomenal film, score, acting and source material. Movies are magic, they are and can be transcendent, a showcase of human potential and chapter mark for a brand new idea. How about showing someone fighting mans oldest foe (nature), with his greatest weapons (hope and knowledge)? This movie is a textbook example of borrowing source material and breathing full blown life into it. There are dozens of critical analysis of either, but this film can reach out to people and show people, literally, where we could go next.Its a lesson for grade school, high school and college - instead of giving young people impossible, nonsensical lessons in the use of mathematics, advanced mathematics, botany, rugged outdoor survival, - solve for X and get Whateley home!"
221," Not bad but is it good? Maybe. Great? Nope no way.
","To start off, I will say that I think this movie is quite decent and watchable, it may even be considered good if one's feeling generous, but it's far from being considered even close to great. To know why I think so, continue reading. The things to like about this movie are present on the surface, good acting, good cinematography, decent direction, Matt Damon plays a likable eternal optimist who actually makes a lot of effort to survive and I really was liking the film till the first half, some minor discrepancies here and there but nothing major, then the quality took a significant drop. At one point well into the second half a plan to rescue Mark Watney (Matt Damon) falls apart and the chips are down, NASA is cornered, and suddenly the Chinese step in to help out Watney....this is bad writing 101. What if the Chinese had failed, who else did you have? Russia? India? At that point it was clear that Mark Watney was not going to die because the writer doesn't want him to die; the writer will go to absurd lengths to keep him alive, and warp common sense if need be. Any film that introduces these ""convenient act of god solutions"" loses the faith of the audience; up til that point I was so emotionally invested in the film and suddenly it felt as if the film had betrayed my trust, and when that happened I stopped caring about Watney because what's the point? The film will pull out another ace out of their sleeve the next time the stakes are high. This is the biggest flaw of The Martian, no matter how accurate and scientific it was it was illogical (yes both are exclusive concepts to one another), and whenever the ""shit was about to hit the ceiling"" I knew everything was going to work out and that made this movie painfully predictable. Don't get me wrong I thought it was a decent film, there are a handful of tidbits I enjoyed, I liked that Ridley Scott imitated the surgery scene from his Prometheus but it's not even half as grueling as Prometheus' C-section self surgery, kind of a self appreciation sequence there but I enjoyed it. Also I liked Matt Damon's role he was earnest but don't expect anything at the level of Sandra Bullock in Gravity or Tom Hanks in Castaway (similar situation though not in space). The supporting cast is excellent as well, Chiwetel Ejiofor is the second lead and is fantastic in this film as Vincent Kapoor, a role originally meant for India's Irrfan Khan who had to pass on this because he was committed to multiple other films, that's a shame because he could have really left a mark here. Jessica Chastain is very good in her small role but her screen time is too brief, an actor of her caliber deserves better. Michael Pena played the usual big hearted lovable Mexican like he has done maybe 500 times before? One of the most talented Latino actor in Hollywood and he get's stuck with the same old shtick in every movie. Rest are OK and get the job done. I was also quite irritated by Community' s Donald Glover who is supposed to be a bright physicist but can't join two sentences together and acts like a complete buffoon which was almost physically painful to watch. I also wished the movie gave some screen time to Watney's parents, it was expressly said in the film they were close and it's odd to see the whole world cheering and rooting for Watney and his parents don't show up and their side of the story is not explored. The film also drew a chuckle from me when Sean Bean's character at NASA explains why a certain project was named Elrond (I am huge LOTR nerd). The good news is at least it's better than Exodus which was borderline unwatchable, and a very small improvement over Prometheus. The Martian is a classic example of a movie which has accurate science and still is illogical while some other films may have inaccurate science but are better movies than The Martian because they are logical and play within the rules set in their universe. In conclusion, I would recommend watching Gravity instead, a better film with better editing,acting, direction and tighter run time (91 minutes) compared to The Martian (141 minutes)."
222," It Won't Really Make An Impression On You
","I began to feel somewhat uneasy about the storyline when during the opening sequence of the film, the huge NASA lander was suddenly struck by a violent hurricane force winds on the surface of Mars. The huge multi-story lander ship becomes at-risk for toppling over in the strong winds, and for the next few minutes the camera frantically cuts back and forth between a computer screen indicating the ship's angle of tilt in the wind, and several crewman who are excitedly urging the captain to launch in the middle of the violent wind storm. Presumably the sequence in which the lander nearly topples over in the wind storm was supposed to build suspense, but rather than building suspense it simply came across as a tired sci-fi cliché, reminiscent of the scene in the movie 2012, in which all of the main characters watched a digital clock count down the number of seconds until the monster wave arrived. Come on Hollywood, the audience is smarter than that! For the most part Matt Damon does a passable job of pretending to be an astronaut stranded on Mars, but his character lacks any of the emotional depth displayed by Tom Hank's character in the movie Cast Away. Although Damon's character eventually looks like he could use a shave and a haircut, he always appears as though he just stepped out of the gym, and his eyes are always twinkling for the camera. (I suspect that middle-aged mothers taking their young sons to see this movie will enjoy Damon's character.) Additionally, I really wanted to believe that Jeff Daniels was capable of playing the complex role of a NASA bureaucrat, but Daniels' character seems more like a shallow blow dried character from some anti-Wall Street movie, rather than someone with a scientific background.The rest of the NASA ground crew is made up of the usual predictable quirky nerd characters, and absolutely none of the Earth bound characters seem real, or deliver performances that are memorable or worthwhile. Another annoyance with this film is the fact that Damon's character constantly proclaims that he will use ""Science"" in order to stay alive, but the film itself is absolutely choked full of all sorts of glaring scientific flaws, beginning with the hurricane force storm at the beginning of the movie. The bottom line is that ""The Martian"" isn't a tense science fiction thriller, with at least some pretense of accuracy (Contact, Deep Impact, or Gravity) but on the other hand the film also lacks any real action or suspense such as ""Mission to Mars"", or ""Red Planet"". It is a very confused film. The only saving grace this film has is the stunning vista shots of Mars, which appear to look absolutely authentic. Go ahead and see it, but a few days later you won't even think about it afterwards."
223," Great Movie
","Didn't have much hope for this movie however it turned out to be one of my favorite movie for this year. This movie kept me to the edge of my seat the entire movie wondering what was going to happen next.each scene rolls on from the next smoothly, there is a lot of emotion that get you to really care about the characters and their situations all mixed in with some comedy which suites matt damon well.the movie jumps strait into the plot so there isn't any waiting for the plot to start and keeps you interested the entire movie.Overall this was a fantastic movie and i would defiantly watch it again."
224," The Martian is absolutely worth checking out
","Mark Watney: ""F**k you Mars"".The story is about astronaut Mark Watney is separated from his party following a fierce storm and left behind after being presumed dead. But he has survived and with few supplies, he will have to rely on his own ingenuity to survive and figure out a way to Earth that he is still alive.You can slap Ridley Scott's name on anything and everyone (including me) will go see it. It's so awesome that you still can go to the cinema today and see a new film directed by the guy who brought us Alien, now that's freaking awesome. But Ridley can be a hit or miss with the movies that he's releasing recently such as: Robin Hood, The Counselor and Exodus: Gods and Kings, but Prometheus (In my opinion) was pretty good and I know a lot of people may not like that movie and that's okay if you didn't like it, but I did. When I first heard about The Martian being directed by Ridley Scott, I was exciting but nervous at the same time, because as I said before about Ridley being a mix bag recently. But I kept a positive and open mind, I mean this might be the film that Ridley Scott finally went back to he's roots from the good old days. After seeing The Martian on my first viewing I liked it, but I wasn't amazed by it. It's not until the movie actually started to grow on me as I thought about it more and more, and now after thinking about it for awhile now, I can safely say that The Martian is a great movie. Ridley Scott's back everyone.Matt Damon plays Mark Watney brilliantly in this movie and this might actually be the best performance I've seen from Damon. He's hilarious, always positive and never gives up even when a lot of things don't go quite as planned, he always finds away. I also love how Damon's character can crack a joke there and then even when he's in this horrible situation; and to me it made he's character more relatable and likable. This is Matt Damon finest work as he was terrific in this movie.Ridley Scott's directing in this movie was absolutely magnificent and this has to be one of he's best films in years. The movie isn't all hilarious as there were some real suspenseful scenes in this movie, but what I thought was so brilliantly well done is that Ridley Scott mixed the humor and the suspense perfectly together. Nicely done Ridley. The rest of cast: Jessica Chastain, Kate Mara, Sean Bean, Jeff Daniels and Chiwetel Ekiofor were all freaking great in this movie. Everyone in this movie was great.The writing has to be the biggest strength in this whole movie, because it was clever, funny, never lost me attention and it had a fantastic sense of humor to itself. It matched the tone of the movie perfectly as I felt that The Martian needed this type of tone. Now for the problems: My only flaw in this movie is this 25 minute sequence where it cuts back to earth with the NASA crew talking about different ways of bringing Mark back, but the stuff on Mars was more interesting. I'm not saying it was bad as the earth stuff scene was handled well and it was very well acted, but I was more interested on the stuff that was happening on Mars with Damon's character. Overall The Martian is absolutely worth checking out. This is Ridley Scott's and Matt Damon's best work in years. It's beautifully shot, well acted and a entertaining movie."
225," Great movie
","I am not a fan of either Sci-Fi movies or Matt Damon, but I have to say, this movie was great! It was so well made and had a very interesting storyline. The film touched upon many typical themes like survival, man's fight against hopelessness and the classical ""how far are we willing to go to save just one person"". Next to that the film had a lot of humor as well, which was very wise , since the plot at times was kinda slow.... This made sure you were never bored.Matt Damon was perfect for the role.I also wanna add that it was great for me as a Norwegian to see one of my countrymen star in a Hollywood movie. Aksel Hennie, one of the crew members in the movie, is Norwegian. Go see this movie! Even if you don't like space and Sci-Fi.. Trust me, you are gonna like it anyway."
226," Ridley, Ridley
","You, lucky guy. One day you got stamped Blade Runner on your forehead and we get distracted by this when there is a new flick with your name showing up on screens. Well, no longer for me. I praise you for the 1982 film, but that will be all. Maybe back then you had a good team, a more flexible budget, or more freedom from the producers. Not going to call you a one wonder hit, only by respect for the quality of the movie that is still linked today to your name.But ever since, things (movies) were all of the same unnoticeable artistic achievement. Yes there have been some Oscars along the way. But Oscar means more blockbuster vibe than artistic accomplishment.Nothing new with the Martian either. Except maybe the plot is something more of a theater play. Dry in action, emotions, suspense, novelty. It feels like Mars. Dry and lifeless. As lifeless as this long term traveling space ships interior design.There are however moments when something seems to be happening. There are some potential powerful emotional moments but they get scrapped. For example, when he gets off Mars and is about to return to the ship that will get him back home, what a potentially powerful and magical moment to catch his emotions as he sees humans for the first time after such a long period. Instead, the film chooses to replace such scene some useless last-moment out of the frame action event. Why? Why replacing such a moment that has built up from the beginning of the movie with some cheap action? It's like throwing in the garbage bin a $500,000 Pre-Columbian statue that you carelessly bough off a garage sale because it didn't match your dining room walls color."
227," One of the best in 2015
","Ever since I watched the trailer I knew it was going to be a good, fun movie to watch. Did not know it was going to be one of the best movies 2015 would have to offer. High Oscar chances.Great directing, equally good and interesting screenplay are followed by first class acting. Writers managed to put just enough of that comedy element in a non-comedy movie to make it perfect. Does not get boring for a second, always keeps it interesting.If you like ""Interstellar"" by Christopher Nolan make sure to go see this movie. ""The Martian"" is similar to ""Interstellar"", but without all that scientific stuff that gets you confused and prolongs the movie.Highly recommended!"
228," Sporadically entertaining but slighter than expected.
","Ridley Scott's latest arrived with a significant measure of critical praise, but ultimately left me feeling a little disappointed. It's neither funny enough to be a comedy, nor tense enough to be an edge-of-the-seat thriller. Opening up with a scene of scientists operating on planet Mars, a storm hits the site and as the astronauts make their escape, Matt Damon's botanist, Mark Watney is left behind when hit by flying debris. The initial scenes of Watney attending to his wounds, realising he has to survive for potentially years before being rescued, and then setting about his tech- survivalist existence is pretty entertaining. However, as Earth and, later, his former crew on board space station Hermes learn that he has survived, the film starts to unravel. A stellar but unwieldy cast begin planning his rescue, via a series of clichéd press conferences, bizarre skype calls with Bruce Ng, the director of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and meetings with Sean Bean's Mitch Henderson, struggling to act his way out of a (now 5p) pound shop bag. I found that once Watney had solved a few problems, his plight became less and less interesting, when all signs pointed to a successful, against all the odds, rescue by his former crew on Hermes. Don Glover's appearance as, ahem, astrodynamicist Rich Purnell allowed the former Community star to go through his full range of facial gurns, but, in the end, was just yet another character at NASA we didn't need. Add to this Kristen Wiig's pointless turn as a NASA PR guru and we end up with a galaxy of stars fighting for screen time.On board the Hermes, Michael Pena's Martinez is a fun character and featured in my favourite scene, darkly cajoling Watney for being a botanist. However, the ensuing decision for all to add 500+ days to their mission time to rescue him is slightly preposterous. This would be forgivable if the rescue mission itself wasn't so predictable. I also didn't find Damon's Watney in any way as charming as other people seem to have and was praying vainly he'd suffocate out in space. I think the recent spate of intelligent sci fi movies has led to a new audience, which can only be a good thing. However, I just feel this has maybe meant a less critical eye is being cast. It's entertaining in parts, but compared to the likes of Interstellar it's far too slight. Compare it to Duncan Jones' Moon and it lacks enough pathos. Compare it to Edge of Tomorrow and it's not enough fun. Wait until it's on DVD."
229," a highly unrealistic space rescue story
","The film is well shot, the Mars sceneries are great and Matt Damon does a very good job in the leading role.But all of it is extremely unrealistic. If you are like me, when I am watching Tom and Jerry (yes the animation series) then I willingly suspend my critical judgment. This was however not possible with this film.Too often I got ""woken up"" with the next unrealistic decision making step in the story.If you are like me, a person who NEEDS the story to be plausible to enjoy it, that film is NOT for you, I promise.If however, the degree of realism in how the story develops does not bother you at all, and you have time to kill, then you might enjoy this film.3/10 for me.Not recommended"
230," I'm going to have to review the sh*t out of this
","THE MARTIAN follows botanist Mark Watney who, during a manned mission to Mars, is hit by a fierce storm and left behind by his crew who presume that he's dead. But little did they know that he's still very much alive, stranded on the hostile planet. With limited resources at hand, Watney must draw upon his ingenuity in order to survive. Having only seen the trailers, I went into this film unaware of how much humor there would actually be. In that regard, it's quite faithful to the source material; Drew Goddard was able to inherit author Andy Weir's snarky dialogue and translate it from the pages of a novel onto the pages of a screenplay, while Sir Ridley Scott brought it all to life. Speaking of Ridley Scott, it looked as if the legendary director's best days were behind him, entering a career slump of sorts with The Counselor and Exodus: Gods and Kings, both of which were dull and uninspired chapters of his otherwise impressive filmography. THE MARTIAN, however, marks Ridley Scott 's return to form. It's captivating from beginning to end, enjoyable from beginning to end, and is full of personality from, you guessed it, beginning to end.A lot of that personality, if not all of it, is due to the incredible group of actors that have been rounded up here, most notably Matt Damon. If not for him and the way he charismatically delivers his lines the sarcastic dialogue, which is really just Damon talking to a video recorder, would 've just ended up being really awkward. Chewitel Ejiofor and Jessica Chastain both make strong impressions as well, along with the rest of the cast who have small, yet potent moments of their own. Despite having convincing performances, the film didn't do as good of a job trying to get me to naturally invest in these characters. Sure, you care for Mark Watney's life but that's only because of the situations that the story places him in and forces him to face; there was no real emotional through line for me to grab hold of. But the thing that stops me from calling THE MARTIAN ""great"" is that it's a very safe, by the numbers, sci-fi film. It doesn't have the technical drive of Gravity or the emotional punch of Interstellar; it's very good, but it could've been so much more."
231," Good but nothing mind blowing
","The Martian was an entertaining movie, however don't be fooled by the ridiculously high ratings that this is a classic, intense experience that is on par with Gravity. The film underachieves in far too many categories for this to become even a worthy comparison. The film boasts fantastic visual effects and the Mars atmosphere is rendered beautifully, however the main issues inherent with the film reside mostly in the script and tone the filmmakers choose to employ in order to tell this story.Firstly, the film's mostly light tone cannot compensate for it's sprawling 140 minute length. Throughout the film, astronaut Mark Watney (Likably played by Matt Damon) is relentlessly optimistic about his predicament. So optimistic in fact that, apart from a couple of instances of psychological breakdowns, Mark is portrayed as ultimately a flawless character. This results in the film not being nearly as interesting or engaging as it could be, as the audience rarely gets the sense that Mark's situation could very well end in death. This lack of character depth transcends to the countless other characters on Earth. There are many great actors here, but because of the limitations of the script, none of them ever really rise above the stereotypes or caricatures in their respective characters.The overall light tone of the film gives off the sense that not much is at stake, therefore resulting in a much less compelling film had it been made as a more serious drama. Despite being released around Oscar season, the film gives off the impression that it would have been more at home during the summer blockbuster season, as the frequent wisecracks, retro soundtrack and jokey tone are far more reminiscent of the Marvel movies than films like Gravity or Interstellar. This means that the film begins to grow slightly tedious in it's latter half, as the 140 minute film begins to drag because of the lack of intensity and urgency.A curious thing, however, is that despite this length, director Ridley Scott chooses to rush through many defining moments of the film. For example, literally within the first few minutes Mark is left behind on Mars by his crew. While this does make for a fairly riveting and exciting opening, the cost of character development and the chance to really get invested in Mark's relationship with his crewmates is too great. Scott also rushes through Mark's rescue sequence at the end of the film, which is a shame since it's a key moment in the film and what is there is quite enthralling. It's just that the main problem with this scene is that it's a glimmer of what The Martian could have been, intense, life threatening situations dramatically conveyed with atmospheric space visuals.Overall, The Martian is a disappointment. It is a film that failed to deliver on it's potential. I have not read the book the movie was based on so I can't comment on how faithful to the source material it is, but overall, I was let down by The Martian. The character development was lacking and the choice to tell this story with a light tone just didn't completely work for a 140 minute film, as it rarely feels that nothing is at stake, which resulted in a predictable movie. While it seems that most audiences are embracing the lighter and jokier vibe this film has, it unfortunately becomes the film's undoing, as the comedy robs the story of dramatic tension."
232," What about the ethics of it all?
","As they say, my first IMDb review. I am just surprised (and worried) of the amount of people praising this movie and calling it the best movie ever. It makes me suspect they are either very young, or very ignorant. None of my business, but an 8 for this film is an insult to cinematography. I will skip the part with the scientific implausibility of it all, since I am no master in Physics/Botany. It's a Hollywood movie, I would have tolerated it. I will also choose to ignore the bad acting, shallow lines and virtually no character development. What bothered me most was the absence of humanity in it. First, I couldn't see the characters as real humans, with feelings other than Hollywoodian bravery. The main character spends years in complete seclusion, yet we never see him having a breakdown or considering suicide. I understand astronauts have a strong psychological profile and that it might have been ironic to see Matt Damon going crazy again on a foreign planet, but it'd have been way more humanly understandable.Also, his team has no second thoughts in abandoning their families some months more in order to engage in a dangerous and not very certain rescue operation. I'm no astronaut, obviously, but I'm quite sure they are human too, and must have at least some selfish impulses, if not acts. I also found it funny how they *subtly* let us know the captain is happily married, so that we do not suspect some erotic/love interests in the operation.Last but not least, what is all this fuss about rescuing Matt Damon and spending zillions of dollars and energy on this mission? I can understand the idealism of it, I just find it is painfully ironic that not even one character in the whole movie mentions the tremendous cost&absurdity of the mission. Thousands of people die daily due to absence of food, water or medical supplies, there are wars storming across the world, diseases, refugee crisis, and all the earth cares for is saving this one person who is very good at growing potatoes using their own poop.I understand the thing that humanity needs to be evolving, and that space seems to be our next level of discovery. It just seems to me we're forgetting of the humans right next to us in the process.Ah, and another aspect I did not enjoy at all was the part where the martian gets rid of the extra weight in his spacecraft, leaving it abandoned on Mars. It was just a painful reminder of how people tend to leave mess no matter where they go, as long as it's for their own sake.All in all, an incredibly superficial and sad movie. I'd have appreciated to have at least one skeptical character in it."
233," Awesome movie
","I watch a lot of movies. And when I say ""a lot"" I mean it. This movie just went through the ceiling of my ""great movies list"". This is what a drama-comedy movie should be like, a bit of both emotions. I read the book and was amazed by how well written and specific it was, especially if you consider the fact that this was the first novel of Andy Weir (the author of the book), the movie doesn't explain every single thing but still makes sure the viewer can understand what is going on. Also, Matt Damon's performance in this is incredible, he was born to play Mark Watney. And not just him, Chiwetel Ejiofor as Vincent Kapoor and the whole cast was great. Basically, what I'm saying is go see this movie, you won't regret it."

235," Realistic NASA propaganda
","Talking about a realistic film...When a mission in Mars goes wrong, the astronaut crew hurriedly departs from the planet. A crew member (Mark Watney, played by Matt Damon) has an accident and is left behind. He is presumed dead by everyone. NASA issues a statement about it, while the crew is on its way back. Everything's OK up to this point.When it is revealed to NASA that Mark Watney is alive, the organization has two options: 1) Let the world know they mistakenly left an astronaut alone in Mars (gain bad publicity) and be forced to launch a multimillion rescue mission with high probability of failure (NASA's budget and reputation at stake). And all these, just for one man.2) Silence the employee's who know about it (by any means possible) and let Mark Watney die. Nobody will ever know, hence NASA doesn't get bad publicity and saves hundred millions of dollars (to say the least).Guess what... They went for #1! And the Chinese helped them too! Now, this is what I call PROPAGANDA.In addition, the film suffers from an extremely bad sense of humour. I honestly found the ""disco"" cue pathetic, but I guess it's a matter of personal taste.Don't get me wrong, I actually enjoyed this movie. It has great cinematography (not Interstellar standards but still commendable) and overall it is good fun, but obviously it can't be taken seriously."
236," It was good, but it wasn't anything new.
","I enjoyed this movie, but I didn't love it, not like I loved Gravity. That doesn't go to say though that the acting wasn't amazing, the science wasn't well thought out and the graphics and CGI weren't all very well done, because they were!I think what was missing for me was that complete sense of loneliness and that eerie feeling that I feel being alone on a massive planet, with barely any communication with anyone, and no life besides him and his crops, honestly, that part could have been done better. Think about it, how damn scary would that be, knowing that you won't see anyone or talk to anyone in many many years. I know I would feel pretty scared.It was a great movie though, and I assume it will be up for some awards. I recommend seeing it at the movies so you can get that atmosphere from watching it on the big screen, and when a movie with space is involved I always recommend seeing it at the movies as it creates that whole sense of a large space, a very large space.Most viewers will love it! Matt Damon was amazing as per usual and it's worth a watch."
237," I actually liked it (SPOILERS)
","The Martian to me is another Hollywood, overcoming all odds, feel good movie, the science isn't exactly at the top of the list and this can be seen (if you know Mars weather patterns) straight from the off ,fortunately for the viewer the suspension of belief is rewarded with some amazing views of the red planet and some actual real life science and applications that could really work on mars. Matt Damon does a pretty solid Job as Mark Watney and I did actually feel myself routing for the character so in my opinion if you wanna go watch a pretty good sci fi movie with no real antagonists that has top notch shots of space and mars and spaceships with no aliens or weird stuff or mind boggling equations etc then watch this if not go watch Interstellar or Contact either way I prefer this a lot more than both them and I thought they were good ."
238," overall enjoyable .. although i kept thinking how much better it could have easily been
","The premise had all the ingredients for a great movie. Unfortunately Scott only did a C+ job with it.What was good in the movie was Matt Damon. His was the standout performance and is the sole reason for coming away with a somewhat positive rating. Just about all his scenes (except the last bullshit rendezvous) had me interested.What was bad was plenty: Every other character was uninspiring. The schmaltzy ending was nauseating and unnecessary. There was too much scientifically impossible stuff (just as unnecessary). And the slingshot ""breakthrough"" that a 20-year old geek had was an insult to the basic laws of physics that have been in play since space travel began. What I really missed was having a longer, slower ""tour"" of Mars and the space between our planets. This part of it felt overlooked.We could have had something quite profound, but it was ruined by pandering to the lowest-common Hollywood film-goer. I guess deep-and- meaningful doesn't sell .. and we have the many moriferons out there to thank for it. Shame."
239," Ridleys Redemption
","Despite some recent missteps Ridley Scott will always be one of my all time favourite directors and The Martian just further solidifies this for me because I believe this stands up there with Gladiator and Blade Runner as his best and was my favourite movie of 2015. Matt Damon is incredible in this movie with out a doubt the best performance in a Ridley Scott movie since Russell Crowe in Gladiator and in my opinion should have took home the Oscar for this movie he's amazing with the comedy and the emotion the little moments where his armour starts to crack no you think he wants to give up but he never does, that's what makes Mark Watney such a great protagonist he's easy to get behind and never bores the audience. While nobody steals the spotlight from Damon, Chiwetel Ejiofor and Jessica Chastain both hold their own in supporting roles they're more than able to keep the audience invested while we're not on Mars. Speaking of the Red Planet it looks incredible, life like even. You truly care about Mark Witney getting home because you realise how hard he is fighting to survive every time he succeeds you hope it last but quickly realise that it won't and that makes for some truly heartbreaking scenes. The special effects are also amazing in this film their not overused their used sparingly only to advance the plot and put you more into the situation. The arc on earth, while definitely not as interesting as Mars, is still great to watch your behind them 100% to succeed and you truly believe that everyone is important in the rescue mission and that nobody is expendable and with a cast this big that is truly impressive. The Martian is a masterpiece it's got amazing performances, direction and production design it's a perfectly balanced movie that never leaves you bored and leaves me hoping that Ridley Scott will keep that up. A+/100%"
240," The unbreakable American spirit colonizes Mars against all odds
","This is not a movie about a stranded guy on Mars. It's a movie about an American guy left stranded on Mars. It's not a movie the explorers true emotions in a guy completely lost in outer space. It 's a movie that shows, and salutes, high spirit and an ability to take everything with a toothpaste smile in the darkest circumstances. Its not a movie that surprises you in any way. It's a movie that tries to surprise you so much that you pretty quickly understand that this will be a consistent pattern throughout the movie.My hope was to get inside the mind of a guy left alone from earth, totally alienated, and with a challenge to sustain himself with food in a race against time. Nothing more.It doesn't show any significant amount of doubt or fear but instead it shows scenes with action again and again which eliminates any chance of connecting with the story in any empathic way.And on top of the cake you had the whole stereotype team spirit with his crew and NASA and yes, the whole American nation. One big happy family...../SimonPs. When you read reviews that gives max score check to see if the user has made more than one review. If not consider the possibility of a lobbyist.

241," Diamond in the rough...
","The Martian is one of those films that we've grown to be accustomed to; an interesting premise, good cast and promising plot with a lot of potential but that fails at delivery. The Martian is like a great business idea that fails to meet practicality. The Martian is like stolen intellectual property whereby the culprit finally realizes he doesn't really know how to make it productive. The Martian is like having a magic wand and not knowing what to do with it.An astronaut is left for dead by his crew on a desolate hostile planet 50 million kilometers from Earth after a violent storm having only a few days' supply of food, water and oxygen. Any emergency rescue mission to the planet, Mars, to save him would still take 4 years to arrive. He is alone. He cannot communicate with Earth or members of his crew who are now half way through their journey back home, believing him to be dead. Interesting premise isn't it? Indeed, until you see what the storyline does to it.Here is a cheery Mark Watney (Matt Damon) who learns of his fate and his response is a few lame jokes directed at a camcorder where he practically gives the audience fun facts about Mars, science and Botany. He keeps talking while constantly nibbling on God-knows-what, which was quite annoying IMO, jokes non-stop about the bad disco music that his mission commander left and practically enjoys his solo stay on Mars. Not the reaction one would expect, eh? I guess being stranded alone on planet Mars with 68 sols' (Mars days) provision of food and water isn't such a bummer after all. Mark's attitude toward his situation is as if he merely just woke up and found he had the whole house to himself so he does the Salsa across the living room in his drawers and showers without the curtains.We expect a lot of tension, drama, panic attacks, agoraphobia, loneliness, fear, hopelessness, bouts of insanitybut no; Mark Watney is quite content with his situation. He might as well build a golf course with all his Botany ingenuity and/or a Holiday Inn. Mark solves every problem one by one as they come to him. Basically nothing bad happens to him. At least HE has a magic wand and he knows how to use it.The story itself is not very realistic. When the director of NASA learns that the Chinese have agreed to lend them a spacecraft that they've been building in secret to save a man they couldn't care less about, his response over the phone (with the director of the Chinese space agency) is ""oh okay, I understand. Thank you"" then hangs up and says ""yes!"" Like a high school kid whose crush just accepted to be his prom date. He might as well have said ""Oh okay, I understand. Thank you, by the way what music are you currently listening to? Have you tried our Justin Bieber?"" We are also told that messages between Earth and Mars have a 30 minute delay but when Mark Watney finally finds a way to communicate with NASA, the conversations go so smoothly it could have been via KIK or IM.Matt Damon himself was good but he clearly didn't take the role too seriously. The fact that they had to use a body double to show his weight loss gives an idea of the amount of dedication he gave to the film. Recall what Christian Bale did for The Machinist? And he wasn't even stranded on a planet 100 million miles away; he lived across from a Chick-fil-A and Pizza Hut.SPOILER ALERT. If you haven't watched the movie this is where you should stop reading this review.The ending of the film could very well be the most disappointing part. I comforted myself after the lack of drama with the thought that in the end, when Mark Watney is supposed to leap from his spacecraft towards the returned crew in the vastness of space, all the tension would pour in. It does not. He might as well have gotten to them on a hoverboard with both hands in his pockets. Mark is really one lucky bastard huh?The Martian is a visual spectacle with very believable Martian landscape, space exploration apparatus and (not so) believable space science, but sadly that is all. It fails to explore all possibilities that the premise offers and instead relies on fratboy humor the likes of ""my balls are frozen!"" and ""take that, Neil Armstrong!"" It is a film about the psychological effects of being stranded alone on an unfriendly planet zillions of miles from home, but it hardly shows any. I didn't hate the movie, nor do I advise not to see it, but I didn't love it either even though it is signed by the great Ridley Scott. It won't be registered as a classic but it'll surely seduce The Academy who are too often impressed with high production value, familiar leading heads and unnecessarily long running yarns."
242," Like everyone else has already said...it's Scott's best in a few years now.
","""The Martian"": This was one I wanted to see in the theater because I'm a pretty big Ridley Scott fan, unfortunately never got the opportunity; like most people who got into sci-fi, I can thank Scott for that since he's contributed so much to the genre. I won't claim that this movie is his next big contribution to the sci-fi genre that will change things forever like his past films ""Alien"" and ""Blade Runner"", but this is pretty good. I thought that this was a good time, I don't know if it needed to be two and a half hours long; when it comes to the length of a movie I would kind of prefer that if a science fiction flick has a runtime over two hours long that it be a little more innovative or provocative than something like this, but it was consistently entertaining so I can totally give it a pass for that.I don't really want to get much into the story because the plot is pretty simple, rather not spoil what happens. If you have seen the trailers then it's pretty easy to gather what the movie is about; Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is stranded on Mars with very limited amounts of food and somehow has to find ways to survive alone with all these extreme scenarios happening to him until a rescue team hopefully makes it to him in time. This isn't Scott's typical dark sci-fi film though; I mean yes, you can tell he's in the director's chair but this is a bit brighter and a lot more of an optimistic film in comparison to the rest of his filmography. I say more optimistic because the lead character that is stuck on Mars, Mark Watney, stays completely positive for most of the obstacles that come. He does have his occasional moments of despair and even anger, but he keeps his chin up so he can solve the problem and move on so he can survive. It would be so easy to make this character such a downer; not doing much except brooding, which is understandable for the awful situation dealt to this character, but they don't do that and it makes this character a bit of a stand out and more interesting. Makes me like the character easier than if the writing had gone the other route to darken up his character instead because of how his whole being stranded situation starts almost from the very beginning. If he wasn't as likable as he was, then this movie could have been a long drag to watch someone to brood instead of being proactive like he ended up being. Not much else to say really; the acting was really good, the writing was solid, the direction and cinematography were of course great and I was entertained and invested the whole time. I liked it. I don't know if I would say ""best of the year"" like it seems some of the nominations from the various award ceremonies this year are announcing, but I still think it was a really good movie. This was a movie about hope, keeping a positive attitude in harsh times and being as proactive as humanly possiblethis was the anti-""War Room"" movie. If you've seen ""War Room"" then you might know what I'm talking about here, just think about it for a second. ""War Room"" when things get tough it tells you to sit in a closet, don't do anything productive except submit to your verbally abusive husband and pray about him because God will step in to take all of your problems away. Here, he doesn't just sit and wait for something hopefully good to happen or for NASA to rectify the situation. He does what he can, almost right away, to survive and improve on his bad situation. I know they are completely different scenarios, but the message is still the same. Do something yourself if you want things to change for the better, don't expect others to always do it for you. So go see this movie, it is pretty friggin' good!"
243," Great movie, definitely recommended.
","This movie is amazing. In case you don't know what it's about here's a quick rundown: It's about a man named Mark Watney (Matt Damon) who through a series of events is left on Mars, but that's just what the trailer will tell you. This movie obviously had the opportunity to be heartbreakingly sad ""A treacherous tale about a young man abandoned on the red planet"" but it's not. It's actually surprisingly funny. Mark Watney manages to find the humor in the situations. This movie is funny when it wants to be, sad when it wants to be, and breathtaking when it wants to be. It's all of the things you want a movie to be. I would definitely recommend this film."
244," Unnecessary Foul Language-I'd rather watch robots than Matt Damon
","Hollywood is now using F Bombs in P-13 movies? All the kids watching this for the science angle will be punished with bad language. It used to be there were no atheists in Fox Holes. Apparently they all went to NASA. If I was stranded on Mars I'd be making all kinds of deals with G_d. They were afraid to Disney-ize the movie, so they took Castaway and improved it, but with no real oomf. Consequently the movie comes up as cold as the potatoes after the HAB blowout. But what else should we expect from Matt Damon? Isn't his cold detachment what made Bourne so believable?The Chinese angle was funny too, because at one point the media coverage describes the joint effort as the rebirth of the American Space program, which we know was saved by the generosity of the Chinese. I'm not sure if this was intentional or an oversight, but it seems like a loose end.I did like this better than Gravity, which should have negative stars for a rating, but this is no where near Interstellar. Seems like Hollywood is having trouble coming up with good space movies while the visual side of the business is fantastic. Maybe Hollywood should forget the Human Robots like Matt Damon and just use real robots or Androids? Time to start remaking Phillip K Dick stories/movies?"
245," The Best Movie I have Seen in a Long Time
","""The Martian"" kept us on the edge our seats the entire time; both with the tension and just sheer delight of this movie and storyline. I can't understand the reviewers who stated that they felt the movie lacked emotion or those who faulted numerous science situations in the story (excluding the sand storm premise).Regarding emotional and the human element in the film, I think it was very well acted and various strong emotions were all through the film constantly demonstrated by Mark, his crew and the NASA staff. However, it's possible that the reviewers didn't see a reaction like they would have had under the same circumstances. What should be kept in mind is that astronauts are extremely well trained people, they are also literally selected for resiliency, adaptability, curiosity, ability to trust (including yourself) and creativity/resourcefulness. Mental toughness and flexibility is very desired in an astronaut; so although Mark had phases of fear, frustration, anger and depression, he quickly refocused his mind on the most important problem at the time. As he said ""You solve one problem and you solve the next one, and then the next."" For anyone who works (or knows someone who works) in a career with constant problem solving (first responders, ER, most STEM careers, etc) this is the way one thinks and works; deal with the biggest problem first, them move onto the next and the next and the next. As Adam Savage from ""Myth Buster's"" has said ""calm people live"", so with all his training, Mark would know how to handle a crisis without freaking out. In contrast Tom Hank's character Chuck Noland, the FedEx operations executive stranded in ""Cast Away"", was more of an everyman than Astronaut Mark Watney; and thus Mark had a more controlled reaction to things.As for the science situations, most people are aware the premise of the story, how Mark gets stranded and injured, is not correct for the environment of Mars. However beyond the premise, most science is pretty sound. I watch numerous videos about the science behind ""The Martian"" and the only other thing mentioned as inaccurate was that on Mars the Astronauts would bounce more in their planetary walking, and they would also likely have heavier suits. Due to some director's choices and limitations, Ridley Scott made the decision to bypass these details. Otherwise, what I have found is that Mark might have been pretty lucky but that the Science was pretty good in the movie and better in the book. I suggest everyone review a few Youtube videos on the Science of ""The Martian"" as it's some pretty interesting stuff. The movie put the Science back in Sci Fi and addition made Science cool. The movie shows intelligent men and women solving problem and there is no real 'bad guy', just Mars, which doesn't cooperate well (as Mark says). I you like the scene in ""Apollo 13"" where the engineering team quickly invents a way to make the Command Module's square filters work in the Lunar Module's round receptacles, you'll probably enjoy ""The Martian"". ""The Martian"" is the best movie I've seen in a long time and it was exciting from beginning to end, despite the fact I figured I knew the story from the previews. It's nice to see intelligent men and women working together for a common goal and using Science to triumph over major obstacles."
246," Scott and Damon Give Mars Back Its Good Name
","Ridley Scott has given us some of the best films ever, tackling every genre from romance to Science Fiction. We will never be able to see Science Fiction the same way after ""Alien"", which blends horror, science, and drama so well that people are still studying the film. Hearts stopped as both technology and outer space biology gave us the best monsters of the 70's. He went on to improve on ""2001"" by taking the mind of artificial intelligence and have them play God. Here, he goes back to the resilience of humans, and with a bit of humour, plenty of heart, and a very intelligent marriage of old fashioned story telling and much respect for the promising future of space travel, he gives us a new cinematic gem.""The Martian"" creates a universe where a human learns to use his resources to overcome adversity and very unlucky night when he's left behind by his crew. He must find ways to survive, to let the rest of the universe, especially Earth, know that he's alive, but that also means that they must find a way to get him back and save face while dealing with politics, the limits of contemporary space science, and the ability to make a film that refrains from relying too much on special effects, but which has its feet strongly planted on common sense and realism.Damon is wonderful as the man who keeps up his spirits and uses every bit of knowledge to keep going. His acting hasn't been this good since he gave us the dark leech in ""Ripley"". Here he has a heart, a brain, and plenty of courage as he faces every possible obstacle that he faces. Unlike other films out there where knives have suddenly become less lethal than before, this man is threatened by equipment that pierces his suit and his abdomen, which makes him cringe and shudder with pain and whose body shrivels as he is running out of food. There's a terrific scene where his eyes sink in despair as he is confronted with the loss of his garden, something that signifies his imminent death. He's no superman, just a regular human being who fights to keep both his body and spirit alive.Almost as good as Damon are the rest of the supporting cast, which work each role to find options to bring him back to Earth. ""Gravity"" gave us plenty of thrills and emotions. Things are subdued most of the time here, but the climax is proof that people like Scott are able to use the best of what is available to them and give us quality film making. We are soon joining the rest of the human community, cheering, holding our breath, wringing our hands as we await for his success. ""Argo"" gave us a taste of what a good old fashioned crowd pleaser can do. ""The Martian"" takes it even higher because we get to bond and identify with this ""Martian"" who happens to be the best scientist on that planet.Funny, exciting, rewarding, intelligent, and perfectly directed, just the way movies used to be, should be, and hopefully will be in the future.Thanks Mr. Scott."
247," A movie about some astro guy cracking jokes
","I've read the book and it's indeed not about a poor, lonely soul lost on Mars, who becomes a philosopher about death and life and is fighting depressions all the time, only getting some kind of inner relief at the end. It is not like Cast Away"" with Tom Hanks nor anything like Interstellar"" which has a whole different story.It's about high tech and science, it's about a tough astronaut whose only goal is to solve the next problem, who is absolutely focusing on solutions to survive as long as he can. There are moments where he is hapless and desperate but he's got a kind of stubbornness, a special kind of will to survive that drives him through this misery. He jokes, he thinks of trivial stuff that helps him keeping his mind intact. You could say he actually denies in some way that he's the only guy on an entire planet millions of miles away from home. But the situation forces him to fight against physics and technology all the time, he just has got no time to think about to much.What you get as the reader then is a spectacular story of how he manages it – against all odds. With his sheer will, his unique personality, the training and knowledge and with the help of smart, brave and very noble people. This makes this story indeed look very positive in the outcome, it describes an almost impossible effort and shows – so do I think personally – the best of us as human beings. Mark Watney survives – with luck, of course, but mainly because neither he ever gave up nor the people on earth. The climax in this plot was the most thrilling thing I've read for years. I had to shed a tear, it just blew my mind. At the end everything went to an extreme fight humans versus the universe"" which will be won by incredible smartness, braveness and by big pumping hearts in the breasts of the protagonists. In the aftermath I think it's even more than just another survival story"", it's about how far we went and how clever we've become in the great struggle of life, especially if you don't forget how much obstacles we are still throwing in our own way. It's a very utopian view, yes, but one who touches your heart if you have one.The movie captured only a tiny fraction of this, unfortunately. It's a funny movie about some astro guy cracking jokes on a funky planet not far away, uhm, and some of his buddies, who help him out. Of course he survives, what else. It's Matt Damon, our hero. No explanations needed, it's all good. Thank you for watching."
248," The Martian
","One of the most commercialized films this year. I saw adverts almost every day, with Matt Damon's face on the red double decker buses and amazing pictures of Jordan (which is supposed to be the planet Mars in the film) Because of that, I only wanted to see the movie even more. I was anticipating the day it would open in the nearest cinema. I am not the biggest fan of 3D movies, but this one was different. It feels like it demanded 3D. And probably, for the first time, I enjoyed a film in 3D. The scenes on Mars and in space are impeccably shot. Wouldn't expect nothing less from Ridley Scott. Those shots are pure art, a feast for your eyes. As for the story, it may not be that creative, but Matt Damon was unexpectedly funny and I laughed much more than I thought I would in such a movie. The script is well written. I spotted a few mistakes in the storyline, but they weren't that major. If the lead actor wasn't Damon, I don't know if the film would be as good, because it is hard for only one actor to carry the entire story. Film is about survival and never giving up, no matter what. It sends a powerful message. The thing I find strangest is that I heard many people ask if it was a true story. I hope after watching it, people will study Mars a bit and see that, unfortunately, we haven't been there yet. The thing that bothered me most was the fact Damon's crew members lacked enthusiasm and their reactions should have been more natural and enhanced. I gave it a solid eight. Enjoyable film. A good watch, definitely."
249," nothing new
","as most of sci-fi fans I admire Ridley Scott, as director of Alien, I love Gladiator, and even with not very well rated Prometheus, I still give him a chance to direct it's sequel, but this movie is an other story. From trailers probably you already know that this movie is about astronaut (Matt Damon) stuck on the Mars, and team is sent there to rescue him. Thing is you probably expect plot twist, villains, unexpected moments, unresolved problems, sacrificing lives, do you want to hear which from this things happen? None of them! even in Disney films are more tension, I think we can't avoid comparing this film to Gravity and Interstellar, both are 10 times better than this. Everybody is sweet guy doing their job, and everybody will live happily after... In conclusion save ticket money and go see another movie... you calmly wait for this movie in TV or buy DVD at last..."
250," The film was so monotonous....
","The Martian is seriously the most boring sci-fi film I have ever witnessed. From start to finish, it felt like I was watching a university speech from a teacher for 2 hours. There was nothing interesting about this film, other than it was done in space. The visual effects are fantastic but the acting and the scenes were just dull, joyless and slow. In fact, my friend got me a extra pillow in case I needed it if the film was boring and boy, I was lucky to have that comfy pillow. This film may get the attention of sci-fi lovers but it will certainly not get the attention of those who find sci-fi films extremely boring, Interstellar was way better than this, even though it was a 2 hrs and 40 minutes film. It had no action which I thought was horrific. Do not watch this film unless you plan on bringing a pillow and a blanket"
251," Underwhelming
","Seemed more like a NASA public relations film. How we are supposed to think NASA would react to a lost being. As if!No excitement, no real psychological drama, in fact I've seen more problem/solution and emotional rollercoasters in prison solitary.Disappointing cos I was looking forward to this film and getting lost in the atmosphere, instead I've been fighting off getting lost in sleep.Cant remember the name of the other space film recently with cloonz in it? That had far more drama and special effects I thought.If you've got 2 hrs before bed and are knackered, watch this cos it wont matter if you nod off for an hr half way through"
252," The Martian
","First Saving Private Ryan, then Interstellar, and now The Martian. Matt Damon's the one to find. The go to guy. The one worthy of being found thrice over. Damon is Watney, a man stranded on Mars after his crew believe him dead. This film is about his survival. Suspension of disbelief is steady and highly believable, to the point of utter astonishment. It's incredible how Watney's time spent on Mars feels so real. No one has landed on Mars before, and no one probably will in our lifetime. Ridley Scott and the team behind The Martian have kept the physics clean. Watney painfully produces food and water for the long haul. Damon is mesmerising. Open spaces and long/wide angle shots create a feeling of solitude. He's supported by the likes of Sean Bean and Chiwetel Ejiofor, but when the screen's off Damon, it needs to be. We need to know how and what he's doing. Visually stunning effects add a balance of beauty and ambiance. The contrast is definitely felt between Watney on Mars, his crew on their ship back home and the NASA workers on Earth. The Martian is a gripping blockbuster, even if it's a wee bit predictable."
253," Lacks all the tension and emotion of the book.
","This from the man that gave us Alien, Blade Runner, Black Hawk Down? Utterly devoid of tension or any real emotion from the one dimensional characters, this plays like a bullet-point list of ""things that happened in the story"". Another good book ransacked for events and bunged on-screen. I must add another five lines of text in order to get this review accepted for some reason, but really there isn't much more to say about it. The 3D was curiously flattened, the landscapes appearing like cardboard cut-out mountains. The rest looked OK I guess, but so does any film these days. Almost complete lack of science was a let-down too. Very disappointed."
254," Amazing!! Destined to be one of the best space movies ever made!!!!
","This movie rocked the house!! What can I say? The only movie I truly was astonished by this year was Ant-Man, and this one is up there with one of the best movies of the year. I recently saw Hotel Transylvania 2, and while the animation was imaginative and there were some really funny scenes, I kind of thought, ""eh, it's not bad, just so much potential wasted"". With The Martian, the potential is realized and fulfilled, and a whole lot more added to that. The main surprise in this movie is the fact that it has more optimism than any other thriller I've seen-and I love it when movies strive to avoid predictability in emotion of the characters. Matt Damon was excellent in this because of his huge amount of likability and charms, but was frightened and tense when he needed to be. Jeff Daniels is definitely the best performance of the movie other than Damon in my opinion. I saw the 3D screening of this movie and the opening scene and the vistas of Mars landscapes and planet overviews immersed me into the intensity of the suspense shown. Awesome 70s soundtrack. I'd recommend this piece of art to any movie buff, Ridley Scott fan, or space movie fan any day. Definitely a Blu-ray collection addition in my book."
255," One of the year's best (and smartest) movies.
","THE MARTIAN (2015) **** Matt Damon, Jessica Chastain, Jeff Daniels, Michael Pena, Sean Bean, Kristen Wiig, Kate Mara, Sebastian Stan, Aksel Hennie, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Benedict Wong, Mackenzie Davis, Donald Glover. Epic, fun and enthralling science fiction drama with Damon as a botanist left behind on Mars accidentally being believed to be killed on an expedition, resulting in his savvy brain trust (his and NASA's) to get him home in spite of tremendous odds, obstacles and pitfalls. Ridley Scott pulls out all the stops with brio and smartly sprinkles in dollops of self-ware, world-weary humor (thanks to a fine adaptation of Andy Weir's book by Drew Goddard) and a sterling cast including bright-eyed Chastain as his commander hell-bent on the rescue mission, Ejiofor and Daniels as squabbling team pundits and again, Damon in a career high turn as the self-possessed yet vulnerable Mark Watney in a performance ranking up there with Tom Hanks' in CASTAWAY & Sandra Bullock's in GRAVITY ; in other words - Oscar-worthy. A must see in 3-D with some truly amazing visuals and a superb sound track of '70s disco tunes. One of the year's best (and smartest) movies."
256," Another masterpiece from Ridley Scott
","First of all,the review is spoiler free so feel free to read it if you haven't seen the movie yet.Firstly,the cast. They are all excellent and experienced actors and actresses and they did their job on the level that it should be done.Starting with Matt Damon who plays astronaut Mark Watney.His acting ability is great and he made 100% effort to role.Certainly one of his best roles. Jessica Chastain plays the role of mission commander Melissa Lewis,which suits her just fine,knowing that she has experience with movies about space.She played in the Interstellar last year which was one of the best movie of the year. Not to mention Sean Bean,who is absolutely amazing and most likely one of the best actors in Hollywood.Although he plays a minor role in this movie that hasn't stopped him to act so well. One of the biggest pluses in the movie is surly acting. A bit about the plot(without spoiling anything),most of the time atmosphere is very intense and serious,but there are several scenes with good sense of humor which helps the viewers to relax after very intense scene.Visual effects and CGI. Mars looks as it should look because of all the CGI effects of the place where movie was shoot and it is really nice to see,especially in 4K resolution and 3D technology.All rocket launches,explosions and martian storms are done perfectly.It really makes you feel they're real.In conclusion this is definitely Oscar worth movie and one of the best movies of the year,if not the best.Space fanatics(like me) will enjoy the movie all the time and will feel the tension as it is supposed to be felt.If anyone thinks they won't understand a single word in the movie,I can tell they're wrong.The movie is made for everyone,children,teenagers,adults and scientists so everyone will be able to understand what're they talking about."
257," Excellent !!!! holds your attention from start to finish.
","Wonderful photography, incredible Matt Damon acting.This film makes us think how difficult and same time possible the colonization of other planets, and how the water discovery would make much difference. It is a film that holds your attention from start to finish.Ridley Scott has changed a lot the climate of this space movie, does not follow his classic style, it is not dark and do not have much suspense, if any, the film is quite optimistic, the difficulties encountered by the characters are very realistic and plausible solutions, reaches one point that we feel it in mars along with them and that it is not so much difficult than an underwater exploration or climb mount everest.In my opinion the only weak point of the film is the speed of the progress in the third act, it is very fast, losing the pace."
258," A Solid Watch!
","Based on Andy Weir's 2011 novel by the same name, 'The Martian' is an Epic Sci-Fi Adventure, that offers solid entertainment. Its a gripping film, about about survival & hope. Legendary Director Sir Ridley Scott & Actors Matt Damon & Jeff Daniels are at their finest!'The Martian' Synopsis: During a manned mission to Mars, Astronaut Mark Watney is presumed dead after a fierce storm and left behind by his crew. But Watney has survived and finds himself stranded and alone on the hostile planet. With only meager supplies, he must draw upon his ingenuity, wit and spirit to subsist and find a way to signal to Earth that he is alive.'The Martian' is about human willpower. If one has the courage & belief, He/She can conquer any difficulty, even if its beyond planet Earth. Mark Watney (Played by Matt Damon) is a fine, fine protagonist, who's spirit to survive & fight against all odds, makes his unbelievable journey, all the more engrossing. You are with him throughout the turbulence & you never stop rooting for him.Drew Goddard's Adapted Screenplay is top-notch. Its a challenging, inspiring & throughly entertaining Story, that hardly misses a beat. I was glued to the screen from start to finish. Sir Ridley Scott's Direction is exemplary. 'The Martian' is among his best works, as the Master Storyteller handles the intensity, with precision. Dariusz Wolski's Cinematography is perfect. Pietro Scalia's Editing is razor-crisp, despite a running-time of over 140-minutes! Art & Costume Design are excellent. Graphics & 3D Effects are top-class. Harry Gregson-Williams's Score is soulful. Performance-Wise: Matt Damon is at his peak here. Emboding Mark Watney from head to toe, he leads the narrative with a forceful performance. He gives us a protagonist, we'd like to remember for a long time. Supporting him superbly back home is Jeff Daniels as Teddy Sanders, head of NASA. He's flawless. Of the rest, Chiwetel Ejiofor as Vincent Kapoor, a NASA mission director, Kristen Wiig as Annie Montrose, NASA spokesperson, Jessica Chastain as Melissa Lewis, Ares III commander, Kate Mara as Beth Johanssen, an astronaut & Sean Bean as Mitch Henderson, a NASA mission director, leave a strong impression.On the whole, 'The Martian' is a ride that needs to be experienced! Strongly Recommended!"
259," A potential Sci-Fi epic with emotional links to the past
","Firstly, I must say that I enjoyed this movie on its own merits and thought the science was adequately explained and believable for all but the most nit-picking nerds and idiots who don't realise that, by definition, science fiction is still fiction! The cinematography was well done and the pacing was good. Damon plays the part of the marooned astronaut well, adding a typical astronaut/pilot get-it-done practicality to the natural circumstantial fear and frustration. I felt that the portrayal of the reactions of the NASA management and Houston technical members was excellent, reflecting the reality of the publicly funded and politically vulnerable agency. My only dis-satisfaction with the film is that I felt the epilogue section after the rescue was unnecessary and detracted from the dramatic impact, which the film-makers had successfully imparted at that point. If it were not for those end sequences I think this movie could have joined the ranks of great movies like 'The Right Stuff' and 'Apollo 13' as a classic favourite of aviation/space enthusiasts like me.I appreciated the film even more though on a more personal level, as I am old enough to remember well the Apollo era; particularly the gut-wrenching wait as I and virtually the whole world held our collective breaths as the tense and potentially tragic drama of Apollo 13 unfolded. To this day those involved in the space program maintain a reverence for those who have gone before and especially those who have given their lives and to me this film celebrates that type of attitude and culture.This film references past history, books and films very well too. I loved the Hermes crew's description of the astrophysicist as a 'steely-eyed missile man'. In short, I recommend this movie for any enthusiasts of aviation and the space programme, anyone who enjoys quality sci-fi movies and anyone who enjoys a good but simple tale of triumph over adversity. I therefore do not recommend this film for armchair geek-critics who think the only quality needed for a good movie is perfect scientific exactitude.Oh, and by the way... For all you moronic scientist wannabes, humans actually DO exhale oxygen in significant quantities. Each breath taken only utilises only a small proportion of the O2 available before the remainder is exhaled, along with the CO2 and other unused components. Criticism of this as a supposed scientific 'flaw' in the film illustrates only your own ignorance and inability to research the facts before bursting forth into factually defective, self-important bluster. The dynamics and physics of space travel were also pretty accurate, despite what some 'reviewers' suggest."
260," A comeback for Ridley Scott
","The Martian was directed by Ridley Scott and stars Matt Damon,Jessica Chastain, Jeff Daniels,Kate Mara. First off, I've readied the book before seeing the movie so I had high hopes going into it and I have to say I was not disappointed. The Martian wasn't only a great movie but a great come back from Ridley Scott. He did a fantastic job and handled the big cast great. His last few movie had a big cast too and those movie turned out pretty bad. This wasn't the case, the acting, cinematography, everything was great. You would think a man by himself on a planet would get boring but it didn't at all. Matt Damon played the role of Mark Watney fantastic. Seeing this person surviving was so interesting and at times very funny. Just like the book there's lot humor and it works well. Jeff Daniels did a great job also, he's be doing a lot of movies this year that might get him best supporting actor. Overall was a great movie and a great comeback for amazing director Ridley Scott. Every thing was done right. If your a fan of the book or just trying to see a great book see the Martian in theaters."
261," solid entertainment but nothing really exceptional
","The audience wasn't bored despite the running time, and Matt Damon does a really good job of holding everybody in just the right amount of tension, but the whole thing is too calculated and manipulative and, like most of Ridley Scott's output, looks like an advertisement. In this case, it's a big propaganda advertisement for the American and Chinese space programs and for various corporations that get prominent screen space -- who wants to bet me that the big ""Forever 21"" logo that looms over half the screen towards the film's climax looks just as stupid as the the bit TDK neon sign at the end of ""Blade Runner""?It was one of those movies I walked out of with a good feeling, but the bad taste spreads the longer that it sits in my stomach. It's almost too cute, how Matt Damon's character makes these witty statements every 10 minutes or so, and the disco music and all of it. ""I will survive!"" The world is sure ready to put a lot of effort into saving a single white man sitting on some damn planet he has no business being on in the first place. He even brags about being the first colonizer! This movie will really be hilarious to watch in 2040, I'm telling you!But it wasn't too bad to watch in 2015 with a nice date and a good crowd of people either. Hard to hate it, but impossible for me to love it. Every time I was hoping for a good idea, it delivered sentiment or sardonic wit. At first I was into the way the movie raised intelligence and science up as virtues. But when Matt Damon gets up at the end to deliver a soliloquy about how science can deliver human beings from any problem..... you have to wonder why we can't spend some small part of the energy that we would spend to bring an astronaut home from Mars to, I dunno, save a child from slavery in a mine or a textile factory in the ""third world."" And, yeah, I'm pretty sure Matt Damon wonders the same thing."
262," The Martian has the alright stuff. However, this movie didn't leave its mark on me, as it should had.
","I know, a lot of people love this science-fiction film based on Andrew Weir's novel of the same name. However this film about an astronaut, Mark Whatney (Matt Damon) being stuck on Mars after a botch mission was just meh to me. Don't get me wrong, I like the film about a man trying to science, the sh*t out of his dilemma in order to survive, yet I can't overlook the film's large jarring blemishes. First off, in comparison to director Ridley Scott's other stabs at Science Fiction, The Martian is considerably more cheery and upbeat than those other films. This overbearing optimistic tone to the film, kinda hurts the film, a bit, because it rarely allows the movie to very suspenseful or intense. Its way, too one-sided idealism. You rarely see the main character remoted any other, type of an emotional, besides his happy go lucky/problem solving persona. I know, astronauts are supposed to be brave, but gees, this man is not realistic at all. The movie doesn't really explore, the depth of his personality, much. I know, very little of the man, besides that he's a botanist and a joker. You don't know, why he's so willing to survive. Does he have love-ones? Does he have big dreams, back at home? Who knows, the movie doesn't exposition that. Also, you rarely see, examples, of scenes, showing his fears and his flaws. You don't know, if this guy has a breaking point? You don't know, if the lack of food, or the pressures of living on Mars is, messing with his body & mind, because the movie never once, investigates it. The man acts the same, from beginning to end. I find the lack of emotion weight from this movie, somewhat bland. Matt Damon is a fine actor, but if he isn't given, much to work with; he comes across, as playing himself. After all, Matt Damon already had the experience of being the only living human on an uninhabitable planet. His role as Dr. Mann in 2014's Interstellar, had more complexity in his personality than this. I really, didn't see, anything in the film that felt like character development. It was, a very featureless performance. Honestly, I can see, anybody playing this character. It's not much of a stretch. I know, that sounds a bit harsh, but the emotional depth in this film is so thin. It reminds me of the Martian's surface. Where are those scenes of Mark Whatney dealing with extreme loneliness, depression, or better yet, his own morality, because it's needed, badly?! While the supporting cast is semi- strong, featuring the likes of Michael Pena, Sean Bean, Jeff Daniels, & Chiwetel Ejiofor. I didn't like, all their choices. Many of the supporting actors, are playing roles that isn't that new, to them. A Kate Mara's character always working on the computer. No surprised there. Jessica Chastain as a brilliant mathematician/semi-lead character. Saw it, already in 2014. Sean Bean's character, not dying. Never mind, that one is pretty surprising. However, bringing on so many characters with their own part to play in a very unrealistic rescue mission plan, slows things down, unlike in 1995's Apollo 13, which made a more heroic, realistic viewpoint of NASA and what really could be possible. For a movie that says, let's science the sh*t out of this! This movie's events in the terms of scientific possibility is half correct; with the other half, being close-enough. Without going into much detail, the biggest insult to science, besides the large rockets on Mars's thin surface is probably the whole 'Iron Man/bomb' maneuver. You can research, how impractical, that maneuver is, on your free time. Anyways, I really didn't like, how the movie change the ending from the book. The whole 'where are they now' epilogue was very anticlimax, when you think about it. I don't want to sound, so clichés, but sadly, in my opinion, the book's ending is a lot better than this movie. There's just so much more in the novel that is amazing, that they had to cut out for time reasons. Still, author Andy Weir very much approved of the film version. However, there were some minor nitpicking from him. Like, how he wished the movie opened up with Watney already stranded, and more exposition, toward the sciences. I have to say, the movie's visuals/special effects are breath-taking. The movie is kinda worth watching in 3D. The music is alright for the most part. Not a huge fan of Disco, but its works, within the story of the film. Harry Gregson Williams' score is also pretty impressive, with a tone that bounces between intellectual and scientific while also being hopeful and inspiring. The movie has some funny moments, so it's entertaining in that value. Check out, the Council of Elrond scene with Sean Bean for awesomeness. Also, check out the Five In-Universe style promos for the film: 'Farewell"" 'The Right Stuff', 'Our Greatest Adventure', ""Leave Your Mark"" & ""Bring Him Home'. Those are a lot of fun. Overall: Director Ridley Scott did a pretty good job, however, it's no Ron Howard's 1995's masterpiece Apollo 13. There seem to be, something missing in this triumph of science, teamwork, and the human spirit; to make me, really like it. However, if you like films like Apollo 13, Interstellar, or Gravity. I have to say, you probably would like this film. So check it out."
263," NO character arc. NO character development.
","Once upon a time, screenwriters exposed the ""inner life"" of the main characters through a thoughtful series of expository scenes in a film preceding the main storyline. In doing so, a viewer would come to an understanding of the character and developed an interest in their well-being and imminent growth.Flaws and character exposed, the screenplay would feature at its core a protagonist who struggled with obstacles to achieve a goal, and in doing so would experience quantifiable growth by the end of the screen story. This is known as a ""character arc,"" and gives a viewer a resolution in the sense that the protagonist changed for the better by the end of the film, and may very well have achieved a goal (or may not have.) This film has neither of the above and instead jumps head first into a narrative that while it is compelling, left me with little real interest in the end result of the protagonist. The story is compelling, but I found myself with a feeling genuine dissatisfaction by the end due to distinct lack of partnership with the protagonist and his struggle. If you like films based on a compelling point of departure that offer little more than production value, A-list acting talent, and special effects, then this is for you."
264," Not that great, not even good !
","after films like Gravity and Interstellar, Martian is a big downer for me.PLot: OK-ish, execution: very bad acting: OK, great actors do good acting at worst.I couldn't feel the characters or any urgency to act in tight situations. A lot of dialogues seem thrown in and out of flow. Facial expressions seem artificial. Nerds seem making an effort to look like nerds. .. Arggh!Couldn't at any point in the movie root for any character.Matt Damon tries to overdo his Serious mood and subtle humor stuff, didn't work, the background music steals the silence and lonely environment one should feel in space. well, I can rant on.. but in Short: A bad movie I regret watching."
265," The movie had ironically about as much atmosphere as the planet Mars did.
","THE MARTIAN (My Film Review) Stuck on Mars possibly forever, no biggie I guess... I was a bit disappointed, I kept wanting it to be meaningful and powerful and extraordinary... but it just wasn't... it was too calm... I felt GRAVITY in my bones... how incredible it is that we exist, and thrive... I felt her journey like the journey of birth... it moved me... I liked the scene in this movie when he looks at the first little plant he grows... but felt little else... He's just too calm and cool throughout... so I could not relate with him on a human level at all. The movie seemed to really lack depth, it didn't challenge itself or the audience... except our patience and ability to listen to bad music and hokey dialog. The idea of being the only person on a planet is compelling... I wanted more though... some human emotion... I understand he's a trained professional, but he's also a human being... and the movie lacked depth, introspection, philosophy, humanity... I enjoy the testament to human ingenuity, and the movie had its moments I really loved... a nice touch at the end seeing the little plant, the little things perhaps he used to take for granted... yes that is a good lesson. The monologue at the end makes sense, but the map is not the territory and I feel he was perfect in its execution to the point of it being detrimental to the heart of the movie. The movie had ironically about as much atmosphere as the planet Mars did. My Rating: 6/10"
266," The Most Unsatisfying SyFy Movie On This Or Any Other Planet
","As a thinking adult, I strongly felt that ""The Martian"" (with its dismal PG-13 rating) had totally short-changed me (in a big-big way) by handing me a story that was clearly meant to entertain youngsters who obviously couldn't have cared less about plot-line intelligence or coherency.(IMO) - ""The Martian's"" story-line was so predictable and so riddled with annoying cliche that I'm convinced that the only reason why Ridley Scott decided to direct this hopelessly pathetic production was to make himself a whole pile of money and the adults in the audience be damned.And, with that said - I would never, ever recommend this SyFy time-waster to anyone who I had genuine respect for. Never."
267," Laughs and survival
","Sci-fi comedic film from the director of Alien and Prometheus, Ridley Scott, and starring Matt Damon. A film about a NASA astronaut stranded in planet Mars and thrives for survival until he finds a way to contact Earth. A matter of survival and friendship. The light atmosphere of this movie makes the story as simple it can be because the space stuff is really darned complicated. It feels like the actors are really into it, hence, the acting is very effective. A movie Very entertaining. I laughed a lot of times. One of the best films of 2015. Far better than Gravity(2013).Liked it so much. A must-watch film."
268," Average in Every Way
","There is much hype around The Martian. Ridley Scott, Matt Damon and a dynamite supporting cast that features a story about a man trying to survive on Mars armed only with his intellect and will.When I heard this, I thought the picture would be similar tonally to Cast Away. An unforgiving environment, brutal conditions, desperation and watching a character grow in order to survive his ordeal.Instead, Damon is cool under fire the entire time. There is never any sense of desperation, change or arc to speak of (at least that is significant). When things go wrong, they're easily fixed and the tone of this picture is inconsistent with its scenario.Jokes abound. Whether it's from NASA on Earth, Damon's crew that left him behind or Damon himself, they just keep on rolling with what feels like a three jokes a minute standard screenplay formula in a movie about a man trapped on Mars!It just doesn't work. It's not bad. The performances are fine, Scott's direction is fine, the writing is fine and it's technically fine. But that's about it. No risks or ingenuity, no real heart or emotion. No stakes. It takes about as unique a scenario as you could conjure and makes it flat, predictable and tonally inconsistent.Humor here and there is fine, but Drew Goddard's effusive use of humor is tiresome and takes you out of the film.No characters are really developed here and you sort of just wait around for the inevitable conclusion of the picture. Maybe this would have worked better as a short.With the last two years, two incredible space pictures (especially technically speaking: Gravity and Interstellar) came out and did some bombastic things. Each had fast moving stories, top notch special effects and were unpredictable in their conclusion. They had their main characters grow and place them in diverse scenarios that kept the tension high at all times. There was a sense of danger regardless of their shortcomings (Interstellar's ending and Gravity's Sandra Bullock).In this film there's none of that. While the solutions Damon's character comes up with are smart, you don't get a dramatic sense of struggle throughout the film. Lack of struggle equals decreased tension.I'm not sure why this movie is so revered by movie goers and critics. I feel left out. Maybe it was just my expectations and wanting to see the movie I wish it could have been that left me feeling cold. Still, a tensionless film with such a good cast and crew is a terrible thing to waste.6/10- Average."
269," Average. Not worth the hype.
","First of all, the Martian was nothing like Gravity. I guess that was my biggest problem. Having loved movies like Gravity and Interstellar, this one did not come close to the performance bar let alone pass it. Everything about this movie was average. So highly disappointed with Matt Damon.1. Directing - The director worked with what he was given but there was so much more he could do. For example, there is a scene where Damon is severely undernourished and is skin and bones. His face isn't shown. The very next camera shot shows Damon 'who was supposed to be skin and bones' completely healthy and as muscular as ever. No, the space suit cannot hide a body's figure. 2. Writing - I wasn't impressed with the script. It wasn't very different but the only good thing was it was light, had a lot of humor and the story kept you going. However, every twist and plot was extremely far fetched and close to impossible. A person with common sense just sits there going ""-_- seriously? Whom are you kidding? That is so not possible!""3. Acting - The acting was top notch. I expected big things from such a promising cast and then delivered. Very pleased.4. Production design - It was brilliant. The sets, both on Mars and on earth were amazing. I was blown away. The red planet was indeed red and the equipment all looked fancy and expensive. Tick. Tick. Tick for The Martian.5. Sound - The sound track and background score was average. Neither catchy nor lethargic. Bottomline - Go watch this if you have nothing better to see. P.s. Forget watching it on the TV."
270," All hyperbole based on some facts, boring as heck
","Well R. Scott did something better than Prometheus I guess. First the name, Mark W is not a Martian, he's from earth. Next up, the sky and the clouds, no go, no such on Mars. Looks a lot like Utah.Turn around a massive spacecraft, piece of cake (not)...Chinese featured but why didn't they send a crew member or 2 to help/relieve one or 2 of NASA's crew members?Then the best of all: why have huge expensive buildings/walls/pressurized hatches when a bit of plastic from Home Depot and duct tape will keep the atmosphere and heat in? Heck I can't even do that on earth! I doubt duct tape works at -60C temperatures. So apparently all they had to do was send a bunch of North Face tents that survive fierce winds on Mt. Everest and a Tesla with some solar panels and knobby tires.Then the other Mars escape vehicle is fine and standing even though the first ARES craft couldn't stand up and almost tipped over. Gee, ever heard of support braces? A few 2X4's would have done wonders with the Home Depot order of plastic.Hey kids, space is dangerous, (final scene), gee, We needed someone who survived Mars to tell them that? Guess they haven't heard about the Internet yet?The only Mars movie that seems to be close to reality is ""Red Planet"", watch it if you can."
271," ""I'm the first person to be alone on an entire planet""
","I'd heard nothing but great things about this film beforehand. After seeing it, my verdict is ""Good, but far from great."" It certainly keeps your attention, and is an interesting mix of science fiction, survival tale, thriller-diller, and political intrigue. What it shows about NASA's dilemmas in how/when they tell the public what is happening, how they assess the respective risks in their various options, and so forth is pretty convincing. Still, I have to wonder if NASA would really go to all this expense and trouble in trying to save one person whose odds of survival are stacked this high against him.A few other random points: *Some breath-taking Martian and outer space scenery. I would have liked more in this department, particularly on Mars-in-general, but I suppose that one of the film's strengths is that it doesn't try too hard to bedazzle us. The primary mission here is to show one fellow's fight to survive in a distant and hostile environment.*Some real surprises and turnabouts which, particularly toward the end, descend into yeah-right unlikelihoods and too-easies. Many people, it seems, would rather have big stretches and reaches than boring predictabilities, and the whole story is, of course, pretty unlikely, though not impossible. Nevertheless, the makers of this film could have tried a little harder in several key places.*Though I've never been a huge Matt Damon fan, those who are should enjoy his performance as marooned exobotanist Mark Watney. Jessica Chastain, Sean Bean, and a couple of others steal the show insofar as acting goes: It's just unfortunate that we don't see more of them. Much of the dialogue, particularly Watney's—""In your FACE, Neil Armstrong!"" etc--is rather hokey and not quite as clever as intended.*While I'm a novice in these areas, some of the science and technology here is obviously implausible, and I would guess that most rocket scientists and physicists would find it downright ludicrous in a number of spots.*Last but certainly not least, the zero-g scenes are a lot of fun. Trying to leave the stadium-style theater at the end, I was so marvelously disoriented that I walked UP toward the camera portal instead of DOWN toward the exit. (Yes, I mean this in a good way.)"
272," Disappointment: Human Survival Was Never Taken So Lightly
","I was really looking forward to this film as it had a really good plot that could explore the survival struggle of a human in isolation, loneliness, fear and uncertainty. Unfortunately, the film did not do any of these; we watched a badass who was stuck on Mars get back to earth. Since the very beginning, it felt as if the hero knew he would survive, and the theme of fear and isolation was never explored by the director. In the first half of the film, the only time we see fear is by an explosion of the artificial farm, there is also the potato counting scene when there is a storm. Both of which are extreme, showy ways of introducing fear; however under isolation like that, every moment would be full of uncertainty, and this can be explored without using explosions. It is difficult to explore these emotions with a single character, but that is what the story requires. ""Cast Away"" does a very good job of this. In Interstellar, one line of Matt Damon very successfully demonstrated this ""You don't know how good it feels to see someone's face again.""; whereas in The Martian, the whole movie was not able to explore the mental state of the character.I was also expecting to get a better feeling of being space, the dead silence and how small the humans are. This was also not demonstrated well, something which Interstellar did very well, both visually and audio-wise.The movie is not completely bad though; it was funny and the last scene where he meets the crew built up very well with elements of fear and uncertainty. The way he reached the commander was also very breathtaking.In my opinion, the film disrespects the human survival struggle by taking it so lightly, poor job from Ridley Scott. Also note this; the idea of colonizing space is introduced in this movie."
273," The Best Movie I've Ever Seen
","I thought it was the best movie of 2015! I'm not overrating on this, but it's truly a genius movie. If a friend or someone ask me, ""Do you find this movie is good? Do you recommend it?"" I'll answer a hundred percent yes. Perfect cinematography (why did only r-scott, matt, and the editors who get the nominees, it's should've been the cinematography). I didn't read the book yet, i don't even know that there is the book of The Martian. But i thought it was amazing.The film is very emotional, and Matt live it perfectly (i cried a lot) so if you guys are a sci-fi fan you have to watch it or you're wasting your time as a sci-fi fan (it's too much :P) It's the combination of drama that will make us like touched but also frightening sci-fi plot. Yes, it's exactly to pick Ridley Scott, i mean he's a sci-fi 'god' look at his film! I complety NOT disappointed, satisfied, entertained, this is the best movie. One more, damn you R-Scott!But this movie has one weakness, this movie took a quite long time to make the viewer figure out some thing, like SOL, in the beginning, i didn't understand what is it? It takes a quarter hour to figure out. Or it's just me who has a stinky brain :DNB: Watch it, take my words, you'll NEVER regret my suggestion. Oh, don't watch it with kids under 13. First, they'll get bored, second, they don't understand, that's what makes them bored, Third, there's some brief scene when Mark Whatney butt shown."
274," One of the best films ever, you will have to be careful not to become an addict.
","I had huge expectations for The Martian, i just love this kind of movies, and of course the combination of Ridley Scott and an ensemble cast like this is just pure perfection. And it was too bad that the film wasn't in Imax theatres. But, did the film meet my expectations? Well, it sure did!The film has this feeling, a feeling so unique that it's like nothing i have ever seen, and it's definitely one of the most addictive films i ever saw. From the very first frame, it grabs you with such a force it never lets you go, even when you leave the theatre. It just stays with you. And its impossible to take your eyes off the screen. The story is just perfect, the setting is unique, the cast is beyond perfect, and i don't know if this can be a spoiler but if it is, **WARNING** SPOILER AHEAD: Sean Bean doesn't die on this one!I Know, its insane! Obviously Matt Damon shines brighter than the sun in here, but the other actors also shine a lot. And Ridley Scott is in top notch, while i would change some camera shots (as usual in his films) i understand his perspective.Basically this is a film about one man trying to survive in Mars and get back home after it was left there because everyone thought he was dead. And even if we get a lot about the people that are trying to get him back home and a little about his crew that left him there, this is basically a biography about Matt Damon's character, and i really would like to have seen much more of the crew, but i understand what The director and writer did. This film is unique in every way possible, but i guess ultimately what makes him so unique is the main character, because instead of the usual depressing character in this situations (understandably of course!) here, we get an above normal optimistic character that simply put doesn't want to die and deals with problems with an optimistic way that delivers tons of gold comedy. This makes for a much more different narrative, but of course makes the character feel a little off, because it doesn't have those depressed moments, or looks like his suffering with the loneliness or the problems. While i would enjoy some of these moments, or to know a little more about this character, i also understand the goals here.And is here that i think the film should have some more complex emotional moments, that explored more and deeper, some themes and characters. And to me this is why after only one view, that the film isn't perfect, even though i probably will give it a 10 because i think i loved the film so much it makes me forget that.The film has a rushed feeling, that it would be overcomed if the length were bigger, and the ending, particularly, isn't among my favourites because of this. But its nothing that compromises the quality of the film.The production values are just beyond perfect of course, or this wouldn't be a Ridley Scott film. From the hauntingly beautiful visuals, to the insanely realistic production design to the thrilling score, it's just pure perfection!This is one of the most original and unique films ever and it is instantly a favorite, it has such a strong force that you are pulled to its orbit right from the beginning. And it will make you think a lot after you leave the theatre. Thrilling moments abound, comic moments to spare, and plenty of drama makes this one of the best films ever, And is insanely realistic you just forget you are watching a film, and think that this is a documentary about a real life event. What more can you ask?"
275," Don't miss this movie
","The Martian is my second favorite book of all time, so I was very worried Hollywood would find some way to mess this up. While they left out plenty from the book, the character of the book was very faithfully interpreted and the movie actually brought me to tears.This might be the only time I've ever seen Hollywood reduce the amount of danger, action, and vulgarity to make a movie that appealed to a younger audience. It's really out of character for Hollywood to downplay an explosion, but hey, the movie is already 2 hours and 21 minutes.Everything about this movie is top notch, from the A-list actors, to the special effects, to the soundtrack, to the directing, to the extras. I'm extremely proud of Matt Damon on this one, since he's been successful enough he could have coasted. Instead, he knocked it out of the park, even becoming visibly emaciated at the appropriate point, which goes to show the level of discipline a true professional really has.Read the book, but don't miss this movie."
276," Terrible
","Did Ridley make Blade Runner, Alien, ...?Who wrote music for this movie? Or better, who chose soundtrack?While casting is ""OK"" and ""SciFi"" effects are ""OK"", songs used in this movie just do not go by.I would pick better songs.Shame, since it would be much better movie with properly selected songs and better sound effects.I was disappointed. I think Ridley or someone who is choosing music and sound for this kind of movies lost his/her touch.I am still waiting for better SciFi movie since Looper in this decade."
277," The Middling
","Charismatic leading actors can elevate films of they are well cast and 'The Martian' illustrates this point better than most. Matt Damon has enough screen presence to carry this mess off and carry the audience along with him.A large and illustrious production team also maintain acceptably high production standards and fairly imaginative production design work.....although at no single point did I think that anything looked like it couldn't have easily been filmed on Earth in a studio on a sound stage or semi dessert location. There wasn't a single moment of remarkableness in the visual design of the film.The artistic designs of the space vehicles and space travel seemed particularly unremarkable compared to other contemporary space sci-fi films.The script was miserably distracted from the fairly routine ""Lone survivor"" narrative structure of 'carrying on surviving at any cost' main plot by silly space stories about loads of mundane things: such as extremely likely threats and risks to possible near-future spacefarers; and scientific/engineering challenges, being treated utterly incredibly and implausibily.I did not find this ratio of straight and silly to be a harmonious tonal balance.Thank heavens for Matt Damon. The stand out feature of this feature film. All the other actors could have been ""anyones"", their characters certainly were.Ridley Scott made excellent films, sadly, he now seems to make indulgent films referential only to his own preoccupations. How will his 21st century ouvre be compared to his 20th? My answer is frankly: ""unfavourably"".I rate a 4/10 for a film that greatly disappointed me, but I'd recommend this firmly to Matt Damon fans and indeed, with rather more qualification, to anyone appreciative of star power/screen presence/ leading actors"
278," Embarrassingly failed effort
","This film lacks all those quintessential qualities that a seasoned film-goer is entitled to expect from a science fiction film directed by one of the biggest legends of the genre: suspense, innovative characters and props and compelling music. Along with the last- mentioned shortcoming, the frivolous and vapid dialogue is an awkward mismatch with the overall theme of the film. Likewise, there are too many major inconsistencies to dismiss in the story line. Simply put, this effort deserves to be forgotten."
279," Not Brilliant.
","Surprised it was a Ridley Scott film, very mediocre, emotionless, I couldn't wait for it to end. Matt Damon plays the part of Mark Whitney Astronaut stranded on Planet Mars after a raging storm causes a projectile to hit him and causing the rest of his crew to assume he his dead and therefore leave him behind.. He put in a good enough performance but I can't quite believe his nonchalant attitude in the film about being left on Mars it was like he'd missed a Train but hey ho no problem. Fortuanely his Character is a Botanist, so he plants potatoes and uses his own faeces as fertiliser. Is it that simple - I think not. As expected the crop is a great success and you hear him say that he was once told that if you grew on a planet you had created a Colony therefore he'd Colonised Mars. There's no end to his talents and what he can do with a plastic sheet and duct tape after the air lock was blown needs imagination! It's the usual trials and tribulations before he is rescued. On the plus side the music is good and the landscape authentic looking."
280," Suspenseful tale of how..
","to survive on Mars long enough to be rescued. This was a good movie. Matt Damon is part of a group of astronauts on Mars. A huge storm comes and they must evacuate. Damon is hit by debree, suit punctured, so he is presumed dead and left behind. But the pole that went into him stopped the suit leak and he survived. He must grow food and make the rations last longer. He finds an older satellite and can communicate with earth. NASA comes up with a plan to save him. Of course, things don't go according to the plan. But the crew that left him behind, is brave and does the right thing and they get their guy back.FINAL VERDICT: It's cool to see how a hopeless situation works out. Definite recommend."
281," An Intelligent Space Thriller
","These stories of isolated individuals -- ""Castaway"", ""Robinson Crusoe,"" ""Jeremiah Johnson"" -- can be difficult to pull off. They can turn banal in a hurry. Poor Thoreau couldn't do a satisfactory job. ""First, I felled the small fir, then adzed the bark and trimmed the mesophyllum into rabbits for the lallies."" ""The Martian"" pulls it off with aplomb, helped greatly by a courageously demanding script from screenwriter Drew Goddard. A cornucopia of plaudits to the guy, and to Ridley Scott for doing a fine job with the direction, and to the performers who are all at the top of their game, especially Chiwetel Ejiofor as a member of the team back on planet earth. The climax is about as tense as it gets. The musical score, alas, is generic.The story is pretty well-known by now. Matt Damon is a botanist, part of an exploratory team on Mars, who gets accidentally left behind. He sets about providing a habitat for himself, much in the manner of a test pilot who has run into troubles. As Chuck Yeager has pointed out, the pilot in distress doesn't panic. He just asks, ""What do I do next?"" It may sound a little boring but it's not. Damon's Martian doesn't despair. He describes exactly what he's doing to a video recording he intends to leave behind as a record if he dies. We are the video recording device. He's pretty chipper throughout. An experiment goes awry and he presents his injured face to the device and says, ""Okay. I blew myself up."" About a third of the movie deals with the team back on earth and with the crew of the Hermes, the space craft that left Damon behind. The commander of the Hermes is Jessica Chastain, whom I admire a great deal. It's not just that she's attractive because she's less like a typical Hollywood glamour queen and more like the pretty women ahead of you in the supermarket checkout line. She has a strong jaw but her pale presence suggests fragility, as if one of her long bones might break if she slipped and fell down. I grovel in wonderment at her nose. It assumes a normal tangent from the plane of her face but at its very tip it forms an impudent little outward projection.Speaking of tangents, that reminds me. Some viewers might find the dialog a little challenging -- velocity in so many meters per second, escape acceleration, ""sols"" instead of days, Schroedinger's cats or whatever. It didn't bother me a bit. It all sailed completely over my head in the most satisfying way."
282," I really wanted to like this movie
","I really wanted to like this movie and i was excited when i went to see it. The effects and the setting is great, but the movie never delivered. It completely lacks suspense due to its long run and extreme rate of predictability. When i found out that the rescue mission had to take another trip around the sun, which meant at least one more hour in the theater for me, i almost walked out. To top it off, it also became quite annoying with try-hard one-liners like ""I've got to science the s**t out of it"", and silly gags about where for instance excessive use of ketchup is supposed to be funny. I realize that this is done to give the movie a broader appeal, but it also dumbs it down considerably. From the marketing about how it contains accurate science etc, I expected a more ""hardcore"" science fiction movie, but it felt more like an episode of Iron Man in terms of ""science"" and ""humor""."
283," Technically Great and a Wonderful Performance by Damon
","The Martian (2015)*** 1/2 (out of 4) On a mission to Mars a crew of astronauts get caught in a brutal storm when one member, Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is hit with an object and apparently killed. The commander in charge (Jessica Chastain) decide to leave the planet and NASA must announce that Watney has been killed but soon they all discover that he survived. Now Watney must find a way to try and survive on the planet with a lack of food and water.Ridley Scott's THE MARTIAN is an extremely entertaining movie and it's easy to see why it became such a box office hit. The idea of a man being trapped on a different planet and having to decide whether he wants to live or die is such a simple idea and there's no question that Scott knows how to handle drama and tension in space. The film has a very good story to draw you in but I'm not going to lie and say I didn't have any problems with the movie but more on that in a bit.A lot of credit certainly goes to Scott who handles the material extremely well and most importantly is the fact that he makes you believe that this man is actually trapped on Mars. If the viewer thought they were just looking at a set or just some fake CGI then it would pretty much kill the story. By Scott creating a real environment you have no problem believing that you're seeing a man trapped on a planet with his closest help millions of miles away. On a technical level the film contains some wonderful cinematography, a great and rousing score and of course brilliant sound effects and set designs.Damon's excellent performance is another very important factor because we need an actor who we're not only going to believe in the part of a brilliant astronaut but we also must be entertained by him and care for him. Damon certainly makes you believe that he's this brilliant mind and there's no question that his one-man-show is something the actor nails. We get a strong group of supporting players including a very good Chastain plus strong work from Jeff Daniels, Michael Pena, Kristen Wiig, Kate Mara, Donald Glover and Chiwetel Ejiofor.As I said, I did have some major problems with the film including the fact that it just seems like everything happened way too easily. I understand this is a mainstream movie that couldn't get into great detail because it might confuse or bore the viewer but I just thought the film would have worked even better had it been more realistic. Of course, I'm no space expert so perhaps what happens here is 100% believable. I'd also say that the film is also a tad bit too predictable. Either way, THE MARTIAN is certainly a very good movie."
284," Ridley Scott does it again!

285," The Martian's Saturated Space Frontier is Far From Cinema's Usual Blank Spaces!
","Space is an endless stretch of deep, unfeeling, obsidian black that swallows up the curious and adventurous and spits them out without remorse. Space is exhilarating, mystifying, and ultimately terrifying - or at least that's what we've been led to believe by space disaster movies. The Martian throws all of that out the window with a wink and a mischievous grin.Set in the near future, 'The Martian' opens on Mars, where a team led by Melissa Lewis (Jessica Chastain) is wrapping up a month-long space mission. Soon, a fierce sandstorm catches the astronauts out in the open, and they barely make it to the Martian lander that will return them to the orbiting mother ship. But one of them, botanist Mark Watney (Damon), gets hit by a rogue piece of debris. Believing him dead, Lewis has no choice but to take off without him before the storm makes liftoff impossible.But Mark isn't dead. He awakens to a beeping alarm in his helmet telling him he's almost out of air. He struggles out of the sand in which he is half buried and discovers that he has been skewered by a shard of wind-blown metal and barely makes it into the now unoccupied housing module. Meanwhile, back on earth, NASA and the rest of the world are mourning Mark's loss; at least until satellite surveillance of Mars shows signs of activity at the outpost. Faced with the incredible possibility that Mark is alive, the best minds on the planet get to work on an ambitious plan to bring him home before his supplies run out.At this point, The Martian could have become just another grim, white-knuckle-tense space disaster movies. Instead, The Martian does something unexpected. It embraces comedy - balancing knuckle-biting suspense with dollops of humor. It presents Watney as a fairly cocky, genuinely funny, easygoing everyman who just happens to be the only living thing on this entire planet. This big screen adaptation (by Drew Goddard) of Andy Weir's best-seller has just about everything: laughs, thrills, visual splendor and a rousing endorsement of the brotherhood. Ridley Scott directs with nerve and verve, delivering an almost perfect piece of popular filmmaking. Bringing optimism, nerd-itude and a touch of crazy to his character's solo ordeal, Matt Damon is the key to the movie's exuberance. Damon has never seemed more at home than he does here, millions of miles adrift, shouldering the weight of the role with diligent grace. In the face of incredible odds, he ensures Mark Watney remains an endlessly charming protagonist. The rest of the supporting cast also pitches in noteworthy performances.But the Martian's greatest asset is that it remains relentlessly, hopefully human. It takes all the romance out of Mars, but substitutes in its place science, cooperation and perseverance – a fair bargain that results in an intimate sci-fi epic that is smart, spectacular and stirring."
286," It was as bad as I expected.
","I am sorry but I can't understand why this film got such good reviews and that Matt Damon was nominated for Best Actor. This was a terrible movie.I found myself very conflicted at the end of this movie. On the one hand I so wanted this movie to be over. On the other I was shaking my head thinking there should be more to this movie. That was a terrible ending.A few Questions: 1) If Matt Damon's character (Don't remember, don't care) is a botanist, as he states, how does he come to know mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, rocket science, computer software development, advanced mechanic skills, extraordinary navigation ability, piloting skills, and (believe it or not) a master hair stylist...If he knows all that, what was the purpose of the rest of the crew?Seriously, he could have done the entire mission on his own. Why send so many people when superman , brainiac was already there. What more could they have done, that he wasn't capable of?2) If the Chinese are concerned about the secrecy of their rocket technology, why give it to a bunch of government rocket scientists from America who understand exactly what you have? Seems like the worst place to keep you tech under wraps.3) How the heck did Matt Damon get an Oscar nod? Or any other award for that matter. This was a horrible performance. Little to no emotion. No character development all. And that goes for the rest of the cast. Who were these people? Do we care at all about any of them? I would put this just ahead of the Star Wars prequel movies (1-3) as far as acting is concerned.Do you want to know who should have gotten an Oscar??????.....The Potatoes.I found myself caring more about whether or not they lived or died than any character in here.Snoozefest..."
287," This is what Gravity should have been
","Ridely Scott is back in his masterful elements in this movie, recalling what what made Alien and Blade runner so great, but was not great in Prometheus , and that is captivating and exciting story. How exciting do you think it would be to watch 2 hour 40 mins of a man stranded on Mars? Not very exciting. In gravity we had to watch Sandra bullock bounce around for 1 hours 20 min, which is exactly half of the Martian running time, and it is Martian which felt faster and shorter.The key is the brilliant screenplay of this movie that always keeps the story interesting. When our man(Mat Damon) gets mistaken for dead and left stranded on the red planet by his team. He must use scientific knowledge, training and acumen to survive. This is actually far closer to real science, not your Star Trek ""warp-core- manifold"" variety. He has to use whatever is at his disposal to grow his own food, produce water and to find ingenious way of calling home. To watch him come up with one ingenious idea after the other is a treat to watch and never too unrealistic, as we repeatedly learn he is good at what he does.Technically, this is a flawless production cinematography, VFX, sound, production design all work. The VFX are seamless and do not draw attention to themselves, making it look as if they really shot the movie on location -- on Mars!This is a Matt Damon vehicle all the way, supported by an competent supporting class, but their characters barely get the screen time to grow. But that is OK, because Matt Damon is so brilliant and deserves an Oscar for making his lonely stay on Mars so entertaining for the viewer."
288," The Martian focuses on the triumph of human ingenuity under duress.
","Is The Martian science fiction or science fact? Well, it's set in the near future, in 2035, so it's not easy to call it science fiction, although it's technically science fiction. It's not entirely science fact either because some of the science on display in The Martian is questionable. What matters, however, is that the film is entertaining and memorable. There's no question that Ridley Scott is one of the best directors working in Hollywood. Prometheus (2012) marked his return to the science fiction genre, and now we have The Martian, which is even better. Prometheus is a visually impressive film that, unfortunately, has a confusing plot, poor characterization, and pacing issues. It was an attempt to repeat the formula of Alien (1979) and maybe even Aliens (1986), with mixed results. The Martian, on the other hand, isn't dark and confusing. It's straight-forward and upbeat. It centers around an astronaut (Matt Damon) who gets stranded on Mars and has to survive. His struggle to get in contact with NASA and to return home is what keeps the film running. I was surprised by how entertaining the film is. Firstly, the characters in The Martian make rational decisions. They're not a bunch of degenerates and fools who run around and get into trouble, like in Prometheus. And the performances from the cast are all solid. Leading man Matt Damon did good work playing Mark Watney, someone who's often funny and hardly ever depressed. Jessica Chastain, Kristen Wiig, Jeff Daniels, Michael Pena, Kate Mara, Sean Bean, Sebastian Stan, Aksel Hennie, and Chiwetel Ejiofor are in supporting roles. Secondly, the science that's on display in the film is interesting. Some of what is shown makes viewers think, and wonder what's going to happen. Viewers can actually learn a few things from the film. This is due to the fact that the film is based on Andy Weir's 2011 novel, which was adapted into a screenplay by Drew Goddard. And, of course, The Martian is visually impressive, something that's to be expected from a Ridley Scott film. Some of the scenes set on Mars are stunning. The designs of the suits and vehicles are excellent too. So, The Martian is definitely worth recommending. It's a great example of crowd-pleasing cinema."
289," Unexpected Good Fun
","The Martian was deemed a comedy by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association for the Golden Globe awards. It is definitely one of the most fun Ridley Scott films to date, even if it doesn't reach the sophistication of his films Alien and Blade Runner. This film is definitely not trying to be a comedy, however - it is a drama with a fun tone to it.Contributing to this fun tone is an ensemble made up of actors with great comedic chops such as Kristen Wiig, Donald Glover, and Michael Pena. Matt Damon recording his log while on Mars also proves to be funny throughout most of the movie. His character is great and shows a wide range of personality - he is a smart-aleck and sarcastic when he is optimistic, and he is rightfully ticked off the next moment. In both of these situations Damon plays it so perfectly to come across as funny in both instances.His performance does get more dramatic though. As he spends more and more time on Mars he becomes desperate yet optimistic that he will be rescued. It is also unclear whether Damon had to lose weight for part of the performance, as weight loss in the character was noticeable but seemed almost unnatural upon viewing - heavy chance cgi was involved. Either way, Damon's performance in this film proves to show talent on a wide range of the spectrum.The shots are constructed very well in this film. The editing proves to be interesting as well. A lot of point of view shots are used and are labeled as such - most notably there are shots that represent directly the video log Damon's character is recording, and shots from inside his helmet and over his shoulder are used and labeled along the lines of ""suit camera - Watney.""There's also a huge focus on technology - most notably screens - in this film as well. It is how NASA must communicate with Watney - first by satellite images, then by a camera on Mars with Watney, then through what is essentially e-mail. When NASA is communicating with other people on Earth the communication is done through the use of screens as well. It is unclear whether this is simply because technology allows for this way to communicate in our day and age, or if this is a commentary on the way we use technology. Or perhaps this is to compare and contrast to Watney's struggles - he is constantly recording video logs, but those logs are not used for communication.In the third act of the film it seems very similar to Apollo 13 since the focus is to help an astronaut come home. Since the struggle is to retrieve a lone survivor rather than to figure how to land on Earth safely, it proves to be more interesting and a lot more complex. Looking over the other great films of 2015, this film is amongst them, but not quite towards the top. This was an unexpectedly really fun movie from Ridley Scott.3.5/4.0"
290," Despise all the haters I do like Sci-Fi's like The Martian
","Why am I not surprised to see that there are a lot of negative reviewers for The Martian? Because some people can just not relax and enjoy a movie. Why are they being so critical about it? Because suddenly they are all specialists in physic laws and they can't stand that there are inaccuracies regarding those laws of physics. Really? Can't you just not see it's a sci-fi made for your pleasure. I also know that the whole story would be completely impossible in real life but do I care about that? No because first of all I'm not a scientist, I don't work for Nasa or whatever space project. I just watch a movie to be entertained. And The Martian is entertaining. You hope everything ends well. You do live with the movie. To me that's the essential. Beautiful shots with Matt Damon that proves us again that he is a great actor. So basically if you are not a whiner like some here on IMDb you will probably enjoy the movie like I did."
291," So touching!
","This film tells the remarkable story of an astronaut stranded on Mars during a space mission. He does everything he can to survive, while the Earth sets up an unprecedented rescue mission to bring him back home safely.Many people say ""The Martian"" is a very good film, and I do agree after watching it. The plot is simple but it has all the right elements to capture the viewers' hearts. To see Mark survive against all odds is very engaging and touching. In addition, the Herculean efforts to rescue him back to Earth is even more touching because there are almost insurmountable technical difficulties. The risk of failure is so high, that death seems almost certain. That of course brings about an poignant ending, which surely leaves me in tears. I enjoyed watching ""The Martian""."
292," It's Too Bad, But I've Already Seen Classic Sci-Fi Survial Films Like Robinson Crusoe On Mars(1964) and Enemy Mine(1985).
","But as a time-pass film it's definitely worth a watch. This is Matt Damon's second science-fiction horror film film following Elysium(2013).This film is directed by the highly acclaimed director who is best known for the cult science-fiction horror film film Alien(1979) The film is about a stranded astronaut Mark Watney who is left behind on Mars. The first part of film is about how he manages to stay alive while a rescue mission is planned. Mark Watney is a botanist by profession, and as his food source is dwindling he decides to grow some potatoes in Mars's soil.The second part of the film deals with the planning essential to his rescue. NASA director Theodore ""Teddy"" Sanders(veteran actor Jeff Daniels) debates whether the lives of Mark's fellow astronauts is worth risking to save one life.Public concern increases as Marks plight is televised back on Earth. Mission commander Melissa Lewis(Jessica Chastain) deliberately disobeys her orders and plots a course to rescue Mark.Will Mark be rescued or will further disaster ensue? Watch the film to find out what happens next...Verdict: Cast is decent. The photography is by the acclaimed Dariusz Wolski(The Crow 1994, Crimson Tide 1995, A Perfect Murder 1998, Hide and Seek 2005, Prometheus 2012). Harry Gregson-Williams has directed the music for the film. He has worked in films like The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, X-Men Origins: Wolverine and the Shrek franchise.Supporting actors Sean Bean, Michael Peña, Chiwetel Ejiofor(Amistad 1997, 12 Years a Slave 2013), Benedict Wong and Donald Glover give professional performances.There is one more thing I must mention, earlier I saw The Europa Report(2013) which I consider to be the best modern science fiction film ever made. I sincerely recommend you to see this film in theater, online or through DVD/BLU RAY rental.More films to see: Journey to the Far Side of the Sun a.k.a. Doppelgänger (1969), Mission To Mars(2000), Red Planet(2000), Gravity (2013), The First Men in the Moon (1964) and lastly the superb film based on the true events of Apollo 13 made into a 1995 film directed by the acclaimed Ron Howard.Thank you for reading my review, live long and prosper."
293," A nice rocket ride while it lasts
","(68%) A well made space survival adventure that mixes Apollo 13, Castaway and Interstellar in a very watchable treat that marks a lighter entry into Ridley Scott's filmography. The pacing is sharp, the performances from the strong cast are solid and this never becomes anything other than a likable sit. Unlike something such as Castaway the plot is more required to follow both the captive (Matt Damon) and the rest of the cast who's only objective is to try and help rescue him, so there is a fair amount of switching between the two focal points rather than pure Matt Damon in space trying to get by. Without doubt this is a band apart from the lesser films of the year, but I doubt it will top my list mainly because for me it came and went without hardly any lasting impact. So by the end it is enjoyable while it lasts with plenty of heart and entertainment value, but it didn't send as many shock-waves upon me as it did so many others. Nice throwback soundtrack though."
294," Now that is how to make a great space movie based on an epic novel!
","Having read the novel I was eagerly anticipating seeing how they would capture the complex story in a standalone film. Being a space professional I was skeptical that they could present the science and engineering, and make it realistic, without bogging the story down with a lot of exposition.In both aspects the film was a complete success! The novel's major plot points, humor, and humanity translated very well to the screen. The science and engineering were plausible, and nicely balanced by the artistic choices that were made. I thoroughly enjoyed this masterpiece. Kudos to the entire Team that brought ""The Martian"" to the screen."
295," Visually stunning with excellent acting
","Ridley Scott's The Martian is a straight forward, yet visual alluring movie about a man stranded on Mars and the team effort from Earth to bring him home. From the beginning, it gets straight to the plot and beautifully illustrates Mark Whatney's long, arduous and painstaking tale of survival and the NASA/JPL's (with some help) persistent and tireless team effort to bring him home. Ridley Scott directs the film with beautiful storytelling and stunning visuals. The plot does not meander and the scenery and visual effects are exemplary. Mars looks and feels real and the satellite imagery is used appropriately. The humor is intoxicating and keeps the audience entertained. Most importantly the human determination and strong spirit is the key to the film's success. We all aspire to be the best we want to be and when we run into trouble, we should always try to remain hopeful of the situation and never ever give up. An excellent cast consisting of comedic actors like Kristen Wiig, reliable character actors like Jeff Daniels and Michael Peña (the former who doesn't let his character become a caricature and brings a bit of Gregg Popovich in him and the latter who is great as always), Marvel characters like Kate Mara and Sebastian Stan, new names that some of the audience may have never heard before like Aksel Hennie, Benedict Wong, McKenzie Davis and Donald Glover and those in the background elevate the film from being an ordinary film. Jessica Chastain is wonderful as the commanding officer, portraying her character's reactions with great naturalism. Sean Bean is a delight as the Flight Director who eschews PR distractions by using his practicality and common sense to bring the crew home.But the film belongs to Matt Damon and Chiwetel Ejiofor. Damon is brilliant as the main character Whatney who tries to do the best he can to survive on Mars. Each aspect of his acting does not feel forced and his deadpan is hilarious. Most importantly his will to live drives the film and we feel as if we are with him and we want him to return home. He can add this performance to his personal top 5. In my opinion, Ejiofor is at the peak of his acting prowess and he is fantastic as Vincent Kapoor who is deeply involved about the fate of the crew and will do anything it takes to bring them home. He is to be lauded for making Kapoor a strong willed humanist who is compassionate to everyone and views them as equals and simultaneously as a no nonsense engineer who wants things done at the best of their capabilities in order to save life. To him like Ed Harris's portrayal of Gene Kranz in Apollo 13, failure is and will not be an option. Background music is good, but the 70s soundtrack is even better much to the annoyance of Whatney.Overall, this movie with its simple storyline, arresting visuals, and excellent ensemble led Damon and Ejiofor with honorable mentions to Chastain and Bean is something to experience. Most importantly, the human determination and spirit is the most memorable aspect of the movie and will linger with you as you leave the theater.9/10"
296," No masterpiece here
","(Full disclosure: I was a little torked during the movie due to drinking a whole flask of bourbon rather quickly, but with some popcorn.)It's hard to watch a movie like The Martian without trying to put yourself in the hero's shoes. I've read some studies about total isolation suggesting everyone goes crazy without some meaningful human interaction. I know people have lived hermetic lives in deserts, so clearly someone with enough mental composure could survive alone for a couple of years, even if being unable to ""science the sh*t"" out of anything in particular. My first reaction to solitude for the first time in months would've been to engage in a masturbatory marathon, but our hero instead spends time thinking about mundane projects like trying to grow enough food to survive until he can be rescued.Our hero is Mark Watney. He's a hero because he gets hit by some space stuff and everyone else on his team does the French goodbye. I have a hard time hearing ""Watney"" without reminiscing over Watney's Cream Stout, but I did have trusty bourbon at hand. The Martian imagery surely recalls Prometheus, especially the scenes involving roving around in rovers. However, we get horrible running jokes about (bad) disco music, which differentiates it wildly from Prometheus. There's nothing predator gross or alien scary running around Mars (this time).It's a triumph of the spirit (will, even, if you will), slightly jingoistic and Americanly exceptionalist, until NASA needs help from China. Instead of the annoying just-in-time saves we see all too often in disaster films, the Martian is riddled with just-in-time disasters, much like every episode of Gilligan's Island (except I'm pretty sure there was some later TV movie where they get off the island or go back and start a hotel with the Harlem Globetrotters). The movie is too long, I didn't care whether they saved our hero, and the special effects of space movies still have yet to outperform 1968's 2001: A Space Odyssey.The good: The Martian reminds us that Sean Bean should be in every movie, Matt Damon is in too many movies, and Kristen Wiig can adequately do non-comedy. Michael Peña survives without being too campy or loud, and Jeff Daniels can cash a check with the best of them. Impressively, this might be the first movie I've seen all year that is pro-science."
297," Zero out of ten stars.
",Brought product to surface of Hollywood - it failed immediately. Zero out of ten stars.If you've read the book the movie will disappoint you. If you haven't read the book it will bore you.The movie adaptation fails on so many levels I don't have the time to list them. What it really comes down to is a tragedy. The heart of the story is absent. The characters are absent. The ending was changed unnecessarily. Why?!Don't waste your time. Just read the book and imagine how awesome a movie it could have been.
298," Disappointing
","This film lacked tension and any strong interaction between the characters - such as they were. Quite soon into watching I felt that it was being strangled by political correctness. It is bland; it is beige; it is, quite simply, not compelling. Towards the end I completely lost interest in it, so little did I care about the outcome."
299," Golden Globe for comedy, comedians miscast in serious roles. ABBA soundtrack. Contrived to make money. Awful, awful.
","This movie may have been initially popular, but it will fade away. To better imagine being on Mars I had to mute the sound to imagine Watney breathing in his space suit whilst he worked, You do get the impression of being on Mars but this is not sustained because of the comedic overtones and stupendous miscasting. I imagined another version being released in the future - a true space drama- deleting the wisecracks, replacing the soundtrack, and reinforcing the success factors such as the sense of isolation, the science, and the fear. But that's not going to happen. People forget this movie is a comedy, yet it is thoroughly unfunny, but it did win a Golden Globe for comedy. Touché from the accountants! Audiences do love an optimistic fantasy depicting triumph over adversity. And what fantasy! The sandstorm that stranded Watney would be no more fierce than being pelted by talcum powder given Mars thin atmosphere. The storm would barely raise a flag. And then there is Watney. Perpetual optimist, says he's a botanist, but botanists are not farmers nor gardeners. The garden he creates is ridiculous, too shallow with no drainage, and the crop yield fantastical (see one of the reviews below which explores this in detail). Watney doesn't suffer much. He is playful, always strong, optimistic, jovial, confident. I don't see him triumphing over adversity."
300," This movie really depressed me...because it was so awful
","There will be no spoiler alerts needed, because I don't have the energy to include any. I will just use some phrases - sophomoric, silly, unbelievable. A few more - scientifically sloppy, highly derivative, utterly predictable. Oh - did I say dull? A few more phrases - horrific acting, dreadful dialog, and the kiss of death - insignificant.Why Hollywood feels that they have to spend a fortune producing this kind of vapid crap is beyond me. Do they have no respect for the intellect of their audiences? Are they simply lazy? We are at the end of watching The Sopranos from beginning to end for the third time - rich plot, character development, and acting. We anxiously await the next seasons of Fargo and Homeland. We miss dearly Six Feet Under. Oh, yes - The Martian. *****yawn***** Don't waste your time or your money - or your brain cells!"
301," Help is only 140 million miles away. For Mark Watney, stranded on Mars.
","We viewed this on DVD from our public library. Picture and sound are first-rate.The premise is somewhere in the 2030s we have advanced our space exploration to successful missions to Mars. While one is underway a large, unforecast storm comes up on Mars requiring the crew of 6 to cut the mission short and use the escape rocket to blast off and rendezvous with the main space ship orbiting Mars. But one of the crew, Mark Watney, is hit by a large object and carried away, injured and out of communications. Reluctantly they have to blast off without him after a short search was futile. Mark was presumed dead.But Matt Damon as Mark Watney didn't give up so easily, he managed to get himself to a base station and using medical tools and staples repaired his wounds and set about trying to figure out how to survive with limited resources. Fortunately with rations for 6 he was able to make food stretch, and as a Botanist even came up with a method to make water and, using his own waste as fertilizer, used a Thanksgiving package of potatoes to grow potatoes in a chamber converted to a greenhouse of sorts.So much of the movie is about Mark's survival, plus his figuring out a way, using old abandoned Mars exploration robots, to communicate with NASA. The real hard part becomes how to plan and carry out a rescue mission. Mars is far away, it takes a long time, he has limited time to survive.The cast is varied and good, with Jessica Chastain as Melissa Lewis, the commander of the mission. Kristen Wiig in a serious role as a NASA communications officer, Jeff Daniels as Teddy Sanders, the NASA chief, Michael Peña as Rick Martinez, the pilot for the mission, Kate Mara as one of the crew, a computer expert, Beth Johanssen, among others.This is a really good and entertaining movie. It is a serious subject but is treated with appropriate humor. EDIT: I re-watched it 8 days later and enjoyed it as much the second time!SPOILERS: When the first rescue approach failed in a faulty rocket launch, a young data nerd calculated, using NASA's super computer, that the crew on their way back to Earth could accelerate and using the Earth slingshot return to Mars, but it would require a risky capture of a re-supply module and a never-rehearsed module take-off from Mars to try to capture Watney in a Mars fly-by. NASA said no to the risk but the crew decided on their own to try the rescue. That whole last scene was very tense and of course it was a success."
302," Misery Loves Company
","Hollow, empty, superficial and without honor. Like an 80s feel good buddy movie, with disco instead of Motown, Damon instead of Julia Roberts. And instead of cracking predictable jokes and laugh lines with his buddy....we have a diary cam. So convenient to move the plot along. It's amazing to me how people don't understand when the plot is being telegraphed to the audience through contrivances -- we're not in the hands of a talented screenwriter. This can be conveyed through action and subtlety i.e. Hanks on the island. Or though clumsy exposition and cardboard characters designed to move the plot forward and explain things to the audience the other characters would already know.Forget all the implausibilities -- I am not a scientist. I just want a good compelling story about a man trying to survive. Instead, it has the tone and depth of a Friends episode. That this averages over 8 stars has not only lowers my faith In IMDb -- I had to shut it off after an hour -- but in Americans, and humanity as a hole. Have you people lost your minds. This is rubbish."
303," Scott's Best Since Alien
","Ridley Scott has made some of the most enduring classics of all time in his 40-year career (Alien, Gladiator, Blade Runner). On the other hand, he has also managed to totally wet the bed in many of his productions, especially in recent years (The Counselor, Robin Hood). This big-hit-or-big-miss track record keeps him surprisingly vital for a 77-year-old man, with his successes often directly relating to their source material. With his most recent, The Martian, an adaptation of a hugely popular novel, he uses that original story to create a beautiful and spirited stranded-planet adventure that rivals anything Scott has done in decades. The survival tale of a NASA astronaut accidentally stranded on Mars begs comparison to recent space disaster films Gravity and Interstellar. While Martian is comparable to those movies high-points in visuals and sheer thrills, it surpasses both in sheer personality. Even though much of Scott's galactic epic focuses on hard science, botany theories, and public relations problems, it far exceeds its inherent dryness with a lively and sharply funny script, and a wonderfully believable turn by Damon. His brainy and silly performance is backed by a deep sense of fear and awe, as he reconciles and even revels in his newfound heroism while never forgetting its colossal danger. This epic tale is told surprisingly economically, never reaching too far past its focal points and keeping us completely engaged. Martian's parable of ingenuity and the will to survive is a smart and fully entertaining science fiction outing that reminds us what great big movies can be: funny, uplifting, transporting, and exhilarating."
304," Underwhelmed
","This about astronaut , Mark Watney , who is left stranded on the Mars after an accident , presumed dead and his fight to survive and ultimately be rescued. Having finally got around seeing The Martian I have to say I was left completely underwhelmed with what I saw. It's absolutely packed full of technical jargon that my eyes glassed over after a while . It's way too long and I was expecting a career defining performance from Matt Damon , having seen other reviews , but it was just Matt Damon being Matt Damon. Nothing new. There is also one of the worst bits of casting I have seen in years and that is Sean Bean as Mitch Henderson . He looks and sounds so out of place , in fact he stumbles through the film looking like he is suffering a massive hangover. This film was definitely not out of this world."
305," a slightly cheesy version of Gravity
","I have not read the fiction, but the structure is appealing: a survival story with space science authentic details. To me, Gravity is a poet, the Martian movie, well, it is kind of cheesy and mediocre.Not a bad movie, it is still fun to watch if you do not need philosophy or inspiration; I can tell everyone worked hard on making the movie. But somehow the loneliness, fear, despair, danger, the life-on-a-thread situation are not delivered enough. It's not Matt Damon's problem, I do not feel those emotions and elements because of the choices of dialogue of actors, what and how to be presented, and what are not shown in the screenplay and editing. The bigger trouble is, some actors who played NASA staff, rather look like staff in a theme park or a mall. In reality, NASA staff may look like ordinary people, but I just cannot believe some of the actors on that screen are NASA staff. Glad to know that the last scene of Matt Damon was not from the original writer, because it is such a mediocre closure."
306," Because I don't have eleven stars
","This film lived up nicely to all the pre-release hype. Matt Damon is stranded on Mars when he's blown away by a Martian windstorm and presumed dead, and the expedition has to abort the mission. But he survived, and fixes his injuries, grows potatoes originally intended as a Thanksgiving treat, burns thruster fuel to create water, uses human wastes as fertilizer (for some reason, only his own) and recovers an old Mars lander to improvise communications with Earth. There are a few scientific quibbles. Martian windstorms are just not that powerful since the air is only 1/1000 as dense as earth's. It seems unlikely that the habitat wouldn't have its own communications with Earth, or at least the ability to communicate through the fleet of satellites orbiting Mars. And the ending piles on problems simply for the sake of piling them on. Really, instead of blowing off one end of the rescue ship to generate thrust to slow down, why not just turn and use the thrusters? That way the whole ship is habitable for the return trip instead of just a few cut-off modules. Matt Damon certainly delivers an effective recruiting pitch for NASA, though Jessica Chastain ""swimming"" in zero-g gives him worthy competition. At a time when many people don't consider characters interesting unless they manifest at least half the conditions in DSM-V, some unapologetic rational behavior is a breath of fresh air. Competence porn? Bring it on."
307," Another great sci-fi offering in this decade
","I don't like sci-fi films that much, but these days we have films, which what I thought to have a good combination of creativity and realism such that they are too good to ignore. Both ""Gravity"" and ""Interstellar"" have been considered iconic films in this genre, and this year, we have another one, albeit not as iconic, under the title of ""The Martian"". Although it doesn't have the technical novelty in the same degree as that of ""Gravity"" or the edgy plot that we have encountered in ""Interstellar""; nonetheless, ""The Martian"" manages to be as amazing. The plot is simple, but yet we are treated with a good, if not impressive, execution of the simple and subtle things in the story. It is simple yet brainy. The story basically deals with the humanity's way of solving problems in order to survive. Solve the bigger problem by decomposing it into smaller problems, and then solve them one by one until you have solved enough problems that will probably enable you to survive.It revolves around a scientific expedition to Mars, which was unfortunately hampered by the inaccurately predicted Martian storm. That storm was strong enough to destroy their launch pad, and this forced the crew to leave the Martian research unit. However, during the untimely evacuation, a crew member was hit by debris and was left behind. He was presumed dead, but was later discovered alive through the satellite images received by the Earth. The surviving crew was already on their journey back home when they learned that he was still alive. However, they were facing a difficult logistics problem for his rescue, given the expensive space mission and the distance between Earth and Mars. It would take at least a year at best for a supply or rescue to reach the planet, and perhaps, by that time Mark Watney was already dead.The film focuses on the survival efforts - sounds tedious and depressing for a film to depict - but like the case of other great films, the journey was rather engaging and enjoyable, kudos to the performance of Matt Damon as Mark Watney and the achievement by Ridley Scott as director. Furthermore, the experience was enhanced by the excellent use of visual effects and music. Although, the approach can be considered minimalist, the thrills brought by this film are satisfying. I found the survival process in itself enjoyable, and what makes it even more interesting is that it is not all about the efforts of one man alone, but also the efforts of the people in the Earth to bring Mark Watney back home alive. Matt Damon was surrounded by a compelling supporting cast (to name a few: Jessica Chastain, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Jeff Daniels), and of course a compelling combination of different subject matters: astrophysics, rocket science, botany, chemistry, mathematics, and supercomputers. However, for those who expect a big dose of action and emotions, they may rather find this film disappointing or a bit unfulfilling. There are lots of powerful scenes wherein the director should have managed to bring the experience into full blast but rather chose to ""soft-pedal"" them. Not bad though, but I thought it could have been more amazing. Moreover, the first two-thirds of the film tried to avoid the cliché often associated with films under this genre, but unfortunately it sort of fell to the ""Hollywoodish"" formula in the end, e.g. the scene with the big crowd in the New York Times Square. However, I still say it was an amazing film. This is one of Ridley Scott's best, and I wouldn't be surprised if it gets a lot of attention in the awards season."
308," Out of the world experience
",The Martian was a very highly anticipated movie and i believe that it has truly lived up to its hype - well at least for me.The storyline is just plain awesome- only made better by funny one liners and superb acting. It is both a visual and technical masterpiece which one can watch again and again. I honestly did not find a flaw that bothered me in the movie was left amazed by what i had seen. It was a very exciting two hours(and 20 minutes or so for me) and i will recommend this movie to anyone reading this review. The movie on the whole is not the best movie ever types but it is a movie that will leave you satisfied and content. The acting does complement the movie well to some extent and the movie(in my opinion) is a worthy successor to the book.
309," Blew me away
","This is one of the more memorable movies I have seen, in some ways it is very hard to describe how good I felt it was. Matt Damon shows what I always thought about him, that he is an intelligent actor able to give any role that special touch. He is playing a very intelligent character and he does it seamlessly. He also gives the character a sardonic sense of humor, which means this is not cold or pure hard science. Likewise, when he finally interacts with the rest of the crew of his ship, the interplay is what you would expect.The movie is a rare thing, it is a hard science fiction movie that has the human touch, the casting was fantastic and you see the humanity.It has touches of Apollo 13 where the nerds with the pocket protectors and slide rules pull off a miracle, but it also has a lot of the human emotion, humor and at times sadness, that make it real. John Campbell, considered the founder of modern SF, said that science fiction was not about the technology, but about how human beings react to it, and that is the core of this movie. The fact that the technology here is not star wars level, but technology that either does or potentially could exist in the near future, and it makes it come off as something that might happen.It is also nice to see a movie where the heroes are not all white nerdy guys, plenty of those, but plenty of other people, the mission is commanded by a woman, women play major roles, and you have a lot of non white people as scientists and such. I think that helps give the feeling of awe the movie generated in me, that it was a mish mash of people working to have this happen. The movie is long, yet it didn't seem like that, and where you have a movie where a single character is on the screen most of the time and it doesn't drag, that says something. The filming is well done, and this has elements of a lot of Ridley Scott's work, though I personally think it is his masterpiece, if this is his last movie it is a doozie."
310," Absurd premise- flase science
","So an astronaut is accidently left on Mars- and the gov't thinks they should spend ""an awful lot of money""- to run a program to get him back. with how many personnel (100, more ) hardware, working overtime for how many months. cost of a rocket. I can't even imagine the costs- a Trillion$
In a ""military operation"" loses =how many men and collateral damage. so our government spends all this to recover one man, rather than pretend he is really dead as 1st thought (public relations). it's silly that they accidently left him on Mars. How many other programs would have to be cut?
all that aside, the ridiculous fake science, incorrect basic facts- for Matt to make a biological system, create oxygen, grow food. till he can be rescued. and the loneliness and isolation doesn't affect him.
some other viewers have gone over specifics, so I won't.
Matt -and your people, don't you read scripts."
311," A long and predictable NASA commercial
","I thought this movie would be worth watching...I was so wrong. This movie tries very hard to make you think that NASA engineers have everything calculated to the most insignificant detail, that their engineers know everything about every single known subject by humanity, and they try to make them look cool by playing that disco music (let's not even begin with that). At some point I thought I was watching the A-team show. They use a home-made bomb to de-accelerate the spacecraft? A screen to cover the craft while it leaves Mars (OMG)?Do not watch it unless you can bear a two-hour commercial without feeling nausea. Go read something instead."
312," Life on Mars is not played as a soundtrack.
","You know what, not once in the film do they play the song ""is there life on mars"" by David Bowie, they play another Bowie song but not Life on Mars, talk about negative possibility space it's like the movie sunshine where they do not make the pun ""it's daylight saving time"".Imagine going through life just waiting for a pun or song which would be perfect situation only for it to not show up.Also Sean Bean doesn't die and I was ready for that to happen throughout the entire film, I mean seriously they even reference him being in the council of elrond yet they fail to kill him off at the end of the film. This film would be amazing had it not been for all these mistakes that went about and ruined the damn thing. Also near the end of the film he ends up looking like a pale version of Leonardo diCaprio in the revenant with that crappy beard he grows."
313," God this was bad
","I know this is not a popular opinion. But for real, a movie of this budget, directorial talent and acting prowess should not have been this average.Consider these points:Pace.The movie starts at 100000 km/h, with snappy banter between characters we know nothing about, a cataclysmic sandstorm, and a confused leader making a massive decision. We are then subjected to Matt Damon fighting against the odds to make it back to medical bay where upon he gut wrenchingly removes a huge piece of steel from his side before sighing the word ""Fuck."" From here, the movie degrades slowly into what can best be described as a tribute to Adam Sandler, with slap stick bumping into things, witty quips between poorly developed characters and odd, intrusive monologues about the meaning of life and the virtue of the human soul. Then, at the end of the film, we have a sudden acceleration back to warp speed with the convenient rocket/tarp/duct tape launch followed by a nail bitingly unrealistic jet pack around Martian near space, all the while two of the astronauts whose names I can't remember because they've had zero character development are falling in love in the background. It honestly felt like the film switched writing team half way through, and then switched back.Matt Damon.Was I the only one who felt that Matt Damon was basically walking around saying ""Matt Damon"" for the entire film?

314," Grand Sci-Fi Adventure for Kids
","The Martian is a dyed-in-the-wool Hollywood movie of a grand space adventure. The movie's screen-writing and direction is, true to its subject, like an optimized space-craft, which has exactly those components it requires for its singular objective and absolutely nothing else. The objective of 'The Martian' is to be a good family sci-fi space adventure, following in footsteps of E.T. The Extra Terrestrial, Zathura: A Space Adventure, etc. , that is specifically targeted at the sense of humor of kids and young teens of this generation. The movie also has elements of nostalgia targeted specifically at the generation of their parents. The Martian serves as a vessel that carries its entertaining feel-good story to its intended audience and does it well, but carries little else for anybody else.It is likely that this movie will disappoint several viewers, not so much because it is inherently bad, but more so because it does nothing to satisfy their expectations. In past decade, many PG and G movies have found massive adult following because movie expected to be for kids have turned out to be remarkably deep and rich in story that appeals to grown-ups. The Martian is totally opposite to this trend, in that, it is a movie expected to be for grown-ups with serious space exploration, marooning, desolation, imminent and impending death, existential crisis, nonchalant bureaucratic space administration - an 'Office Space' in space on a Monday... with car keys missing and presentation document lost! The Martian is 'Office Space' that starts on Friday 4 pm with a bit of issues till 5pm, continues through a balmy weekend with well behaved kids, friendly neighbors, BBQ with BYOB, lots of blue clouds and Sun and ends on Sunday night. There are a few instances of trouble with lighter fluid and getting the BBQ going, but nothing that will erase that smile off your face or place the weekend in any real jeopardy. In the end, the kids learn that getting a BBQ requires some patience, and problems of missing charcoal and pickles can be resolved with an indefatigable cheery disposition and lots of banter with your enormously friendly neighbors. So much so that even the, otherwise ignored, Chinese family in the neighborhood can be invited to join the BBQ. Big things can be accomplished when everyone pitches in and works as a team!Summary: Take your kids and go see this movie as a family in a theater near you. It's good entertainment and inspiration for kids. Every generation of kids should have a movie that inspires them to dream of becoming an astronaut someday. The Martian does this well. Others may want to skip this one or watch it on BluRay on a slow evening."
315," Disappointed
","Was expecting much more from the second part. I found myself in moment where I was thinking the last 10 minutes could have easily summed up in 2 and not get me bored. Some of the lines are quite lame and crossing a line. I know it's a movie but show some respect for the people that actually risked their live in the space. ""In your face N. A.? "" really??!! They just couldn't come up with anything else but this lame disrespectful phrase? How can you even compare the main character with the mane that made history? Not taking in consideration scenes where cuts don't sync. Like for ex the scene where he miraculously find the exact spot where an old communication device is buried. And then minutes after the top of device is like 1m above ground. Did he excavated all Mars surface?Not worthy of a cinema ticket. Disappointed with the story line. Matt's performance is not that great either."
316," Scott is back from nadir
","A 3D-screening of the Sci-Fi picture of the year, after GRAVITY (2013), INTERSTELLAR (2014), the momentum of the hard science fiction sub-genre is going pretty strong, and for director Ridley Scott, whose career is badly in need of a revival, THE MARTIAN proves to be a timely global hit to his succour, a return to his most competent genre, and brings him out of his career nadir after THE COUNSELOR (2013) and EXODUS: GODS AND KINGS (2014).As its movie posters plainly assert, the film is about to bring Matt Damon's botanist Mark Watney back to earth after being left alone on Mars by his crew, since they presume he is dead during an unexpected storm during their mission. Based on Andy Weir's scientifically specific source novel and with the official support of NASA, the film adopts a more down-to-earth method to tell the story as realistic as possible, at least meets the basic criterion of today's scientific level.There are two parallel story lines at first, one is on Mars, concerning, the only man (might not be the only living creature thanks to the recent discovery of water) on a foreign planet, completely alone and how he strives to survive, fortunately he can avail himself of his professional know- how to successfully cultivate potatoes on the Mars' soil (which might not be realistic, then again, no one has ever been to the Mars, so everything can be ascribed to the imagination license) and produce water. Meanwhile, he is seeking a way to contact NASA, to let the earthlings know he is stranded, in hope of a rescue mission. And beyond our imagination, he manages to do that too, through the defunct Pathfinder, the roving probe launched on Mars in 1996. On earth, the narrative is centred on Teddy (Daniels), the Director of NASA, Vincent Kapoor (Ejiofor), the director of Mars mission, once they realise Matt's quandary, how they creatively sustain the communication with Mark and collect their wits to a rescue plan.But odds are not in favour of Mark, after a failing launch of a space probe aiming to resupply him for sustain until the next mission, and an airlock disaster destroys all his plants, a third party enters the picture, as the only hope is hinged on Hermes, the spacecraft on its way back from Mars to Earth with Matt's fellow astronauts, lead by captain Lewis (Chastain, a female captain!!), Hermes must extend its mission by another year in space, and firstly it must receive a booster proffered by CNSA (China National Space Administration) on the earth orbit, to resupply the Hermes, so they can return to Mars and get Mark back, and But if you expect some discord among its crew members, you will be disappointed, they are as united as ever, to risk their own life for the risky expedition. This is the final attempt, which unfortunately evolves into a public stunt not just for NASA, for America, but for the whole human race, to affirm that every one and single life counts, as in reality, we know it is not the truth.The film doesn't flaunt its visual grandeur, on the contrary, everything seems subdued for its accuracy, or at least verisimilitude, only the final rescue paragraph, propels us for an adrenalin drive like a less compelling re-take of Sandra Bullock's space yank-and-tossing with George Clooney in GRAVITY, but to an uplifting upshot.Matt Damon delivers a substantially absorbing one-man-show, generates optimism and gives wisecracks through a series of video logs, not an Oscar-bait performance but if he can get a filler nomination for INVICTUS (2009), it means nothing is impossible for him. Considering Mark's situation, facing his despair and loneliness in a lone planet, the most probable denouement is dying there alone, 220,000,000 km from home, his mental journey is short- changed nevertheless, since the film contends to be a satisfactory tale of a man-made wonder, it is understandable they try to whitewash the sombre facet of the ordeal. All the supporting roles are portrayed level-headedly through their professions other than 3-dimensional characters, a guilt-driven Chastain could have been a potential scene-stealer, but that never gonna happen and her crew is too harmonious to allow the captain to risk any emotional turbulence.Fairly speaking, THE MARTIAN is less visually-innovate than GRAVITY and less theoretically- sophisticated than INTERSTELLAR, but for a Ridley Scott's vehicle, it hearteningly reaffirms us that sitting at the age of 78, he is not ready for retirement yet. The film is extremely audience- friendly, roundly constructed, and most admirably, with no calculation to cater to audience's rapacious appetite of hollow special effects."

","Once you want to go for a movie, which's evry part is realistic you gotta stick to that.This film might be realistic enough for a tipical dumb American, but anybody who has a little clue about cosmic radiation,or at least physics would laugh while watching this movie.From the beginning to the end.The story had a huge potential,yet this "" 'muricanization"" ruined it completely.And when I say muricanization, I think of it like a ""okay lets make this film watchable for the dumb people of the USA"" who would even ask each other after the film if it was based on a true story.Well Ridley Scott, if this was the plan, you succeeded, but for anybody who literally has some logic and seen/read some stuff about what would it really be like in the space or on the surface of Mars is just laughing at your ""masterpiece"". It doesn't even take a scientist to know about the micro meteors hitting the Mars constantly,but no problem, Matt Damon will just cover the station's entrance with a plastic bag.

","I really do not care what the movie is about, if Ridley Scott is directing, I want to see it. I mean, how cool is it to be able to go to a movie theater and watch a movie directed by the guy who made Alien, Blade Runner and Gladiator? It's so awesome. The problem is Ridley Scott has been inconsistent over the years, with some less great films, like Exodus: Gods and Kings. I am happy to say, however, the Martian will probably be another Scott classic.The Martian is a very intriguing and smart movie, the cinematography is absolutely stunning and I have no idea where they shot the movie, but one could actually believe they are on Mars. The desert wastelands are just breathtaking. The movie is also very funny, surprisingly and features great performances by a huge cast, especially Matt Damon, who is just awesome in this. Chiwetel Ejiofor is also great, Jeff Daniels, Jessica Chastain, Kristen Wiig, Sean Bean and others do a great job as well.I love movies like this that incorporate real science into the plot, but it also makes it clear to the audience what it all means. It's a great way to make the plot of the movie believable and it worked great in the Martian.Now, there are flaws in the movie, particularly for me it was the pacing. Every single Matt Damon scene is great, the movie feels like Castaway on Mars, and I loved that. But sometimes the focus shifts to the people on Earth and NASA trying to solve the problem and bring Damon's character Mark Watney home. I understand the things that happen on Earth have to be explained in order for the movie to make sense. However, the pacing of the movie slows down a lot and we get to see less of Watney's epic quest for survival. Some sequences towards the end feel slow because of this and there is a very long stretch in the movie that doesn't even show the main character of the film. Once you've established who the hero in the movie is, well, we should be able to follow him in his character ark. And the movie doesn't really let us do this, because it shifts focus so many times.Despite its flaws, The Martian looks great, the effects are pretty good, the cinematography is beautiful and the acting is solid. I didn't particularly enjoy that much of the sequences on Earth, but they were necessary. The Martian, I believe and hope, will be regarded in the future as a very funny Ridley Scott classic."
319," Far from interstellar
","I did not watch Interstellar at the cinema last year, and I was very impressed by that movie on BLURAY.So I wen't day1 at the cinema to watch The Martian, but I'm not that happy.They are some good idea's and a little bit of jokes, but overall the film is too slow and far from emotional compared to Interstellar.Also, the music and sound FX are terrible. Not very recommended.If you did not watch the interstellar movie yet, better watch that one first !Interstellar is much deeper, makes you cry, makes your brain jumping of the discovery and experiences.Hans music is really fantastic in interstellar."
320," ""Space Does Not Cooperate"", but That Won't Stop ""The Martian""
","Beyond the spaceship duels and friendly/unfriendly human/alien encounters, outer space films like the ""Star Wars"" and ""Star Trek"" franchises (and even TV's ""Futurama"") draw their appeal from their confident assurance that someday humanity will not just ""conquer"" space, it will make it so comfortable and familiar that visiting a new planet will be as easy as taking a walk to the neighborhood grocery store. Perhaps, but that hope is at least decades away. Right now, even now, outer space is cold, dark, and above all, so vast that even visiting a relatively close planet like Mars takes an average of four years. And even when you get to Mars, it's barely more hospitable than the moon. ""The Martian""'s (hereafter ""Martian) protagonist, space botanist Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is absolutely right when he states ""Space Does Not Cooperate"". This becomes a problem when he is stranded alone on Mars like an interplanetary ""Robinson Crusoe"" (somewhat reminiscent of the 1964 film).Mark is part of the Ares III team also consisting of Commander Melissa Lewis (Jessica Chastain) and astronauts Rick Martinez (Michael Peña), Beth Johanssen (Kate Mara), Chris Beck (Sebastian Stan), and Alex Vogel (Aksel Hennie). While the Ares III team explores Mars, a blinding particle storm forces them to abort their mission and board their ship. The storm violently separates Mark from the rest of the crew who are forced to leave without him, believing Mark dead. The crew is so convinced he's dead that when they communicate that fact to NASA head Teddy Sanders (Jeff Daniels), he almost immediately arranges an honorary funeral for him.Of course, rumors of Mark's death are premature. Buried in sand, losing oxygen, and suffering a puncture wound, Mark is nevertheless alive. He manages to struggle back to the still-standing planet base, replenish air, equalize pressure, and treat his wound as best he can. However, the obstacles to his survival are just piling up. Can Mark fight Martian weather, radiation, cold, starvation, dehydration, and boredom at least long enough to somehow contact NASA to let them know he's alive, and then stay alive even longer for NASA to mount a rescue mission? Again, given that a one-way Earth-to-Mars trip takes four years, that's a daunting challenge.Meanwhile, back on Earth, Teddy, NASA spokesperson Annie Montrose (Kristen Wiig), and NASA mission directors Vincent Kapoor (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and Mitch Henderson (Sean Bean) have their own challenges, both urgent and mundane. Besides naturally getting Mitch home safely, Teddy and his team must negotiate the usual treacherous PR protocol to make sure that Mark's inadvertent abandonment does not embarrass, discredit, and eventually defund NASA. And meanwhile, back on Ares III heading back to Earth, the crew, especially guilt- ridden Commander Lewis, must decide, once NASA finally informs them, whether to continue home or return to rescue Mark, depending not only on whether they have enough fuel to do one or the other, but also on coordinating ship/Mars trajectory just right to get Mark.And so ""Martian"" oscillates among these three scenarios and dilemmas and manages, in my opinion, to do it without boring and, if you'll excuse the expression, alienating the audience. How can a space movie without aliens (even Marvin), laser weapons, or aerial combat hope to do this? I think ""Martian"" succeeds in this by being more knowledgeable than its audience, but in a way that instructs the audience without talking down to them. The movie explains many astrophysical, mechanical, and chemical concepts (including a crucial ""slingshot"" maneuver) that help keep the movie going forward and the audience invested in the characters' fates. It certainly helps that Damon's character Mark, in his daily video journal of his ordeals, explains much of this scientific stuff in largely (and often laugh-out-loud profane) layperson's terms.Furthermore, ""Martian"" reminds us that no national organization has a monopoly on knowledge. When NASA's attempt to send supplies in a booster rocket explodes into failure, they willingly ignore political tensions to contact chief scientist Guo Ming (Eddy Ko) and deputy chief scientist Zhu Tao (Chen Shu) at Chinese counterpart Chinese National Space Agency (CNSA) to help stabilize the payload. Ah, science rejects borders and embraces diversity. Finally, ""Martian"" uses science to ratchet up the intense suspense as Ares III does decide to go back to get Mark by plotting a trajectory and spacewalk, while Mark plots a rendezvous point and prepares a lightened space capsule and ""spacesuit propulsion"" system to hopefully get close enough to Ares III to grab him before his oxygen runs out.""Martian""'s intelligence also complements the convincing special effects, believably fallible but professional and determined characters (especially Mark), and the realistic depiction of the problems and triumphs of space agency bureaucracy and more importantly space exploration to make an absorbing and involving movie. Not least, ""Martian"" succeeds because it respects human intelligence and persistence so much, it convinces us that humanity will eventually surmount space's often deadly ""uncooperativeness"".P.S.: I saw this movie in the theater in 3D? Does 3D enhance the experience? In my opinion, it does to a slight degree, in the depiction of the Martian sandstorms and the flying spaceships. Yet, I felt it was largely unnecessary. Space's grandeur and infinite mystery come through even without the extra dimension.P.P.S.: I especially appreciated how Mark explained how planting crops (like potatoes on Mars) in a new land effectively colonizes that land, and how the distinction between international law and maritime law technically made him a ""space pirate"". Arrrrgh!"
321," A family movie
","Okay enough of the negative reviews. I don't know what's with people how miserable they are or want to be to not like a tinch of comedy in a movie? I mean, seriously?? Complaining about comedy in a movie? Don't you occasionally joke in your lives? If not, go see a doctor!It's definitely not a very accurate or 'how it should have been' movie, compared to something like Interstellar. But it is a great watch nonetheless. The less science in the scripts makes it a light family movie. Visuals are just amazing. Not all but some actors have done great work- Jessica Chastain and Sean Bean standout. And Matt is Matt."
322," It's great, but I wish it was more serious.
","It was surprisingly comedic film. I think most of humor don't fit in the film. As for everything other, the special effects were amazing. I loved when the film was about the survival of the martian, but after halfway through it started to drag, not suprising the lenght of it is 2h24min, I'd say 20 minutes too long. Still, I can recommend this film, the protagonist was great and I loved watching how he was trying to survive in mars."
323," The Martian is a must watch
","The Martian (2015) directed by Ridley Scott, is an adaptation of the novel by Andy Weir. The film stars Matt Damon as Mark Watney; Matt Damon's portrayal of the character was excellent as he clearly depicted the mental struggle of being left on a planet alone. You could see how Watney felt, the hope when things went right and the pain when everything was stacked against him, this added to the film by making the character multidimensional and truly adding a human aspect to space. The film also looks at many aspects of space travel, including the political and corporate side of space travel by showing how the commissions and the people at NASA dealt with finding out Watney was alive and how to move forward. This made the film even better as it allowed multiple aspects of the story to be examined and flushed out. The movie was very strong in how it showed the story from all angles, you could see Watney and his struggle, the crews processing the fact that Watney was alive and how NASA and the world dealt with the news of Watney. The film also excelled in its use of humor, the humor provided great contrast to the harsh reality of the film and really helped the film. There were also beautiful cinematic shots of mars that added to the film and provided great imagery as there was stark emptiness to mirror how alone Watney was, but also add a bit of irony as the beautiful place is very treacherous. The use of different camera shots added to the film, from the long cinematic views of mars, then the helmet cams, and the video ""diary"", all of these different techniques made the film come to life. All in all, the Martian features great acting, stunning cinematic work along with an excellent plot and is a must watch."
324," good movie
","I thought it was good. Typically, outside of Star Wars and
Marvel, l am not a sci-fi fan. I had to watch this at school, and
I didn't think l'd like it. But watching it, I thought it was good. It was really interesting, funny, and just good. You never knew what was going to happen. It was a really good film."

0," An experience you'll gonna remember forever.
","There is no way that I could describe my emotions for this movie. I'm totally speechless. I haven't laughed (even cried) this much in Marvel movie or even in any movie. I'm fully on my emotion, there are so many tears of joy and loss. Amazing story, the acting is outstanding, epic action, great CGI, the best storytelling ever told in a superhero movie, amazing performance. I love it more than 3000.Happiness, sadness, pure joy, excitement... I'm gonna miss this moment in my whole life because let's face it- it's been awhile movies can bring such a big enthusiasm like this.It is such an experience you'll gonna remember it forever. People are clapping, laughing, crying, full of a state emotion. It's 3 hours long but it went by like a finger snapping by Thanos, and now I'm thinking I'm actually in Quantum Realm because it felt like 5 seconds. Even though you know where the story is gonna bring you because it's still a 'superhero movie' but it left me speechless. It's not just a superhero movie, it's more than that.**SPOILER ALERT**Even some characters that you didn't like before, you will love them in this movie. Like Captain Marvel. I didn't like her before in her own movie but in Endgame they showed how powerful, how strong and how capable she really is. And now I kinda love her! But Marvel should really be careful of her line though, I didn't like some of her line like ""I'm the strongest"" and ""You didn't win because before you didn't have me"" duh. Also not gonna forget Hawkeye. To be honest, in Avengers I really didn't like Hawkeye because he's just a 'guy' with an arrow and just randomly showed up in any scene but actually he's character is so BADASS! Everything that we need, what we want is here.Also I don't get it why some people can not accept that Thor is fat or treat him like a joke. I mean, this movie might be trying to give us a message about no matter what 'shape' are you, you can be a hero and save the world. To be honest, I like what they did to Thor, that man is depressed and taking the most responsible after he missed the shot to kill Thanos in Infinity War. Even though he already did killed him but it's not gonna bring back his people of Asgard. Also he's God of Thunder for god sake, he could slap his stomach with thunder and got his abs back.I'm so happy too for Captain America. Finally he could do his dance with Peggy and I didn't expected that we could see the fight between Captain America with his own self. Also when Tony met his father really warm my heart, and we can see the 'real-life' Jarvis - I didn't expected that too.When the whole superhero arrived it is so EPIC! The whole person in theater are screaming and shocked. Gives me a goosebumps and still left me speechless!This movie is absolute perfection. The ending of this movie is we and the characters deserved. It gives a perfect balance for all these past 10 years. Epic and perfect ending, I was not disappointed at all. This movie was completely emotional and visually stunning. Now I get it why the Russo Brothers told us to do a Marvel Movie marathon before watching Endgame because this movie had everything to accomplish what left behind before all of this.Ready or not, whatever it takes.Go watch it for yourself."
1," They had no right to do that
","First review from me. This film deserves it. A superhero film, marvel or not, does not have the right to send me on the emotional rollercoaster that End Game did. It has no right to do what it did, paying tribute to 10 years of films whilst changing the rules as to what a superhero film should be.I laughed, lots.
I cried, lots.
I cheered (quietly and internally of course), lots
I even punched the air in a ""go on!"" during one sceneI can honestly say, no film has ever moved me like that. Hours later, my heart was still pounding, the adrenaline still flowing from this epic piece of film making.Made by fans, for fans. Are there flaws? Yes. If you over think the story of course there is. But it works. It flows. It fits.Go with it. Enjoy the ride.Soak up every second, it doesn't feel like 3 hours, it feels like a flow of story reaching a conclusion that will shock and move you.I have nothing else to say.10/10. Well done Russo brothers. Well done!Fans! Assemble!"
2," Amazing, but the more I dwell on it the worse it becomes
","I have to say, my first reaction walking out of the cinema was that it was great. Probably an 8/10. You know there's so much fan service in this movie and I particularly loved the ""I can do this all day"" CA line from one CA to another. It was almost Toy Story 2, enlightened Buzz to naive Buzz banter.I loved Clever Hulk, found Thor hilarious, though a bit annoying at times, and loved the references to past movies. Cap swinging Mjollnir around was beautiful.The deaths in this movie were also pretty surprising but I agree with some of the more balanced reviews in here that it was bizarre that so much time was spent on Hawkeye - does anyone really care about him? Not really.Killing off Black Widow was a surprising touch, but I, like many others, probably felt more of an emotional reaction to Banner's relationship with her and not Hawkeye (because no one actually cares about him). Renner, as an actor, just doesn't cut it much, unfortunately.The real problem with End Game, is the time travel. I don't know why any movie franchise would ever want to deal with time travel knowing how much grief it creates. Sure they try to explain everything with their hilarious conversation about movies, but in the end, there are just too many questions left at the end of the day, particularly when they already try to explain it through the Ancient One.The most glaring one of these is, if they change the past, they're changing another timeline, so how selfish is that? If Tony Stark snaps his fingers and kills Thanos, what happens to that original timeline? If he sent Thanos and everyone back, how does he magically know not to send Gamora back who is now stuck in 2023 - and so does that mean 2014 Quill never meets Gamora?!? What the hell? Essentially erasing the entire 2014 GOTG franchise in that universe. If Captain America goes back in time, he will inevitably change history in some way or another, so that is another timeline, right? So while everyone else's timeline is meant to stay the same in the present (as said by Stark) how does Cap end up sitting by the same lake as everyone else.There are also way too many questions about new timelines created - but perhaps that is intentional, such as the Loki TV show. But this is why I hate it when they bring time travel into any movie and just add stuff to it to make it wrap up nicely in their own universe.Also, don't get me started on how impossibly strong Thanos suddenly is without an infinity gauntlet? Even WITH the IG he couldn't stop Thor's Stormbringer, but now without the IG can easily defeat Thor with Stormbringer AND Mjollnir, Iron Man and Cap??? How convenient.I also think Marvel made a serious mistake creating Captain Marvel, how is she brought in as a convenient deus ex machina and yet doesn't really stick around to show off all her abilities, and she can't even defeat Thanos single handedly? Pfft. That was rich. She can barely prevent Thanos from snapping his fingers, yet in Infinity War, Cap was able to actually hold off his hand too? Bizarre parallels.So okay, sure, it was enjoyable to watch, but I just feel that there are too many plot inconsistencies creeping into End Game. There should have been better ways to get the infinity stones back, and I think someone stupid just thought time travel was the best way to do it,."
3," The End of an Era!
","After Avengers Infinity War, we waited for the Avengers Endgame. We wondered how the story would go on, how our heroes would turn back, what would be the end of Thanos. Many theories related to this have been put forward. Avengers Endgame was undoubtedly the most anticipated film of recent years. Normally, the higher the expectation, the higher the probability of disappointment. But this is not the case for Endgame. Whatever you're expecting, you find much more in the film. This means that the biggest concern about the film has disappeared.On the other hand, another comparison comes up. Is Endgame more successful than Infinity War? We can comfortably say it Avengers Infinity War is just the beginning of the story. Endgame was the finale of the story. So we shouldn't think of these two films as two separate stories. There is only one story divided into two parts.Avengers Endgame is, above all, a great homage to the ten-year history of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The story highlights the original Avengers team. Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow and Hawkeye are at the center of events. No character comes in front of them. Of course there are many characters that play an important role in the story outside the original Avengers team. Everyone's concern was that Captain Marvel, who was included in the Marvel world, overshadowed other heroes. We can say that this certainly did not happen. What is important in this struggle is not how strong you are, but how good you are. This comes to the fore in all areas. It gives good message about being a hero and a family.Of course, Avengers Endgame has some critical aspects. For example, is the three-hour period necessary in terms of the story? It can be discussed. The head of the story moves much slower than the rest. It also drags the heroes into an emotional predicament. Then the tempo is rising and the heavy scenes we are watching are getting more meaningful. The last 45 minutes of the movie is fully action packed. But the last 45 minutes goes so fast that you don't even realize it. Action and battle scenes are really successful. There is not even a slight distress about visual effects. There are also slight logic errors in the film, but in general the story is so successful that these details become meaningless and insignificant after a certain point.Lastly, Avengers Endgame doesn't have a movie end scene. Because after the film's final, there is no need for another scene. The Marvel legend Stan Lee appears with a small stage. But this is the last surprise scene in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Moreover, there is no clue about Marvel's future. This makes us wonder more about Spider-Man: Far from Home. 10/10"
4," The ending made all 22 movies worth it
","If you're going to watch this movie, avoid any spoilers, even spoiler free reviews.
Which is why I'm not going to say anything about the movie. Not even my opinion. All I'm going to say is:The crowd applauded 3 times during the movie, and stood up to clap their hands after. This I have never witnessed in a Dutch cinema. Dutch crowds aren't usually passionate about this. I checked the row where I was sitting, and people were crying. After the movie, I was seeing people with smudged mascara. That's all I have to say about the movie."
5," The writers got carried away, the directors over reached and the studio sacrificed the integrity of their product.
","I've just come from watching Endgame and I must say that I am disappointed.I loved Civil War and I loved Infinity War. When I came out of those films, I knew immediately that they were great and that I wanted to see them again. With Endgame, I'm not sure.I respect how they were prepared to show the consequences of what Thanos had done but by killing him off so quickly and then them having to do their own stone quest (hadn't we already seen Thanos doing this in IW) it felt slow and lazy. Worse still was that it felt very self-indulgent and attempting to be clever for clever sake.Like how Back to the Future II considered itself clever for showing the events of the first film but with Marty flitting around behind the scenes to ensure that it all still happened. I know it's meant to be fan pleasing but it really felt like a gimmick and lacking in confidence. Almost like it was saying 'Hey guys, this will make you smile'. If you want to make me smile, concentrate on maintaining the quality of your product rather than directly trying to make me like you.But the trouble with messing around with timelines and bouncing around is that it makes the audience start asking questions during the film. The linearity that we'd seen in IW and the imminent fast approaching threat is replaced in Endgame with a lack of direction and characters that are earlier versions of who the audience have seen.In IW we were shown Thanos. He was written to be sympathetic or at least a character that we the audience could understand. He believed in what he was doing and this made him more rounded. But in Endgame, that version is dispatched quickly and we are supplied with a 2014 (?) Thanos who isn't the character we know but is just a token bad guy.This Thanos hasn't made the sacrifice at Vormire, he isn't the guy that would empathise with Scarlet Witch for what she did to Vision. He has suddenly become a token cut out evil bad guy that needs to be defeated. Hell, the writers even manage to forget their own time loop by saying that this Thanos has learnt that he doesn't want to wipe out 50% anymore because they are too ungrateful. How does he know this when the 2014 Thanos has only just literally arrived in the post wipeout Universe? How has he had time to form the opinion that his previous quest for a 50% cull isn't worthy?Is this a case of the writers being terrified that they had created a bad guy that people related to or was it a fear that they'd written themselves into a hole? Why go to the effort of creating that character in IW to suddenly kill him off at the beginning of Endgame just for a dramatic punch?For me, the time travelling and stone gathering wasted time to create unimportant scenes that fundamentally undermine the films that came before.
In my opinion it would have been better if they had shown the remaining Avengers preparing to do some Avenging and maintained the single minded linearity of IW of battling towards and reaching a post click Thanos and somehow reversing his work.The more I think of the film, the more plot holes and frustrations manifest themselves. Thor's drinking and man child antics might have been initially funny but one begins to realise that they are deliberately doing this to clip his wings. Likewise with Hulk, his primordial desire to smash and destroy has been removed to think it out and he has become an embarrassing shadow of his former self.The thing that is meant to be amazing about the MCU is the world building but inconsistencies have been appearing and there are so many in Endgame that it makes you question whether these two films are written by the same people.In IW, Thanos is a dangerous and credible threat because he has the infinity stones. He takes on half of the Avengers, Strange and some of the Guardians on Titan and smashes them and then takes on the other half on Wakanda and smashes them. Yet it is Stormbreaker (whose creation we have seen been hard earned by a motivated Thor) that has the power to take down Thanos even when he has a full complement of Infinity Stones.Yet we roll forward to Endgame and we have literally all the good guys together in one place, Cap with his shield, Tony fully powered up, Scarlet Witch p*ssed and vengeful, Capt Marvel who can seemingly do anything and Thor wielding both Mjolnir AND Stormbreaker and Thanos NOT in possession of the gauntlet, yet they can't defeat him.It's like the fights in IW were so amazing because the good guys were taking on an unbeatable foe yet here he is now seemingly defeatable by the 'rules' that the writers established . A good example of this would be in IW when Cap is the last man standing before Scarlet Witch and he grabs the gauntlet. You see the look of admiration/respect on Thanos' face that Cap is holding open the gauntlet before he punches him to the ground yet now that scene seems pointless.The writers for Endgame seem to have been driven to undo everything they did in IW. All the tension, all the sacrifice, all the development of Thanos discarded for well, I don't know what. It makes no sense.IW had two incredible scenes that used to choke me up. When Cap appears in the train station, the Avengers theme kicks in and Falcon and Widow take down the henchman in a wonderfully choreographed scene. In just that one scene it shows them coming to the rescue, it shows how intuitively they work together and it showcases their heroism.Likewise when Thor creates Stormbreaker and makes his entrance on Wakanda, I felt it for the journey that Thor has been on. He's had to contend with loss and defeat and humiliation and this is his redemption. Here is a character that has earned his game changing weapon and when he arrives and demands to face a character that everyone else is running away from, I want to punch the air.But in Endgame, that feels like it has to be corrupted. We can't have Thor being dominant, let's break him and make him a fool. We can't have Thanos being complicated and relatable, let's make him a cut out bad guy. We can't have Hulk being rage fuelled and smashing stuff up, let's make him more sensitive and talking stuff out. We can't have Cap being stoic and heroic, let's have him ridiculing one of his own iconic lines in a silly gimmicky fight with himself and commenting on his butt. We can't have a powerful female character that we're invested in look sexy AND be able to take down Thanos, let's give Scarlet Witch a small part but focus our attention on a female character that hasn't earnt our admiration or desire for revenge.To be honest, the 'rules of engagement' had been set so well in IW that when in Endgame Thanos massed his ranks against the Avengers and then ALL of the good guys showed up, I was almost expecting the camera to pull away and not show the fight given that it was so obviously going to be an easy win for the good guys.And as for the big fight scene, it did reek of what DC always manage to do which is just throw everything into an end battle and bludgeon you with CGI and pyrotechnics so that you aren't really sure what is going on.In the many fights in IW, you knew what was going on, you recognised the combatants, you understood the stakes and you identified the geography of the scene. In Endgame we got one big massive fight where everything was thrown in the pot and it was just assumed by the directors that we would be happy with all the flashing lights.
And I have to say that considering that Steve and Tony fell out so hard, and that Tony's criticism of Steve was so unfair, that I really had hoped for more than just a handshake, a muttering of 'no worries' and 'here's your shield'. These guys wrote and directed Civil War, they created the line 'we fell out hard' and hence I had hoped for something deeper and more touching than a handshake.Steve wrote Tony a letter telling him that when he needed him he'd be there but once again the Iron Man bias had to creep in and once again Tony was the victim and the ultimate hero.But I think my biggest problem is how the convenient time travelling undermines everything. When a franchise starts retrofitting stuff (like Fury's eye being from a space cat), it's then hard to consider the previous stories.Having 2014 Gamorra means that all the evolution that we saw her go through in GOTG 1 and 2 is wasted. Having Cap marry Peggy means the pain of his sacrifice, him seeing her in Winter Soldier when she is suffering from Alzheimer's, hell even his blossoming relationship with Sharon Carter is kinda irrelevant. Having seen Thor at last step away from his two weaker origin films into the entertainment of Ragnarok and the redemption in IW leaves us now with a bumbling buffoon.We know that what makes Captain America what he is, is the serum that makes him a super soldier. That he was transformed from a weakling to a superhuman. Sam Wilson is not a super soldier and he didn't take the serum. He is Falcon. Now maybe in the comics he becomes Cap but Bucky is a super soldier. Is the new Cap going to foil an evil plot and be defeated with a tazer or a knife to the chest? Consider the beatings that Steve has taken and the physical strength that he has shown we can recognise that Sam Wilson does not have that.I'm sorry to say but the Russo's have dropped the ball. Themselves and their writers have succumbed to their success and their desire to be engineers of political correctness and social change. I thought Endgame would be the high soaring end to this 10 year run of impressive movie entertainment but in the end the writers got carried away, the directors over reached and the studio sacrificed the integrity of their product for a chance to 'educate' us all. A real shame and a wasted opportunity.Infinity War is clearly the highlight of the last 10 years but even now I fear that repeated viewings will render it pointless considering how the makers decided to fundamentally damage it."
6," Undewhelming and Overhyped
","Endgame is a much less interesting and visually engaging movie than Infinity War. I don't understand all the crazy hype and 8.8 on imdb is stupid, this is why I'm giving it one star, to mitigate the stupidity.As everyone expected, remaining avengers use time travel to try to fix things, yet even for a marvel movie the time travel science is confusing and ridiculous, as well as shown in a very boring way. I've seen low budget movies that had better grasp on the scientific, logical and visual aspect of time travel.The whole point of endgame is to resurrect the fallen avengers and other trillions of creatures across the galaxy, yet while doing it avengers end up losing irrevocably even more important members of the team, and the whole thing looks ill-conceived.A lot of time is spent on meaningless conversations, while the devastation Thanos caused across the galaxy is barely shown, negating the past and current sacrifices of avengers.I left Infinity War wanting to see how the story ends.
I left Endgame feeling that I should've waited for it to come out on Netflix."
7," Dug themselves a hole they couldn't get out of...
","First of, Infinity War was the greatest MCU movie ever made IMHO.Of course, following it up was never going to be easy, and it's sheer greatness and the impact of the 'snap' was something that the Russos just couldn't navigate a way out of. However, plot difficulties aside, there was really no excuse for some of the poor character treatment and pacing issues that they had.Positives:
RDJ's actingNatasha and Hawkeye's last interactionsCGINegatives:
Abysmally poor treatment of Thor, reduced to a comic relief sideshowAbysmally poor treatment of the Hulk - One of the strongest characters of the MCU didn't fight more than 10secs in the 2 supposedly landmark movies of the MCU??Completely ruined Thanos - reduced to a caricature 'bad guy' after an excellently built character in IWPoor re-introduction of the vanished Avengers - seems most of the team wasn't even paid and they just used some stock footage from previous movies for their blink and you miss appearancesWasted potential of Capt Marvel - why introduce a character so powerful, and then not use them for >95% of the movie?Pacing - all over the place. Could easily have trimmed the fat and achieved a much more coherent productMore of a Cap+Stark movie than an Avengers movie.Time travel plotholes - hellloooo. I was OK with the main plan of stealing, snapping, restoring the stones. Hell, I am even OK with Cap getting the happy ending (assuming he stays in hiding his entire life and Carter's life decisions are not affected by the guy in her basement). But as soon as Thanos goes to the future and dies there, Uh Oh - did we just lose the entire Infinity War?? Maybe I am too dumb to understand this...In the end, while the homage to the movies and characters was fine, I really wanted to have a movie I would rush to watch again (Like I did with IW). Sadly, they couldn't deliver this time."
8," Disney Light plot with predictable old values agenda
","The last Avengers ended with a philosophically valid dilemma. Stop the overpopulation of all worlds by halving the population in the universe in order to save humans and other species. The only mention of environment in Endgame was Captain America stating ""a pod of whales was seen in the Hudson, if you want to look at the bright side"" to which Black Widow replies ""I will throw this sandwich at you"". Yup, that's as deep as that conversation went. Immediately they were back to the tired old 'save humanity from evil Thanos' plot. The world is portrayed as a complete shambles with Thanos' reduced population measures. It would have been far more interesting to show the positive changes of having fewer people in the richness of the planet, thriving of other species as well as our own. But no, that is completely ignored and the ecosystem crushing population returns. Very generic plot, disappointing."
9," Should have been called Avengers: meh
","3hrs of zooming around jumping through time, with stops for flat emotional diatribes . Then an end battle where the actors who are retiring were given a story exit. Blah blah. At least 'infinity war' had more laughs and a few nerdgasm scenes like Thor arriving in wakanda. End game looks and feels like a money extraction excercise . Perhaps they should have made this into a trilogy with part one thanos winning (2hrs), part 2 all about the emotional distress and how messed up things are (2hrs), then part 3 how they sort stuff out (2hrs). A bit like the first star wars trilogy . Overall meh"
10," Seriously?!
",Man what a let down after Infinity War. Virtually no action in a superhero movie. Predictable plot with lame time warping around all over the place. And what in God's name did you do with Thor's character after the last movie holy crap! So glad I didn't waste my time in a theater for this one.

12," Have fun and forget immeaditely
","I am huge sf lover but i never liked hollywood superhero movies except maybe (nolan batman trilogy) because there is no suspense when you know in advance who will win. would you like to watch football match knowing the result in advance?secondly i don't like this ""back to the past"" cheat card. so every time you end up dead or don't like the outcome you can go into past undo things, bring dead back to life and change the present. so basically ""endgame"" isn't the end, if ""bad"" guys also can also travel back in time? ok, i know this film targeted teenager audience and cannot be to dark or too complex (like real life is). film was fun, but it would be much better if they didn't use this lame trick going into past after half of the characters ended up dead in previous film."

","The whole plot in this installment of Avengers hinges on a rat that just so happens to touch a button, in a van...Also, time traveling always ruins a movie.

14," 3 hours of movie: 90% a waste of your time and 10% of some good action, that's it
","I had no choice but to watch it to finish the sequence. The worst of all the Avengers movies. Apart from some action scenes all the rest it is pure lame dialogues and poor performances.
Purely made to make money out of a ""trendy"" public that are rating this movie high because I've never met one single person who has read the comics and like this garbage.

","As others have said time travel is always a cop out, but there seem to be some major problems with it's use here, first is the fates of black widow and gamora, we are told (by the writer in the bluray commentary) that black widow can't be brought back because the fate of obtaining the soul stone can't be undone, yet gamora seems to have undone here fate from the same choice. The small point that if gamora never made the choice due to the time travel, then in fact none of the events in the previous could never have happened as Thanos would have been one stone short seems to be ignored.
Then you have Captain America's fate, he time travels back and lives out his days as agents Carters secret husband, cool. Unfortunately this then means that within the MCU universe He also has a reactionship with agent 13, technically his own great niece, whoops."

31," Terrible Ending to a 22 movie Arc
","I want to start out saying I love all the Marvel movies leading up to Endgame. I loved Infinity War because it seemed to be setting up a terrific conclusion to the original 6 Avengers story arc's. I was very wrong. Let's start with Tony's Arc. In Ironman 1 Tony is told you are a man who has everything and nothing. In Ironman 2 we find out his dad was distant and cold to him, and in ironman 3 he is getting panic attacks because he thinks it's up to him to save the world from all threats. So in Endgame he finally gets everything that's important. He becomes a Dad and husband and... was proven right by having to die saving the universe himself? Why? Because we are supposed to believe Tony can't retire? Of course he can. Didn't he say to Steve in AoU ""isn't that why we fight so we can end the fight? So we can go home?"" Tony wanted to retire. Tony's arc should have been about being a good dad like his father never was and finally becoming the man who has everything important. He should have learned that he doesn't have to do it all on his own. Team work should have won the final battle. What's the point of finally getting all the Avengers together if it's left to one man to sacrifice himself to save everyone? Tony's ending was not satisfying and it was not the end they have been building towards from the beginning. Now let's talk about the real tragedy in this movie. Steve Rogers character. We know he is a good man who always does what he believes is right. He calls Home the Avengers facility and says he can't ignore a situation that's headed south. He loved Peggy but found out she had gotten married and had a happy life and he tried moving on with her niece. This storyline was ignored which was ok because most of Steves storyline in the MCU has been about saving Bucky. You remember him right? Steve didn't seem to for the entire movie. Instead of thinking about Sam and Bucky and all the people they are going to save if their plan works when they find Thanos in the beginning of Endgame Steve's just looking at the Peggy compass that he hasn't looked at in at least 3 movies. Why? So we can all forget about his actual character development and think it's a great ending when he goes back in time to be with Peggy. I'm just going to ignore all the plot holes associated with Steve going back in time and just focus on the character assasination this commits. This means the same guy who says he can't ignore a situation headed south, who never ran away from a fight, who said I'm with you till the end of the line"" to Bucky is just going to live out his life in the past never saving his friend from being a brain washed assassin, never saving his other friends parents from being killed by his best friend, never stopping any of the thousands of bad things he would know are going to happen? That's not Steve. The writers never let Steve get a personal life. He never found someone after Peggy and he never had anything except the Avengers. He was the one that was set up to die. The final battle starts with what is probably the most epic scene in comic book movie history but fizzles our soon after. Doctor Stranges plan makes no sense. How was this the only way they could win? Why couldn't Captain Marvel snap? Why couldn't captain Marvel just fly the gauntlet to another galaxy? Why couldn't Doctor Strange open a portal and drop the gauntlet on some random planet? In Infinity War why didn't Doctor Strange use his portal to go to Wakanda and tell Thor to aim for the head. The characters powers were very inconsistent for the first time in the MCU. Why was Thanos with no infinity stones able to fight Mjolnir and Storm Breaker but Thanos with all 6 stones would have lost to Storm Breaker if Thor would have just aimed for the head? Why can Captain Marvel fly through a huge spaceship 10 times but she gets knocked out after one punch from Thanos? Why does no one attack Thanos at the same time as someone else? Where's the big team up? You would think getting everyone together for the first time would have been the only way to defeat Thanos, but you'd be wrong because it's all about Tony stark. Even Steve picking up Mjolnir means nothing really because it has no affect on the end of the battle. Thor and Steve could be taken out of this movie and nothing would change. They do nothing of importance. This movie seems so disconnected from Infinity War that it's boggles my mind how this movie has the same writers and directors as Infinity War and it was filmed at the same time as Infinity War. How can you get one so wrong and the other so right? It seems clear to me that the writers and directors decided that Tony was dying and Steve was going back to the past no matter how much their story suffered from doing it. It's like they had a check list of things to put in the movie without actually making a good story that fit in with the rest of their movies. This is by far the most dissapointing ending to anything I've ever looked forward to."
32," Very disappointing
","Overated, boring nonsense! Infinity war set me up for what I thought was going to be the best marvel movie ever but end game felt like it was trying too hard to please everyone! Instead of just being a really good marvel movie.
The plot holes were a big part of the disappointment for me."
33," non-sense
","Cheap dialogs, non sense violence. The only thing the movie has to offer is explosions. Is it really that hard to make quality superhero movies? Look at Christopher Nolan's series of Batman movies, those are quality films. This movie is flat, it can be consumed as fast food, nothing to offer really"
34," Way too long, over-melodramatic, incomprehensible
","Too bad there isn't a zero star rating. I am not the target demo, was dragged to the movie theater by my young son to see it (he thought the movie was OK. I didn't.1. Lots of nothing much happens
2. Lots of melodramatic music
3. The movie at 182 minutes is about 82 minutes too long
4. The Thor character ceases to become comic amusement about a third through the pic
5. Incomprehensible and repeated fight scenes
6. Exceptionally poor dialog in the screenplayVisually the only star turns were Brie Larson and Elizabeth Olsen. The Scarlet Witch, one of the stronger themes was barely in this - Olsen should get her own movie.I was three hours of my life back plus $68 bucks spent on tickets and popcorn at AMC."
35," Most overhyped overrated movie ever
","This movie dosent deserve to be this high on IMDb,it was bring and by far the worst avengers movie with a disapointing and predictable outcome,it ruined thanos and the heroes one with no casualties like every superhero movie,endgame was by far the worst most overrated marvel movie"
36," The time travel is a joke
",There are so many nonsense point in this movie. Wasted my 3hrs. I'm very very DISAPPOINTED.
37," You're joking right?
",This movie was a terrible mess from start to finish.
38," must be a marvel universe fan to like it
","I managed to watch 40 minutes of this crap, and then could not stand it any longer. You must be a true fan of Marvel Universe to see it until the end. If you are not, avoid - nothing makes sense in this utterly boring movie. Acting is really bad too. High-end special effects cannot save it."
39," Already know whats gonna happen.
","I dont see why people think its that great. We already know whats gonna happen. They just copy it from the comics. You want a good superhero movie. Make the movie first, then the comic book. It will save time and money."
40," Long and boring
","I don't mind long movies, but they should be interesting. The story of this one could have been written by any 10 year old. What are story-writers getting paid for these days?"
41," What a waste of 3 hours of my life!
","Last week I wasted 3 hours of my life watching the latest Avengers movie End Game. I am a massive Marvel fan and have loved most of the movies up to now. Lots of action and fun. What has gone wrong. I was looking forward to this film so much but was so disappointed. If you want action and fun go watch John Wick 3, Wow that is a film especially compared to this dribble.Were do I start. At the start, or should I say for the first 30 min all the characters are depressed and feeling sorry for themselves. Then they mention time travel, yes time travel. I mean after all Marvels great films and ideas the best they could come up with to get things back to normal was time travel. What next, Ironman (Robert Downey Jr) wakes up back in Ironman 1 and the last 20 years have all been a dream aka Dallas style. Come on give me a break the best they could come up with was time travel. Anyway 1 1/2 hours into the film I turned to my friend and said the last 1 1/2 hours must be amazing as this has been so boring and all the reviews say this is a great movie. To my disappointment it did not get much better. In the 3 hours of running time there is at a push 30 minutes of action and that is at a push. The rest is just a load of rubbish.So disappointed, won't be wasting my hard earned money on Marvel again."
42," Is this a joke?
","This must be one of the most ridiculous movies I have ever seen.
They tried to create humor, sadness but it was just pathetic."
43," high tech magic creatues with low tech lowlifes
","Just watched this in fast-forward.
i simply cannot digest this universe where in one hand high tech space travel magic creatures are living along with dump low tech planetlings , so i guess that the majority of the fans are identifying them self to those lowlifes. and the most irritating for me is how low modern they dress them self in this marvel universe."
44," Complete Drag
",My 9 year old after 30 mins of watching asked me if we were in the right theater. It went worse from there.
45," Non Sense time travel
","In the movie they say that the time travel will not affect the past?! How is that possible?
Thor even stole the hammer from his past!!!
He left him without a hammer!!!!Hulk basically he didn't have any fight! He did not even got revenge from the last time he fought with thanos.Captain Marvel could just have killed the Thanos without the stones all by herself!"
46," Pure torture
","I had to take several breaks, walk the dogs, play videogames and clean the house, while watching this absolutely ridiculous and nonsensical pile of rubbish and now afterwards, I'm asking myself why I put myself through such suffering. To what end. I guess I was hoping there would be one scene or at least one line that put a smile on my face or made me feel anything at all except extreme pain and boredom. There wasn't any of that unfortunately, so I just wasted three hours of my life I could have spent on basically anything else and it would have been more worth while. I can't decide which one was more painful to watch, this or Aquaman? Both equally and utterly disappointing I guess."
47," 3 hours of simplistic drama, tensionless fight scenes & cgi explosions
","One of the most overrated and overhyped movies of 2019, filed with plot holes, subpar acting, simplistic drama, tensionless fight scenes and a ton of CGI explosions."
48," Sooooo boring!!
",I loved all the other movies..but I'm not sure I can even finish watching this...3hours of not getting to the damn point already...
49," Time to accept that there's a new generation.
","It was a fairly entertaining film for the first couple of hours (probably worth a 6 or 7), with a few exceptions, - not least the abomination of making Thor a fat drunken slob.
Then it slowly became apparent that this was all about shedding the old traditional heroes (as originally written) and replacing them with politically correct versions as per the recent trend.
I'm sure it will appeal to enough millennials to make tons of money, but I suspect that this is where I get off.
If the PC brigade want ethnic minority and female heroes, - why not create new ones instead of corrupting the original stories.
Until they add a White (or Black) Widower, male Captain Marvel (as per the original stories) or a white panther, etc., for balance.
Which, I'm guessing, is no time soon."
50," Russo bros missed the mark!
","What they did to Hulk and Thor was disgusting. The best action Hulk had was handing tacos to Antman. They turned him into taco Tuesday Hulk with no redemption or rematch for Thanos.Fat alcoholic self pity Thor was not funny and for a demi god he turned out to be league bowler from crap town Ohio. Appalling and gross! Oh, support group Cap was another miss. They turned the women into men and the men into women straight up Hollywood style. 👎👎"
51," Not in the same league as Infinity War -Boring Zzzz
","Infinity War by far the best Marvel by a long way. However Endgame half the film was boring and only the last 10 minutes had an resembles to Infinity war.Thick Thor, Professor Hulk brilliant the rest average."
52," what did i just watch ?
","Time machine was the worst idea ever. I couldn't even understand every inch of the stories, it make no sense to me."
53," Total Rubbish
","I watch probably 1 movie on an average every week from last 3 years and have watched a lot of boring movies but this is the first time I could not watch a movie to the end
Can't be more boring movie then this"
54," A true wonderfully executed fraud.
","I do not like marvel films, because forced comedy is not how you make films.
I liked infinity war because of thanks, a very decent villian.
When comes to endgame, it is a fraud, emotions without reasons and are they not the avengers, they avenge. Right!
I saw the trailer and thought this is gonna be a film where avengers are gonna shine. But all that suit up, training was for time travel to see their younger selves and parents.
An 8 year old will be able to write that outline.
By far the biggest disappointment by marvel, it has turned itself into the new transformers franchise. The only thing they are better at apart from the money is, paying off critics and websites to mislead by positive reviews."
55," Really bad and embarrassing movie
","They ruined all the great superhero in this movieThe hullk??? -Wtf its a joke
Ironman- not great fight scene and usless death
Thor -is like crying baby
Captian america -can hold thor hammer??? Really??
Its like the ending of game of the throne"
56," Terrible movie
","So predictable. There is nothing is this movie that explains people liking it. Just horrible, waste of time."
57," Boring
",Boring rehashed rubbish. Too long! Too many characters again!! Seen it all before and now I am bored of Marvel and DISNEY!!!!
58," not good
",Story not good .. that's way i don't like this type of move.
59," Utter letdown and a disgrace to everything that preceded it
",Endgame was hands down the worst entry in the Marvel cinematic universe. I've had random bouts of depression ever since i saw this film. It ruined so many of the films that preceded it i have no words. Zero stars if i could.
60," Typical bad superhero film
","I cant believe people think this is 8.8, in a normal world this film is around 6, Infinity war is around 7, and some teenagers watch this at the cinemas and no one remembers it after a month."
61," PLODDED ALONG LIKE AN OLD MULE
","So many others have captured how I felt about this movie, that regurgitating what they said would lessen their impact. So all I want to say is that this movie was slow, disjointed, badly executed in writing and a complete disappointment. Even my 9 year old grandson said it sucked. Sad...."
62," IT CAN'T BELONG MARVEL
","It is the worst scenario ever . How could you defeat the most powerfull character in the marvel universe as he is child ? And All of the logic errors ?? Making Infinity War :

2-Oh no ! we can't get money without them we have to save them !
3-Save them with silly time machine or incredible things
4-Show off them for 10 minutes .
4-Repeat"
63," Plot Holes/ Forced Drama/ Ruined Characters
","-spoilers!--Iron man had to go talk to his dad in the past, Thor had to talk to his mom, Hawkeye got to go see his old dead girlfriend.. How convenient that all the stones were in the past directly next to the main characters loved ones. Nobody had to go hundreds of years in the past or anything? Nope all the stones were just a generation away hanging out with your parents so you could go reconnect with them and get emotional.-Tons of plot holes with time travel. We were told it creates a split in the timeline when they time travel, creating a whole new timeline. Sooo.. What happened to the old timeline they left behind to go back in time to defeat Thanos? Does this mean there is a timeline where all the superheroes abandoned the world to go back in time? And at the end when Captain America went back in time, shouldn't it have created a new timeline for him as well? Instead of him being able to meet up with them when he was old? Although this doesn't bother me as much as the other point of this review, it did make the story feel a little hollow and vague.-Felt like there was only 1 single battle sequence in this movie. Aren't there usually a few smaller battles before the final epic one? It was like 2.5 hours of drama and feelings and ""oh I miss my mom"" and only about 12 minutes of good fighting. The fighting was also so cut up, trying to give every hero a great cameo, that no fight scene lasted longer than 10 seconds without being cut. Even after Iron man gives Thanos a long pre-fight speech it only shows about 2 seconds of fighting before they cut away.-They kill Thanos in the beginning super easily, no effort, kinda upsetting. This made the entire previous movie feel like a waste. (even though it was a much better movie)-The Hulk made me cringe. They've changed his character so drastically he's not even the hulk anymore. He doesn't get angry, he doesn't regenerate (either does Captain in this movie), he doesn't smash. He's always in green form. They explain all of the above with, oh I shot myself with some gamma rays. THEN LATER WHEN HE PUTS ON THE GLOVE THEY SAY THE HULK IS PRETTY MUCH IMMUNE TO GAMMA RAYS?! Ugh. He also mentions how he was trying to fight the hulk, but then he realized the hulk is the cure. What is he the cure to if he cant regenerate anymore? I miss the old Edward Norton Hulk to be completely honest.-Personally, I hated Captain Marvel. I hate the actor, I hate the character, I hate her vague god like powers, I hate how she randomly shows up in this movie even though she wasn't in any of the others. I hate how she only shows up for a few minutes in the beginning and a few seconds at the end.-Literally the best scene in the movie is at the very end, when Thor and StarLord are arguing about who's in charge of the ship."
64," Monumentally disappointing. Also Joe Russo gets cast as the gay extra in his own movie.
","As a huge fan of marvel I can say that the characters I know and love that I expected to see in the grand finalé of a 22-movie saga, where nowhere to be found. Fat Thor was played off for jokes too much. Captain America was more Thor than actual Thor. Professor hulk was just a boring character. Thanos was nothing like how he was in the infinitely superior ""Infinity War"". Time travel rules was just cheap writing. An easy way out of a complex predicament crafted by two people with minimal creative abilities. The plot was littered with holes and just boring. This movie was not exciting. One of my biggest problems was the stupid one-liners and cheap jokes. This movie was not meant to be funny. There is room for humor, but there also needs to be room for plot and suspense and seriousness. Another of my biggest problems was cap lifting mjolnir. I have no problem with him lifting it. But it was anti-climactic. Good idea, but butchered in execution. I don't say this lightly or out of arrogance or vanity, but I, as a 15 year old kid could have created a better movie. Also, the greatest part of the film: Joe Russo got cast as the gay extra in his own movie."
65," Time machine? Seriously?
","I feel they ran out of ideas, and BANG time machine is the solution. They should have prepared themselves for the end before that. for example in sherlock holmes "" the series"" they prepared for the season final ""the Final Problem"",, 2 seasons before it, saying words or giving hints that something is going to happen. I was really disappointed with this movie."
66," Terrible
","The simple fact of the matter is, you f#cked this up! Everyone loves a plot twist, not a kaleidoscope of ridiculous smashed together story plots that have no direction. You sold us a lemon and from the looks of it, you dont even feel bad about it. Point in question. Captain Marvel is looking after thousands of other planets....... is Thanos on those planets???? No. Hawkeye has a hair cut half way though the movie and then grows it back in the next scene. Why isnt Gamora in the end shots? How did none of the Avengers notice and old man sat on the bench before Steve Rodgers went back in time? Pepper Potts could turn her body into malten liquid but now she seems to have forgotten that little life slip up and so has gone for a suit that looks suspectly like the Wasps. Thanos held Thors bloody axe!!! Is he worthy?? This film surely isnt"
67," I wish the time travel was real...
","So I could go back and stop myself from seeing this film! ""Infinity War"" was a masterpiece compared to this. Marvel please undo the 181 minutes of my life!Earlier we could count at least on some action scenes in Marvel movies. Not today Thanos! There is barely any action in the movie and the CGI they used in fights was extremely low quality and painful to watch. Even some basic fights and tricks were not choreographed by actors but made of a cheap looking, crappy CGI. This is unacceptable for such a budget.The story is so bad even a 5-yo child could write better. Some people are sobbing for AGES (I do understand a pain of loss but come on aren't you called superheroes for a reason?) Other people just appear out of nowhere doing their things with no explanation whatsoever. How in the world did this garbage get 9\10 rating is a mystery. I guess it's a real Endgame..."
68," Men are included for comedy
","So bad. Oh so bad. The estrogen in this one is nauseating. Only one Avenger is a figure in the mythology of white people- Thor, and it is the one that must be turned into a blubbering fat wuss as a result. I tried to get through it but I really couldn't.Movies these days- so bad. Oh so bad."

70," One movie to bore them all
","My 10 year old nephew LOVES super heroes and he's watched all Marvel and DC movies, but after 30+ minutes into this one he says: ""This movie is no good. We are wasting our time"".I couldn't agree more. We forced ourselves to continue watching though, maybe it would get better. It didn't. At times we both laughed at how bad it was.The 10 year old who (again) LOVES super hero movies suddenly stopped watching while there was still 40 minutes left, he just went out to play instead. At this point I couldn't care less of how things turned out at the end so I just turned it off prematurely.Just an indication of how failed this movie was, in our opinion."
71," Where's the cheese?!
","I'm extremely disappointed as it didn't have any cheese in the film and the film simply wasn't British enough. Thor and Loki's lovely accents were the only redeeming qualities, the rest was just terrible as i had to sit through 3 entire hours of annoying barely understandable accents with no cheese to get my love balls stirring. Afterwards I had to have several pints of tea to cheer me up, don't waste your money on this Britons."
72," Why the hype?
","While I respect the fans going ga ga and people discussing the emotions etc, I beg to differ. I saw this movie yesterday after all the rush had died out. There were about 25-30 people in the Audi having seating capacity of approx 250.Pace: The buildup is slow and boring.Emotions: Forced and sometimes looks very artificial. You don't feel a thing. When some people said that they cried, I wonder for what. Action: It comes late and is limited. I expected more (isnt that expected in the avengers movies?)CGI: Was good.Storyline: Very weak. It could have been refined. Many of the characters were inserted and wasted.Length: It was unnecessarily prolonged, esp towards the end. They could have reduced the runtime by 20-30 minutes.Overall: Bad. Barely a one time watch, with lots of patience. The studios have created the hype and made their money. The previous avenger movie was way better. This one was a totally let down, just like the Game of Thrones final season."
73," Killed all the other movies, big deception.
","1- Time machine = insane amount of plot holes
2- Unrealistic overpowered Thanos without the gems... illogical AF.
3- Characters decisions specially in Thanos combat were dump and had no logic.
4- Weak plot, it seems like the avenguers didn't learn anything from the past movies.
5- Too much forced drama and fillers.
For me it´s a 5 star movie, but i gave 1 due the immense amount of 10´s."
74," Marvel Studios drops the ball Again
","What have they done wrong with this movie ""everything""
They have turned Thor & Hulk into joke characters the whole movie feels hurried and confusing the CGI is poor on more than one occasion a lot of MCU characters are more cameos than necessary.I enjoyed the early Marvel movies but the most recent ones are ruining the franchise how they made so much £££ out of this is baffling it only gets more confusing the longer you watch it.I am not sure why so many cameos were necessary as Captain Marvel was all that was needed."
75," Melodramatic Superhero movie
","This is what happens when movies start taking themselves too seriously. What's with all the emotional drama scenes in a movie about flying hammers and talking raccoons? Why are these superheroes so weak and human? Thor the GOD of Lightning is reduced to an alcoholic pot bellied homeless man by the writers and it takes away from the potency of the character. The plot is unoriginal, lazy and uninspiring. They've run out of ideas. AVOID."
76," I wanted to like it. I really did. But it was boring.
","If you like special effects then you will like this movie. If you like a good, intriguing, believable story with interesting characters then this movie may be very lacking in that department. The characters with all their interesting super powers just seemed to be a bore. Perhaps this sort of thing happens when you have too many main characters in one movie. There is no character development. One thing there is no shortage of is good looking special effects but it merely covers up the inadequacy of any kind of substance in the story lines and characters.The story totally contradicts itself. I'm not going to post spoilers in this review but in the end it really looked like the writers just made up unrealistic stuff that did not make any sense or had any sort of believable realism. If you tell a story like a 3 year old, other 3 year olds are going to love your story but adults are going to be bored to tears.They turned almighty Thor into a 3 year old, with mannerisms, intellect and all the traits 3 year olds display. But here we go again with Hollywood trying to emasculate men in all their latest block busters. Political nonsense that seems to be infecting and infesting big budget movies... It really just makes the world of Hollywood look all the more plastic.Perhaps the extremely high rating of this movie made me expect something really good and entertaining but all the enthusiasm I had soon turned in boredom and mild resentment because 3 hours is a lot to spend on something that seemed to bring only boredom."

","It's hard to believe that this is the highest grossing movie of all time. It's not even that good of a Marvel movie.I understand that this is based on a comic book characters but damn! The fact that this movie is so successful is pretty much the reason why Hollywood thinks they can get away making movies that aren't all that well thought out but look cool.

84," Not as good as everyone says

85," A huge disappointment
","After just finishing watching each of the marvel movies in chronological order so everything was fresh in my mind I was anxiously anticipating this movie. I couldn't have been more disappointed. I would have been happier if they'd made no end game movie and just left things open ended after infinity war. I felt the same disappointment after watching a DC movie, and marvel seemed to be the only hope left with super hero movies, and this sadly proved me wrong. They wasted so much time on going back in time with the infinity stooges and going into boring time lines and not enough time filling in blanks and expanding more on the characters we loved the same way they did in IW. It's sad this is how all these years of movies was wrapped up. What a disgrace. I actually left the theatre angry. I don't agree with how they left things with Thor, it doesn't line up with his character at all. It's like there were new writers and directors that had no idea who these characters even were and just tried to be funny."
86," Nothing happens for the first two hours
",Firstly I'm a big film buff. I watch on average one film per day crossing genres and countries. I watched the first two hours then turned this movie off and went to bed. Seriously two hours to cover what should only take about 40 to 50 mins. Normally films have twenty minutes to set the story and introduce the characters. This film spends one hour reintroducing characters from the other movies then the characters decide what to do. Then another hour of idle chit chat. This movie is full of itself. I'm so glad I didn't bother going to the cinema to watch this. I'm sure there was going to be some action at some point but I ran out of patience.

I though the latest title couldn't get much worse, until I watched Endgame.
Again, a movie that looks like a computer game, this time since the script failed to innovate, it goes back to the previous movies ""Back to the future"" style.
A fat Thor playing Fortnite, a Mjornir that any bloke can use, including the strange duck face Captain ""never gets his suit right"" Strangelip.
A captain that gets old and delivers his shield to the flying ""never had an impact role"" birdie. An intelligent nerdy Hulk who lost all his grace (a green Mark Ruffalo on steroids and that's it).
The list goes on and on, starting slooooow in the beginning to end in the yet again climax of the ""playmobil-bring the action man and all the transformers"" battle in the end, with depressing results and laughable deaths.
Bring the wife and put her on an iron man suit, hell bring the smurfs, the ""useless on this flick"" Black Panther and friends, Popeye and your dog if you want.
This is trash ""cinema"" in the making. let's skeese the money-cow with poor scripting, terrible CGI and ruin every child's fantasy regarding what is what and whom is whom on the ""Marvel"" universe.
Marvel, you were sold to Disney, get ready for your next princesses, easy jokes and death of your child heroes."
90," So bad - so cliched - should have known
","Seriously I am actually convinced now that nobody in the industry knows how to write an ending. they are so focused on leaving plot opening for a possible future opportunity that they cant give a satisfying ending!
Game of thrones and the decline of Stranger things to mention a few."
91," Awful. The worst avenger yet
","I know the reviews say differently. But it sucked.Could have been so much better.So impossibly random that a malfunction would happen to let Thanos see the pasts future which is impossible even for superhero movie standards.Plus if you had the all powerful hand you could have controlled the event and caused your not death. Just saying.And why was it so easy to chop hand and head in one scene but then, So difficult to handle Thanos with more super power hero's at the ready??Thor fat??? Just dumb, ruined the movie for me.Part one was just so good and flowed so well."
92," Major Disappointment
","I feel so strongly about how bad this movie was I had to open an account on IMDB just to vent so I can get some closure on the matter. Firstly it ruined date night with the wife, usually date night ends with fun times .. but not after this .. I mean how could we ? The mood was dead, just like the plot. I loved Infinity war, so I was really looking forward to this. Half hour in I got that sinking feeling, I tried to shake it and stay positive but to no avail. I got to the point where it was so painful I made a conscious decision to rather have a sleep that to endure the dreadful plot and weak representation of our much loved hero's. We were lied to at the end of Infinity War. When Fury drops his pager and calls for Captain Marvel, we did not know she was would be accompanied by Major Disappointment. Her character was pitched to save the day but she was incapable of doing that - half the movie we did not even know where she was. As for the other characters, Thor / Hulk / Star Lord, I have no words, I don't know these people. Sigh."
93," Very Disappointed
","The only good thing about the movie is that the time went by fast, but I will admit that I found myself looking around the theater often because some of the scenes were dragged outThere were inconsistencies with the first movie.Thor was a wussThis was the Iron Man show so he could go out like a hero who would sacrifice himself for the ones he loved.Thanos was just as powerful or more so without the Infinity Stones than with. At least it appeared that way to me. The only thing the infinity stones did was give him the ability to wipe out anyone and everyone with a snap of the fingers.Captain Marvel was useless.It almost made it seem like the guys were incompetent until the woman showed up. Then we had the Power Girls convention for a few moments in the middle of the battle with hundreds or thousands coming at them.Biggest waste of my money ever."
94," Worst one of the series
","With exception of handful actors play and CGI, this movie lacks in all aspects, thus making it outright pointless."
95," Top Rated Movies #9, are you kidding?
","You really think this movie is one of the greatest movies all-time? Better than Forrest Gump, Inception, and The Matrix? You must be joking!!"
96," What a waste
","Infinity War was amazing, but why is this a 8 worth? I felt like I totally wasted 3 hours of time for nothing. i'm glad I didn't went to the cinema for this. Not only was the movie WAY to long, the story was so clichè . Only 30 minutes of decent action and the rest absolutely nothing! Everyone knew already what was going to happen before this movie came out but it could have been executed much better.Endgame is a total waste of good character development,acting and story. What they did to the Hulk and to Thor was truly unacceptable. The Hulk became some nerdy green giant that doesn't do stupid things and Thor became a very bad drunk guy not to mention that Captain America had the power to hold Thor's hammer al of a sudden? Like what? Killing of heroes is 1 thing, but killing of ironman is totally not needed. Of all those 500 avengers on that battlefield why him? Ironman was 1 of the characters that made this movie a bit interesting.The ending was just weird....This wasn't what I expected after Infinity War. Such a shame."
97," Cash Grab
","This movie was disappointing! It didn't make sense to kill off Thanos in the first 10 min of the movie.The whole timeline opens up to many plot holes.You can tell Captain a marvel was an afterthought. They literally had he on the movie for 15 min runtime!This movie could have been saved if:1. No Time Travel
2. More Captain Marvel
3. Less Grieving scenes, (We get it)
4. More Actjon!!!"
98," wow what i garbage
","Soooooo bouring !!
called action movie ??? seriously !
it is actually a sleeping pills !"
99," I made account to comment it!
",The movie is not even worth half the rating it has got! It should be 3 or 4
100," A complete hype
","I have watched the movie when it was just released. A couple of months later and I was looking at the reviews. I cannot believe all the 10/10 scores for this movie.Personally I was extremely disappointed with this final movie. Infinity war was an amazing good movie, end game delivers a very simple story based on the time machine concept with plenty of flaws. While I understand the hype and the popularity of the MCU the movie was not bringing me what I was hoping for. There is no further clarification of what led to this movie. The new hulk is another example what I believe was too far fetched. But I don't think I should continue. Surely it is a must see, but for me remains Endgame one of the less convincing movie of this long series of movies brought to us in the las ten years."
101," Colossal waste of time
","Horrible movie. Boring and poorly written. I don't understand the high rating or the hype. I didn't even finish watching it because it was so awful. I love all of the Marvel movies, but this one was unwatchable. What a waste of a perfectly good Saturday night."
102," Story with CGI
",They wanted to make a film and tell a story with CGI. They failed. Why are actors giving their faces for this? Its the only human thing left in it. Everything else is just CGI. Tells me nothing.
103," Pathetic
","Boring. Slow. Badly written, poor story.... worst of a bad bunch"
104," What a disappointment!! Really poor.
","After infinity war which IMO is the best of all the avenger movies, I was really looking forward to the conclusion.Well, what a disappointment. The story made no sense at all. There was no character progression with Thor almost non existence! How can this be with him being the almighty god of thunder commanding the bi-frost in infinity war?!That pace or the movie was slow and boring, the acting lethargic with a real lack of fun.I found myself forwarding large chunks of this movie just to get to something good!The ending was a total shambles and pathetic! Total Hollywood cheese which really didn't work.They will no doubt make another Captain America movie so why end it like that? Passing the title of CA to someone else when they don't even have superpowers?!!The more I think about it the worse it is.Just a money making ending with no thought or direction.Should have left it with infinity war."
105," Unexciting, juvenile Marvel junk
","This was probably one of the worst movie I have seen, even on the Marvel scale. How can they take so many talented actors and make this non-sense? I laughed every time emotional drama came. Instead of tears, I was was feeling pity for myself. I hope this is really the endgame. But I doubt."
106," unsuccessful
","It is getting very boring now.
not realistic at all"
107," Too many inconsistencies
","I had to give this 1 star as it's not possible to give it less. Having avoided it at the Cinema because i knew it was a lost cause i finally watched it tonight......
Why does Thor have 2 functioning eyes? Having been told in Guardians of the galaxy that no one can hold an infinity stone and survive, suddenly everyone can now hold one? Where is the continuity in these films? Luckily this is the last we will ever see of this franchise! Until someone decides to do a remake as there are no original ideas anymore. J.J.Abrams you now have more films to ruin 👍🏻"
108," incoherent and full of contradiction
",Story is too weak to thrill anyone. the fighter and flying worms from thanos were supposed to die even at no strike. The culminating part (battle) of the movie was childish. 2/3 time was boring and ridiculous overacting scenes
109," More stars than it deserves
","Highlights of why it's terrible.Infinity stones control the flow of the universe and cannot be removed (sorceress supreme - endgame), I destroyed the stones (Thanos - endgame).Killing yourself while someone tries to stop you is not the other person making a sacrifice (soul stone would not be acquired)A sword cannot cut vibranium, jesus thors hammer doesn't scratch the ain't (Thanos America)Scarlet witch can easily kill Thanos so why doesn't she finish the job.The power of the gauntlet is the user can harness the power of the stones without being affected by them. (iron man and hulk would be unharmed, Thanos was only injured because he was trying to destroy them, he explains this at the start)An android linked to a cloud would know that she is and would switch off her WiFi.Someone who would contaminate 50 years of history because he misses his girlfriend is a personality trait that would prevent them being able to wield thors hammer.There are hundreds of inconsistencies compared to the established universe, if you are giving this film a ten star rating take off your rose tinted glasses."
110," Chaotic, in a bad way!
","Poor cgi for big budget movie! Nothing special in acting, regular things... Copy story from other movies like Inception and Star Trek.. Poor cinematography and soundtrack! General nothing special, nothing unique!"
111," Do yourself a favor, do NOT watch this movie.
","It's as though Marvel tried to destroy its own franchise in one movie. They make fun of their own creation. Fat Drunken Thor, really? That's America's? Smart Hulk? I didn't care whether any of the characters lived through this one. And if they die, so what? They went back in time to save half the universe already.And the present Avengers were incompetent in the past. Why? For a bit of comedy? The dwarves from Time Bandits were better at time heists than these morons.I wish I hadn't watched this one. It poisoned the rest of the franchise. I don't know if I'll waste my time re-watching older MCU movies knowing the way this ended it."
112," This was really bad
","This is a movie where one term could be used to describe it, and that term is ""tedium."" I've always had a begrudging attitude towards Avengers movies because, as with a lot of entries in the MCU, it's a lot of scientific nonsense with the action thrown in as an afterthought in order to justify its existence as a superhero movie. But I thought I would give Endgame a fair chance. After all, having all those superheroes on one screen should be fun, action packed, and entertaining, right? Wrong.I cannot express how terrible this film was. The two redeemable parts were Tony Stark's daughter and Ant-Man. They were the only entertaining parts of the film. I pay money to see movies that are entertaining, not ones that are so full of characters that you get lost.There are a lot of reasons that I hated this movie, but I'm going to focus on two in particular here: the story and the action, or rather, the lack of action. First, the story. This entire film was built around a needlessly complicated plot surrounding time travel, even though the time travel was completely pointless in the first place. Bruce Banner says, point blank, that traveling back into the past won't change the future. So, why do you do it, then? Why on Earth would you commit to such an exercise in complete futility? I'll tell you why, because you need more science fodder for all the Marvel super fans, so that they can leave the theater and point at someone who looks confused and feel superior.Everything was poorly written in this movie. When your forced obscenities are being spouted from the mouths of the people you're supposed to cheer for, while your villain speaks in Shakespearean soliloquies, then you've clearly gone completely wrong with your script. Also, the part where Stark's daughter swears and we were supposed to find it cute? Yeah, I didn't. I found it grossly inappropriate and wrong to show a 4 or 5 year old child in such a manner. It wasn't innocent and sweet, it was rather demented. Meanwhile, Thanos speaks in these long, grandiloquent speeches that never seem to have an end. It was all just one big pile of dreck.Thanos was another problem I had with this film. His motivations were never properly spelled out. They tried, but they failed rather miserably. It seemed like he just wanted to destroy the world because it was ripe for the taking, I guess? I don't know. He was weird as well, because he said he was going to build another universe, but he seemed to have a nihilistic outlook on everything, so that would mean his other universe would be completely pointless. Anyway, it was really terrible.But this movie's main sin was its lack of action through the first two-thirds, and the fact that it hardly showed the Avengers doing anything heroic. They never stopped a bank robbery, they never helped an assault victim, all they did was do their pointless time travel stuff to attempt to stop Thanos, even though Bruce said it would be completely futile to do so. The movie couldn't get out of its own way and it suffered because of it.Then the last third was all action and it blew my mind, but not in a good way. I left the theater with a physical headache due to the poor pacing and cinematography on the final battle sequences. They were overly long, started and stopped way too many times, and attempted to tie up every loose end from the entire MCU in one big bang. It was just terrible! You have to allow things to flow, and this movie didn't flow at all.A movie that was boring, poorly paced, poorly written, and just a terrible excuse for film definitely deserves a spot on my worst of 2019 list. Hopefully, Toy Story 4 makes up for it!"
113," Worst movie EVER

You SUCK. Even Masoud Dehnamaki could have done better than you two farmers.I would probably likeit if I were a sheep!!!
125," An ""Endgame"" without much of an ending.
","This latest of the Avengers series is pretty predictable because it is so formulaic: a convoluted set of story strings that must come together at the end, gratuitous little interpersonal dramas, and lots and lots of explosions, fistfights, and a pseudo battle of Armageddon. Also, predictably, the final battle must invoke Deus ex machina to save the day.It's too bad that a lot of engaging actors and Marvel characters are wasted on such an insipid, uninspiring script.The God wannbe, Thanos, is a boring and not a terribly scary sci-fi villain. He looks like a World Wrestling Federation refugee who overdosed on steroids. And, the quest for the five magic stones that give power over the entire universe sounds like a gimmick straight out of an adolescent-level video game.The first 60 minute takes forever to ramp-up. And the viewer is lost without remembering the previous installment,""Infinity War."" After a padded full three hours of superhero antics - so many superheroes I can't keep them straight - the ending is dismally anticlimactic. Killing off Iron Man seems terribly misplaced. And, just to drag out the boredom, it follows up with a painfully long shot of all the super heroes - clad in black - at a funeral that is, well, deadly.A forgettable fractured sci-fi yarn."
126," This is sooooo boring and empty in every ways
",Please don't waste your time on this...Its very boring. It's like they pre-sell the movie with a good ending of infinity war. Its a rip off. Trust me you won't believe this. I quite after 30 minutes.I am writing this review to alert people: keep your money and time for something else.

128," Every said its bad.
","It was ok, not great just ok. I like infinity war more."
129," Worse than a fanfic
","I have read better fanfic stories than this. It feels like the Russos tried to fix their plot holes by digging deeper. The humor was so cringy and nonsensical! If in a room full of 500 Marvel fans, only 5 persons laugh at the fat jokes, then you must ask yourself if it was really necessary. Because yeah, Thor, grieving and hopeless, became fat and... THAT WAS THE JOKE! Tony, almost a skeleton, inspires sympathies, but Thor, who is fat, is a joke. He's fat! That's the actual joke! WTF Russos??
The time travel doesn't make any sense. At all. No matter how many times it's repeated throughout the movie, it simply doesn't.
Can we also talk about Captain America whose character evolution went downhill?
Bruce Banner with the body of the Hulk is... I just don't have words anymore.
I give up. It was a terrible movie, filled with plot holes and regressive character dev. I lost 3 hours of my time I'll never get back and i'm sad that 10 years of being a hardcore MCU fan ended with THAT.
Side note: Scott Lang and Peter Parker are A++++ Not enough to save the movie though."
130," I Wish this Was the End
","Soulless junk. The first act promised a serious take on the nature of revenge but the movie quickly gave up on interesting thematic and became a senseless mess.I didn't care for a single character, the action was a confusing mess and the new characters do not give me much hope in the future of these Marvel films. On the plus side, this may mean diminishing returns on future instalments in this ""cinematic universe"" which would be great news for original films that aren't getting screened theatrically from the many megaplex screens being eaten up by this cynical capitalist trash. But hey... maybe the kids like it?"
131," Average

138," Good but over-rated
",A good movie for 12 years old kids! Super heroic movies don't belong in top 250 unless they're Nolan's dark Knight or philipses Joker. Marvel uses politics to win just like all other over-rated movies we're seeing these days. Cheers to the pure old cinema.
139," I wasn't strong enough to save her
","I didn't think this was politically correct enough. Captain Marvel is my favourite MCU character and It caused me great pain when the lovely Captain Marvel was brutally punched by the savage beast known as Thanos. I was overwhelmed with a great urge to help her like a heroic chivalrous knight but unfortunately as I sat there watching it on the screen in the cinema and knowing it wasn't exactly real, I knew I couldn't do anything about it and the second I realised that I burst into tears crying. If only I had the power to transport myself to fictional films I would've helped her out. I also thought the effects were terrible for a film with a $250 million plus budget and I felt Thor's alcoholism was inappropriate for a film that's watched by many children."
140," This movie took 181 minutes of my live the i'll never get back.
","It was a long time ago that i saw a movie this bad. It was a mix of Grease, Dirty Dancing and Star Wars combined. The endless tear-pulling scenes with heavy music and long faces. Storylines bouncing from left to right. At one point all wizards, superheros and comic heros came out of nowere to help fight the bad guy. It made no sense whatsoever. You have to be under 11 to appriacte this story. Sesame Street is a philosophical and deep story in comparison to this bad excuse for a movie."
141," Thanos now a bum

","A box office success, sure, not based on its merits though but rather that of its predecessors. Visually spectacular as we've come to expect from the Avengers franchise (and the only reason for the stars) otherwise unnecessarily long, bordering on boring and full of plot holes. A few endearing scenes and one major scene were the only semi-redeeming factors. Otherwise just SO SO disappointing **SOB**"
143," Terrible Dialogue/Script and Visuals Sucked - Why the high ratings!?
","This movie was horrendous - it seems like the script was written by a 10 year old. The humor was terrible and the story was fragmented. Really don't understand how people are rating this so high. Maybe another movie, Idiocracy, explains it all - people are just satisfied by dumber crap."
144," boring, bored, boredom - what a mess of a movie
","What a crying shame that a movie that had so many people awaiting its arrival delivered so little. And, it seemed to take forever to deliver that!I believe that this is one of the most critical reviews I have ever given and believe me, I firmly believe that it is wholly because my expectations were set so high by the franchise that it was pretty much doomed unless it was mind blowingly good.If the story had had one thread of; 'that was believable' or even an odd; 'that could work' it may have been able to recover but, it doesn't. It doesn't even have a; 'that was cool' at any point either!It's actually so boring I had finally found a movie I could replenish concessions during and didn't feel like I had missed anything. The reality is that I probably missed some really critical parts but it didn't matter, the movie had lost me long since then.The entire story was so convoluted that it was just plain terrible. The basic thread was non existent and I agree with many other reviewers that certain characters were pointless.Synopsis: Infinity wars was mediocre, this isn't. Also, personally, it has done so much harm to the franchise, I for one won't be bothering to spend the 'sizeable' costs involved in cinema excursions for any Avenger related future offering again."
145," So this is what they call a great film in 2019?
",I can't understand why ppl like this over-achting superhero garbage time after time... It is no cinema at all. Almost every storyline is the same. Marvel milking movies these days.
146," Per For Pre Pubescent Kids
","I'm going to make a leap here, just to leep things simple. The cumulative effect of so called ""super heroes"" is to the true film fan what the white man was to Native Americans: End of life as they knew it. There are 25 actors in this, and it's really sad to see them become prostitutes, like their studios. Why do you think great actors and directors wouldn't be caught dead in these cartoon films? Because they are the antithesis to great film making. Its really sad. I understand my 13 year old daughter seeing something like this. I don't understand older, more mature people acting like these are real films becauseT they arent. They are like the cartoons you woukd watch, before the main attraction started. They all have been dumbed down for the masses to the same exact plot: Good versus Evil; always. I wouldn't, no couldn't; sit through 15 minute of this pablum, not even if you paid me a year's salary to watch. It""s woeful trash, and is ruining the film industry. Stanley Kubrick the master of all the great directors, is rolling over in his grave. You won't see the top directors making any of this trash. People like Abel Ferrara, Marty Scorcese, Ridley Scott, William Friedkin, Spike Lee, or Denis Villeneuve go near a movie such as this. Its all publicity! All you hear about is how much money is made in the opening weeks, but nothing about what the films are like. It makes me sick. I would rather have my teeth drilled without novacaine than watch this. The same goes for the best actors. No way you will see ever see people like Bobby DeNiro, Christopher Walken, Matt Damon, Colin Farrell, Ethan Hawke, Nicole Kidman, or Al Pacino in any of these movies. I understand completely. It's simple. They have integrity! Skip this woeful hyped up trash and go see a real film; not a cartoon."
147," We need more 1* reviews to get the score down
","A country desperate to sell itself as a hero, together with current propaganda of misplaced feminism and diversity, Avengers is a shallow cliché that won't be enjoyed by anybody 25 years in the future. And yet here we are, selling confusion to adolescents, regardless their age. Tell me if that slap Gamora (female) gives to StarLord (male) would be nearly acceptable if it has been the other way around? Layers of unethical messages and contradictions that go straight to the midbrain. Unfortunate script for many good actors that participated in this super production designed for super degeneration."
148," I am disappointed. This is not Marvel any more.
","The first part of the movie is a sitcom, talking and dad's jokes. It almost(!) catches up with ""Friends"". If only movie was released in 1999...
The second part is even worse, It reassembles ""Back to the future"" but it definitely does not catch up even to 1989.
And there is this third part. Explosion of... left-wing ideology. You will instantly get a T-CD4 lymphocytes drop and vomit with rainbows. It ends with: SPOILER ALERT Capitan America being now black.
The CGI is great, I enjoyed it very much. But the best part of the movie was a trailer before. There is still hope in this modern world. ""Bad Boys"" are still black and still as brilliant as in 2009. I'm looking forward to watching them again."

My rating of 1 star is not right and I would give it a 3 or 4, but I feel it had to get 1 to try and level out this scandalous rating it has.Frankly the plot is unimaginative and poor and the logic used hapless. It just goes to show that they could produce any film, and as long as it has Iron Man and Co in it, then it will get a good rating."
151," We Waited All These Years For This!
","Okay so I've loved most of the Marvel films leading up to this final phase, great, i loved Infinity War.So watching this film for the first time was okay, because the old characters coming back and so on is cool once only, after watching the film again i was really bored, like really bored until the end fight.So for me this film was literally 2 hours and 30 mins of talking and stumbling around not doing much then followed by a Infinity War style fight scene which yes was cool but nothing special for the end of this phase.But the main point i want to get across is how much was wrong with this film, there is so many things wrong, I'm not gonna sit here and type 10,000 words to bore you with so all i say is go onto YouTube or Google and lookup ""Things wrong with End Game' and i guarantee you will change your mind about this film, you will reliase that not much makes sense and you will then be sad that this film was the end.Even my friends thought it was good at first, they gave it a 10/10 but after they picked the film apart they even saw how bad it really is.Age 25 - Cinema: Stevenage iMAX 3D Double Bill Infinity War + End Game

152," Illogical and Convoluted
","This is by far the worst MCU movie I've ever seen. Ever.I was looking forward to it after last year's Infinity War, to see how they would bounce back from that Thanos snap. But boy, was I disappointed. The whole ""time heist"" plot is tortuously senseless, it lacks any form of intelligence from any aspect, be it scientific or imaginative. What kind of ""writers"" are responsible for this? Or what were they on while ""writing"" this? The quick one-liners, barbs and quips are cringe-worthy and so are the ""comedic"" situations.One can objectively agree that the movie is way too long and boring for the first two hours, even my 11 yo super-fan brother thought so. It offers very little entertainment. The plot is too incoherent for any sensible adults and very complex to follow for the young ones so they just eagerly await the battle finale. Which does arrive at the end in the form of a badly choreographed CGI bukake scene with pyrotechnics and many, many cuts for anyone to follow what the heck is going on.Massive, glaring plot-holes abound from start to finish which I bet are invisible to the throngs of fanboys all over the world over-hyping and claiming this piece of hot, leaky garbage to be the greatest movie ever made. Along with giving it over the top reviews and ratings.Can't believe this is what sells to the masses and makes studios billions of dollars now. Makes me lose all hope in future superhero movies. I couldn't wait for it to get over and go home. A complete waste of time."
153," Missing big time on action
",Not sure about the rave reviews. But was a huge let down. It felt as if they just wanted to end the series . Infinity war could have been a better ending. Lot of flaws on time travel theory as well.
154," Long and sucky
","First off, phenomenal cast. I can't think of another movie that had even half the headlining talent that this one did. Still, it just plain sucked. Terrible dialogue, boring and repetitive special effects, and longer than Gone with the Wind.Also, I detest Gweneth Paltrow. I'd have given a 2nd star if they'd killed her, but they didn't so I didn't."
155," Avengers ridiculing themselves...
","...only to - after almost 2.5 hours of boring preparation - end up in a happy ending and of course more CGI laden version of ""Avengers: Infinity war"" with all the protagonists ever to have been in Marvel movies appearing on screen in a CGI festival which shows the true dilemma of modern movie making and the the Marvel world in special. They wanna pack it all in and in the end they get nothing, mixing it all up in a terrible way. We suddenly have Captain America to hold Mjölnir, Pepper Potts got a suit and fights (aargh!),Scarlet Witch seems to be the most dangerous opponent to Thanos, Thanos being apparently stronger without the stones (so don't go for them, dumb ass!) and among that all we have valkyrie riding her winged horse, just to mention a few. The only good scenes are the ones with Thor, and they are also the only ones where the emotional side is delivered in a believable way. Which is also a hint where the true magic of such movies _could_ be: telling stories of myths and magic, and not CGI overkill movies. Sadly, that's what we got once more, and the typical US approach anyway. So, this movie is nothing but 2.5 hours of time waste to end up in roughly 20 minutes of senseless CGI pseudo battle. If you watch it to be able to judge for yourself and get another idea of contemporary movie making, you can do that while making the dishes or doing something else useful in parallel."

","This is hopefully the end of this long standing, inconsistent, money spinning series. And it's also the worst of them all. First hour or so...one or two fight scenes. The rest is back slapping in jokes that you'd have to memorise all the other films to get, long drawn out pointless 'science' scenes or 'hilarious' takes on each characters' past dislike of each other (didn't two used to fancy each other? It's like that never happened), and oh yeh the characters all change...like all the time. Remember when this one was bad and this one was good? Not anymore! And what is with their hair?! At the initial meeting to discuss the film concept did someone just say ""hair. Too benign. Let's jazz that up a bit"" because it's as if one of the Avengers is Vidal Sassoon all of a sudden.This should be buried in a pit for future generations marked ""stop watching after Age of Ultron"""
160," okay, but definitely could have been better
","A lot of the movie was pretty good. the fight scene was awesome, especially when all the female characters got together. however the movie really romanticised tony, which didn't make any sense as it was made clear that he didn't care about anyone but himself, and was unwilling to help save HALF of the universe in case it interferes with his life. in my opinion, seeing someone like nebula defeat thanos would have been better (and fitted her arc of wanting revenge on thanos for ripping her apart). overall, this romanticisation of a character who has spent every mcu movie, especially this one, only caring for himself and refusing to accept consequences for his actions become the hero was disappointing and ruined the film for me."
161," Absolute waste of time
","What a waste of time. I am so sorry for all the Thor & Hulk fans. I really am. Movie makers played everyone for fools with all the hype. Lord of the Rings and Avatar remains my all time favorite.

It is highly likely that you will feel wasted like me, so at least you will have saved the money."

173," Too many holes in plot and too much emotional garbage
","Some parts were done well, revisiting the previous films was a treat but the film overall was pretty lousy. Cap and Tony's departure were not well executed. There are several reviews already on why Cap's exit was out of character and unlikely, look them up if you don't see it. Tony, always wrong, sacrifices himself finally after a lifetime of selfishness, which is a heroic exit in a way, but was a pretty lame ending for such an important character. The movie relies HEAVILY on trying to pull viewer's heartstrings vice have decent writing and make sense in many ways. The SJW nonsense has been out of control in these movies as well for sometime now, more prevalent in the agents of shield series though tbh. Time for Disney to let it go."
174," Where's the action in a superhero movie?
","Just couldn't not finish it. Felt like a Kardashian Endgame. glad i didn't pay, it any money. What has happened to marvel movies in general are those positive reviews bots or bought? There were less than 1/3 action. The rest were full drama, for a almost 3 hour movie doesn't seem realistic."
175," 2 and a half hours of fluff, 30 minutes of decent action
","I did not care for a single second of what was really happening. Too much emphasis on certain characters while others are left in just to make it seem more ""epic"". Hulk was the only character of any entertainment value. I was more entertained by the audiences reaction to certain scenes than the actual film. The scene where Black Widow dies, the girl behind me whispered to her friend: ""Is she dead?"" Like no s*** you just saw her fall of a cliff and slam on the ground.Besides the 30 minute battle, how they handled Tony Stark's death was well done, especially the funeral. If they ended on that long shot showing all the characters, then I would of liked it a little more, but it just kept going.It bored me to death. I only saw it because on how it was considered a ""cinematic event"" to most. To the lovers of film, I really don't recommend it. Just wait for the final battle to be put up on YouTube or something and watch that."
176," time travel? ideal for plot holes!
","Time travel destroys any film...time travel doesnt exist in the physical world..its an invention of writers and authors to close plot holes and impress audiances...so, any film or book containing time travel, IS A MESS! so, i dont see any reason to grade this movie more than 2 stars...cgi, fights, ok , but a real good movie, must have a believable story! for me, sorry it didnt work...
question...why thor and hulk had to be humiliated so much in this movie ? why toni stark had to die? to offer the framatic essence to the story?is this the end of marvel heroes?"
177," Traumatic Disappointment
","Tone, pacing, character arcs, plot holes, emotional connect, logical depth,story, propagandas, Plot convenience, lazy writing.Overrated, overhyped cashgrab.
(Plot holes can be justified but the emotions, how one feels about it cannot) Endgame forces us to constantly think outside the box about the writing part. Infinity war is an amazing film but how did they manage to get the first one so right and the second so wrong. It looks like they were just trying to copy DC for having a dark ending but even they give a symbol of hope when Superman dies.Shame, a decade of characters development wasted.
..1. Tony has finally moved on and retired having a family, overcoming his panic attacks and anxiety realizing that he doesn't have to save the world anymore, but there you go the writers decided killing the basic true sense of his arc, putting him at the spot to sacrifice himself again like he was going to in all previous films and giving a dark terrible ending hurting every kid who grew up watching him for a decade, they could have sent him to coma like in the comics at least. Then a deliberate attempt by the writers trying to convince all that it was okay to kill him with the Tony's speech. It felt like they had to do this for the sake of continuing with phase 4 in Mcu to make more money so he had to forcefully die because this is supposed to be ending for all.* also this film is lost in itself lacking emotional depth as it is satisfactory to know that he is alive in many other alternate timelines. Whoever accepts this ending has failed to understand this character because all believe he's selfish man turning into a legend. Yes, this time he had much to loose -a daughter but still he was always selfless when it came to saving world like every other superhero in world at any given moment and he always played the sacrifice game welcoming death because he is that legend indeed.
2. Thor was already ruined enough in Ragnarok but they managed to make him a fat joke. Thor rejects the throne in Dark World so he could learn more and protect Earth. But he accepts the throne in Ragnarok because he feels ready and he needs to, also now he's in his most powerful form to rule. But in this film he rejects the throne once again and gives it to Valkyrie. We have a Hulk who doesn't get enough importance not even a minute of solo fight after he got beaten by Thanos in IW. Then comes Captain Marvel who is said to be the most powerful but doesn't get a proper combat against Thanos and gets defeated within seconds.
3. People expected that Steve Rogers will die so they made him live, here he leaves his best friend Bucky without giving him a purpose after all the journey they've been through and letting him to still be a sidekick where he doesn't get to either retire nor be the next captain as he hands over the shield to Sam. Steve decides to go away to live in the past out of nowhere and does not accept his reality though peggy asked him to move on...he could have done that starting fresh in the present and also be a responsibile support system for future Avengers, retirement done wrong.
4. Thanos who is this guy? he's not our villian who we travelled with in IW. This is just a guy who is saying that he is going to enjoy killing people. The writers here are trying their best to make him look bad with new different ideology because the audience somewhat liked him in IW. He is there for the necessity of a big bad guy in the climax.
5. The final war had one of the greatest moment in cinematic history which is the entrance of all heroes that was fun to watch because it is the basic reason- final biggest superhero team up movie which audience waited to see.
After the entrances this turned out to be the worst battle ever where it's all just action without any logic , unwanted humor and forced team up shots. This action flick concludes the ten years of storytelling with a War sequence..whole big battle episode is a disgrace to war scenes of great films where everyone in a war is supposed to be useful.-Being the so called biggest action 3-hour long comicbook event film, we come to a stage just after like 8 mins where everyone is useless without screen time and in the final setup the only one left to face against thanos is again the same Tony Stark who was willing to sacrifice himself for Nth time.-I wish to see the 14 billion ways of Doctor strange which writers failed to work on to make a better film but they chose this because whatever they make because of the hype it was destined to hit big to carry-on the franchise without stopping.A celebration turned into a tragedy."
178," Mind numbing. I just had to turn it off.
","I can never be bothered with reviews but this films rating is beyond a joke.
Plot is awkward and ridiculous... even for Marvel.
Acting is non existent. Direction and editing just feels amateurish.
I couldnt deal with anymore after the 1st hour it was excruciating.
It feels like they gave a class of children the old ""how would you end the avengers"" lesson and just put all the answers in a bag and picked one.... and then just made it work.... or so they thought.
I may feels the urge to watch the 1st half again and hope it inspires me to watch the conclusion but its highly doubtful."
179," Snooze....
","My kids were very excited to see this but I was more apprehensive. Really, the film is far too long, just unnecessarily. Parts of this film were very boring and were an ideal time for a cinema snooze! It had so much more potential but directors lost site of their aim. Disappointed."
180," Incredibly dull finale of an amazing franchise
","The great thing about the Avengers-Franchise has always been this winning scheme:1. A range of very different characters like Thor, Spidey and Strange, clashing together in witty and funny dialogues that showcases just how different they are. Spidey cracking jokes about deep philosophic insights of Strange, while Thor asks about beer.2. Incredible fight scenes3. Both may be linked by a variety of different narrative elements, from film-noir/detective over comedy to splatter.It's an easy base recipe, that may be filled with any narrative strings, so long as they are intriguing.Problem with the Avengers movies and the finale in particular is:The winning scheme is NOT used and the narrative underlying is poor, at best.They picked parts of a variety of comics (like the ""Thor get's irresponsible and fat""-plot), which is ok and linked them very poorly together. It's a series of short plots, loosely tied together with no red line (other than ""Thanos is the Endboss"").Secondly, the acting is poor, apart from Iron Man of course! Even Chris Hemsworth and Scarlett Johanssen do a really bad job at depicting their character. The digitally animated raccoon is a highlight in terms of acting.There is only ONE AVENGER-TYPICAL FIGHTSCENE, which is great, but does not make up for the rest.Foot-Note: As a Non-American, the Glory-Halleluja-Murica focus on Cap is too much. If you're patriotic enough, you'll love it, of course."
181," A horribly, boring and goofy installment. Worst one yet.
","This was a terrible film. I rented it and feel like I wasted my money. The movie is 3 hours long. 2 of those hours is just nonsense, comedy, and jabber. Then you get about thirty minutes of the big fight, followed by another thirty minutes of boredom. The male heroes are portrayed as buffoons, which is indicative of today's masculine-man-hating society. Based on today's man-hating culture, testosterone is evil. Women should be lumberjacks and Seal Team Six. Men should take estrogen pills and ask their wives to open the stuck peanut butter lid. I'm a proud sexist. I open doors for ladies. I also send my lady flowers just because versus craftsman tools.This was one of the worst Avengers installments ever. Writers are so busy pushing their masculine-man-hating agenda by making the two most powerful Avengers (Thor and Hulk) water downed buffoons. They failed to capture the essence of the Avengers. If the Hulk and Thor are not smashing something or someone that is extremely powerful, Marvel isn't worth watching IMHO. They are the ultimate warriors. Yet in this installment, they are childish buffoons. The nadless, testosterone-hating writers of today have devolved the franchise into an Everybody Loves Raymond-esque sitcom. However, Everybody Loves Raymond is better written."

","Watched last evening on Blu-Ray and was quite disappointed. Should have streamed it for a lot less. What in the world is going on with the writers and producers these days. Plot was weak at best. Time Paradox was poorly done. Character development bordered on the ridiculous. Thor was made into a bumbling drunk idiot, Hulk was....I don't know, some kind of a cross between Banner/Hulk working in a diner, and was nearly useless like in Infinity Wars, Captain American now has and can wields Thors' hammer. What in the world is going on! This unfortunate change started surface with Infinity Wars. They also made sure all the politically correct stuff was jammed right in there. The first two remain the best, don't even bother with the others. Sad!!"
185," Love Marvel, hate Endgame
","Love adventure, superheroes and Marvel, but this movie was awful and completely booring. This should have been made into a 15 minute ending of the previous movie. Don't understand who this appeals to. We were a mixed gender group and all of us just waited for it to finally end. Don't except anything exciting or interesting. The plot is easy to see through and they fail miserably to create any emotional connection with the audience."
186," Telling my 14 year old self...
","Well if I went back in time and told my 14 year old self about this film as she watched the first Iron Man...well she would have been disappointed. This was a horrible, boring film. Waited this long for the film equivalent of a root canal, painful, boring, and way overpriced. Don't feel ashamed if you didn't like this ""film"""
187," One of the most overrated films of all time
","Acting extremely sub-par, terrible story, and a cheap piece of non directional fan service."
188," Cheap sentimentalism and plot all over the place
","This was supposed to be the final movie that crowed the franchise and Infinity War set high expectations. I was utterly disappointed. The plot doesn't make sense and throws away a lot of character development, to the point that some of them are just shallow version of what they were in other movies (and could become).But what really annoyed me was the sentimentalism that permeated the whole movie. It is like you have to shed a tear for every character and the movie is trying to make you cry in scenes that don't move the plot forward. If in Infinity War they really stroke a good balance between action and emotion, here they just are there for the sake of it."
189," Cannot see what the fuss is about
","It's long winded...easily could be half the 3 hours.... Superhero movies are about battles and heroes...not crying and moaning. Watching iron Man wimper off was such a let down. After watching every avenger movie, I am so disappointed. Only 1 good battle, and it's over too quickly. So so so disappointed...I'd take any other avenger movie over this one."
190," Bomb
",Glad I only wasted $4 watching this awful movie. 3 hrs I never get back . I really liked Guardian of the galaxy and infinity war . But this is just trash .
191," You thought Cpt Marvel was bad?
","Watch this movie, it can be far worse! I understand that Infinity War set a high bar but this one is a joke; time travel, better known as ""deus ex machina"" for lazy writing, is primary thing here that was never explained.And trust me, that is the least of the problems!Yes, the effects were nice so hence 2/10 but effects were never so important in Avengers; others at least had some sort of story and action, this one is dull."
192," Couldn't get behind it
","It was somewhat entertaining. But the story was just beyond unbelievable. All the crying and moping and ""we're grieving so hard over here"" was dumb.Cap longingly staring at his girlfriend's picture all of a sudden felt forced. Like they decided last minute how his story would end so now, after I don't know how many movies of him not exhibiting that specific behavior, he's all love sick all of a sudden.Hated the scene where the lady super heroes get together to get the glove to the time machine. I get it, girl power! Yay! But it felt so damn forced I rolled me eyes so hard I saw the back of my skull.What made me dislike the movie most was that despite their best attempts at tying loose ends, it felt like lazy writing. Probably because when they wrote the first three movies they didn't have the foresight to drop (or use) Easter eggs that would be found in Endgame. An example is Cap's sudden longing for his girl.I honestly couldn't wait for the movie to be over. Glad I red boxed it."
193," Watching peices of wood act
","I personally have not been a fan of the avengers since the russo brothers took over. The acting in this film was like watching a middle school play. No emotion from anyone except jeremy renner and rdj. Way too long and the plot was just stupid, i think this goes to show huge budget definitely doesn't make a amazing movie."
194," Extra star for CGI.
","I thought the Infinity Wars was bad, but this has brought Marvel/Disney to a new low. The idea of going back in time and changing the present is as old as the hills, but it also opens Pandora's Box. It means you can do it again and again. Which negates the foundation of reality. This plot, unlike the last Avenger's movie, relies on pseudo-science instead of the supernatural. I love science fiction, but this was anything but. Spoiler: Stark looking at a Mobius Strip and somehow realizing time travel was possible was painful to watch. So then they go back in time, make everything hunky dory, as it was before Thanos, but Ironman get killed in the process. So not only did Marvel kill off it's number one action hero (at the box office), but it showed the world that nothing bad can ever happen, because we can simply go back in time and make it better. Interesting how all the characters scoffed at the idea as well, before they actually did it. Time travel movies are fun, but only if they can never be repeated. Using it as a plot device to restore everything to as it was before, was just a cheap trick. I would have been more impressed if Dr. strange found a new set of stones and changed everything back. As a Marvel fan from the Silver Age of Marvel (1960s &70s) I wish Disney would have stuck to the comic magazines closer and not tried to bring the Marvel universe to a depressing conclusion."
195," Dreadful
","The first part of this film is painful to watch, as there's very little dialogue. The plot isn't much good either. I don't see why people loved it so much. And it's way too long."
196," Why is this so popular?????
","Where can I even start with this thing? Why do people act like it's one of the greatest, most visionary works in years? It took me three days to get through the whole slog and the more I thought about it afterwards, the worse it got. If it didn't become the highest grossing movie ever I probably wouldn't have bothered finishing it. The fact that it got that much money is truly head-scratching; it was even bad by normal Marvel standards, let alone Scorsese ones. (Infinity War was at least more entertaining.)To all the people calling this a great culmination to so many movies: How could you treat this like any kind of ending? We all know that Disney's going to churn out as many more of these movies as they can, and probably drag RDJ back into it once people finally get sick of them. I've already heard people are clamoring for 'the next Endgame', which shows how much staying power this one has. It'll probably go the same way as Martin and Lewis movies: an extremely popular fad that will eventually become an embarrassment; a punchline.To all the people saying 'something like this has never been done in cinema before': Not exactly. Have you seen Abbot and Costello Meet Frankenstein? You get a crossover between Frankenstein, Dracula, the Wolf Man, the Invisible Man, plus Abbot and Costello. Yes, it's not on the same level as Endgame, but it is still something *like* it. To say nothing of the first Avengers movie which was still better than this.And by the way, Martin Scorsese was right. This movie-and all other M 'C' U films made in the past 5-10 years-are not cinema because they have become an extended TV show. This doesn't play at all like a cinematic climax at all, it plays like the last episode of a TV series: a mediocre creation spending an inordinate amount of time referencing the previous episodes. So Avengers Endgame is not cinema the same way the Seinfeld finale is not considered cinema.The visuals: -1 star. They are the usual murky CGI and greenscreens, nothing special at all. They thought they could get an Oscar for this? The final battle is an ugly CGI mess that makes the Ready Player One final battle look like a masterclass. There's no beauty or scale or anything in the battle to visually show that this is supposed to be an epic final struggle; instead it plays out like any other Marvel action scene just with tons more characters thrown in, puking worthless energy beams and buzzing around like flies on a corpse.The soundtrack: +0 stars. It's competent, but quite bland and forgettable. Let's just say that no one will be rushing in line to buy the soundtrack.The plot: -4 stars. Tons of McGuffins, and they must all be collected with time travel. The time travel storyline caused innumerable inconsistencies. Try as the Endgame fans might, there is no way to make sense of this garble. Go back in time to get more Pym particles? Go back in time and kill Thanos in the Infinity War final battle? No, they have to do it *exactly* this way. I seem to remember they refused to save Black Widow after she died because 'the guy said she was dead for sure'. Then Gamora came back even though she died the same way in the previous movie. I don't really have a problem with plot holes generally, but the script just kept calling attention to them in a meta, snarky way. Meanwhile, the entire 'snap' resolve was cheap and lazy; exactly what I expected would happen after finishing Infinity War. So, after 4 years suddenly as all these long dead people just *return*. There is NO way you can explain this in a way to make it sound sane. Meanwhile, Tony Stark's sacrifice scene is rotten. Basically what happens is he grabs all of Thanos' power stones and uses them to do the same thing to Thanos that Thanos was trying to do to them: turn him into dust. So, this Machiavellian mess is the culminating message of the 20-something movie series? The guy with the most power wins using whatever means are available? That's literally everything; it's the only message. The reason the Lord of the Rings had such a great story was that the characters had a massive power, but couldn't use it, and that caused a deep psychological tension. Here there's nothing; just grab the most powerful stuff there is and use it to kill your opponents and 'win'. It sucked. The most real kind of courage is when people know they're going to lose and keep fighting anyway. It would have been nice to have that here instead.The script: -3 stars. We don't expect great scripts from these movies, but at least they're usually funny. This is probably the least funny Marvel movie ever, with barely a single joke landing. (Fat Thor could have been funny but they sucked the humor out of him by having him sulk almost all the time). All of War Machine's 'funny' lines are truly cringey, as are the couple of belated, out of place jokes from the many actors who cameo at the end. So, it isn't funny. The screenplay then drains the rest of its energy trying to cover up plot holes it knows the audience will anticipate, but doesn't even succeed and all that dialogue just highlights the inconsistencies. Case in point: the infamous 'baby Thanos' dialogue. Case in point: the entire stupid 'time travel doesn't work that way' saga. Calling other time travel movies garbage is not a way to give your one a free pass. If they would have just owned up to the plot holes instead of attempting to explain them away with meta, lazy dialogue, it would have been more bearable. And don't even get started on the emotional dialogue, but at least they tried to be somewhat serious for once.The acting: -1 star. I never realized how bad an actor Chris Evans was until he tried to be emotional in this movie. RDJ, once so charismatic and funny, is reduced to the stale shtick of pop-culture references and product placement. Lots of the others looked bored as they spent a huge majority of the movie sulking, moping, getting drunk, having therapy, whining, killing for spite, etc. And then all they can obsess about is reversing their loss so they win; it's even worse than the Democrats after the 2016 election. Are they really that sore of losers? It's been FIVE freaking years! Get over it. It's surprising they didn't just kill themselves in their mire of self-pity.The positive: Well, I can't find any. This is the first one star review I've given on this site."
197," Please stop making them
","If one Avengers production budget funded indie movies, we'd have hundreds of thousands of engaging, good indie films. Please stop making these films now. Just stop.

","After Infinity War I was expecting Endgame to be the best movie made for all time, but it seemed like Infinity War was so great that the producers ran out of good material for Endgame. So instead of another decently awesome Marvel movie they went polar opposite to Infinity War and decided to make the worst movie possible. They chose to destroy the foundation of each of the main Avenger characters and prop up the secondary characters as the heroes in order to share the screen or be politically correct or something silly like that. And can we please stop making movies about time travel. It's stupid and impossible to do correctly and impossible in general so just ditch the idea! There's a lot more I could say but it's been almost a year now and I just don't care enough to keep tearing this movie apart. Basically I'm done watch Marvel because of this movie."
200," It is the worst movie i have ever seen.
",Mumbo jumbo happy ending jumping around horse crap. I could vomit from it. Even the music is crap. The only thing good in this movie is Thannos' voice. Also there was 2 good jokes. Well done. How much was this? ooo yeah.. a lot. I pity the people who loves this. It was horrible.
201," Most overrated film of all time
","This wasn't just bad as in disappointing, it was one of the worst films I've ever endured. I was enjoying it until 'time travel', and from then on it spiralled downwards until it hit rock bottom. Just terrible.
You know how Iron Man 3 was unwatchable? Well imagine that, but a hundred times worse and even longer.
It amazes me how someone, at some point, gave this the green light to be made and then wasted $350million on this disaster.
It's difficult to know where to start with this insufferable abomination, but I guess it must just be me as it made a ton of money at the box office and seems to get decent reviews.
If this is an indication of the standard of where the Avengers movies were heading, then good riddance. The proof in what I'm saying is the appallingly bad 'Spider-Man Far From Home', which is also one of the worst films I've ever had the misfortune to see.
I give it one star for the last 20 minutes where the series was wrapped up.
Disney, please don't inflict any more of this garbage on the world."
202," Like Eastenders with capes.
","Painful, crass, belligerent. I went to see it on a whim and walked out of the cinema after 15 minutes."
203," Too Long
","What a waste of 3 hours. Too long, boring and ridiculous."
204," Brainless people wrote this.....
",Ridiculous....if you die in past how the heck are you alive in future... Blind and idiot fans says this is a masterpiece....
205," 10 year old me would have liked it
","A CGI mess...Ao many plot holes,terrible jokes and overall stupid movie made for its 12 year old audience"
206," Extremely stupid movie
",Don't waste 3 hours of your life. There are only special effects are interesting.
207," It's just Fan service
","The movie was made for only two things, the first eliminate all the old actors with a supposedly amazing end, that is just Fan service. And the other fact is that Marvel just wanted to make money however they could do something more impression.I have to admit that the special effects were fantastic and the movie was really funny to watch."
208," The best animated film of the year
","This film is all about CGI effects and animation.
0% mind blowing.
80% nonsense science
20% jokes"
209," I was excited about this and it was going great until Captain Marvel swooped in to ruin this move also
","Captain marvel movie was a complete feminist propaganda movie, where Ms Marven had no weaknesses and only more power and more power and insane power with no story line weaknesses, which made the film boring.Maybe I was over hyped for avengers, I heard rumors that Captain marvel may be in it, but I had waited long enough.
The movie was just not memorable at all, but it completed a story, the final nail on the coffin was when all the avengers tried their best against the mighty Thanos only to have sarcastic captain marvel swoop in at the end and boast about how she saved other planets ( even though Thanos killed 50% of everything ) and felt earth was on the last on her todo list.
She right their could of snapped Thanos neck like a twig but wanted to make the other avengers feel special as she jetted up and threw her self into battle cruisers like a asteroid. Basically if the avengers would of stayed at home and had Shwama eventally Captain Marvel would of sorted it all out with her infinite power.
I felt the rest of the cast were like police officers in a Hero hostage situation, she fly's down pats them on the back and says "" Hey your doing a good job "" only to fly up and handle everything."
210," Full of disappointment
","In my opinion, they should have never filmed Endgame, it would be much better to finish everything with Infinity War, it would be much better because Infinity War was THE BEST EVER. and Endgame was very, very weak movie compared to it or any other marcel movie. I would prefer to not have seen Endgame."
211," Too Predictable
",There was nothing unexpected in this one. Of course the characters that were dead somehow came back to life. We all knew that had to happen before we watched it.Obviously this kind of movie is made for children and for adults with the minds of children. But I can't imagine any normal adult enjoying it.
212," Badgame
","Worst of the Worst !!!
After IW(which is amazing) this was a disaster. BAd bad movie !!!!"
213," Awful sentimental snooze-fest, totally overrated.
",One of the dullest films I've seen in a long time. The initial three quarters of the film is taken up with sentimental and tedious character development twaddle including flashbacks. It ends with 30mins of seen it all before low rent CGI action. That this can have a rating of over 8 is a testament to the serious dumbing down of our popular culture.
214," Just terrible!
",They've really scrapped the bottom with this one! Oh so Bad!
215," This is a pain, a terrible pain
","This movie goes far far beyond the last season of Game of Thrones to become the worst expected thing of 2019. What a pain to me, what a waste of my time. Everything is just not what it should have been.
Believe or not, the comedian Thor is the best thing in this movie.
After putting second thought about the movie to write this review, I decided to rate it 1 instead of 2."
216," Extremely bad!
","This is so not ok! It is extremely bad! On so many different levels, this is awful!"
217," Just like the rest of them.
",Weak writing.Bad guys are bad for the sake of being bad.Too much reliance upon CGI and cute punchlines.
218," Absolutely Terrible
","This film is so garbage I can't even comprehend it, none of the ""emotional""scenes don't even make a tear shed at all, Tony Stark's death was terribly written and acted out, Robert Downey Jr.'s performance is horrid. The action scenes are slow and drawn out, and the ending scene is completely disappointing. This is a very inadequate superhero film compared to others such as The Incredible Hulk (2003) and Steel (1997). To sum it up a terrible example of Marvel's avengers."
219," This is all we get as the capstone of Marvel's phase whatever?
","Terribly disappointed in the effort. There should have been something ""more"". The movie plods from scene to scene with no real tension, almost as if marvel is giving the viewer the cliff notes on the last 10 years of films. Even the end battle was snooze-worthy, including the mostly useless Captain Marvel showing up as the deus ex machina."
220," Is this movie from the same guys who made The Last Jedi??
","Overwhelmingly boring!!! Thanos the farmer, really? This is a soap opera!! Don't waste your time and money watching this BAD JOKE!!"
221," Good standalone movie, but not so great as a sequel to Infinity War - click on down arrow for more info
","I'm a huge fan of the MCU, and honestly, I think I've watched Infinity War over 20 times prior to watching Endgame. I had high expectations for the sequel, and actually thought it would be deeper than it turned out to be. Endgame is intricate, yes. But intricately shallow. Here are some things I thought would happen but didn't. First of all, I counted on every line in Infinity War, thinking it would imply something greater in Endgame.Example 1:
When Thanos asked Red Skull ""Where is the Soul Stone?"", Red Skull responded, ""You should know, it extracts a terrible price."" Thanos replied with ""I am prepared,"" and Red Skull said, ""We all think that at first. We are all wrong.""This led me to think that perhaps in Endgame, Thanos regrets his decision to kill Gamora, and somehow the stone would turn on him or doesn't work the way it should because what he did to her was not really love. He selfishly sacrificed her, and true love is putting someone else's needs before your own. Although this part is sort of redeemed in Endgame when Nat sacrificed herself for Clint (to contrast what Thanos did to Gamora), Endgame still should have shown how Thanos was ""wrong"" in thinking that he could let Gamora go if he did truly love her. Doing so would have also added another facet his character. However, in Endgame, Thanos was not the same as he was in Infinity War. He had no conviction and became even more ruthless in his avenging.Example 2:
Dr. Strange told Tony Stark ""We're in the endgame now"" and ""there was no other way"" right before he turned to dust.I had high hopes for Dr. Strange and his creative problem-solving skills in Endgame. I thought he had perhaps sent the time stone to the past or future to do some ""work"" prior to handing it over to Thanos. But nope, there was nothing. He handed over the actual stone. There was no manipulation of it. There was also no game plan. Dr. Strange HAD NO PLAN! He basically saw his 14+ million possible outcomes that they would win by some stroke of luck, and bet everything on that one chance (which was a mouse hitting some switches in Ant-Man's time machine van). Wouldn't it have been more intricate if he had sent the stone to the past or future to tamper with time, or to somehow orchestrate events in a way where their winning was more premeditated and planned, than merely by some stroke of luck or some random chance?Example 3
In Infinity War, when Vision offered to die to save half the universe, Captain American told him, ""We don't trade lives Vision"", and Vision said, ""Captain, 70 years ago you laid down your life to save how many millions of people, tell me why is this any different.""I thought Captain America would be the one who would sacrifice himself in Endgame, perhaps the one to undo the snap. He was the one who previously laid down his life for millions and perhaps he should have done it in Endgame.
I'm bummed about a few other things. I couldn't relate to the characters as much as I did in Infinity War. Endgame's characters' interactions felt more scripted and robotic.I wasn't convinced that Morgan was Pepper's daughter. I didn't sense that connection between them. There was no scene of Pepper tending to Morgan in the movie, except for the end when she held Morgan at Tony's funeral. I didn't feel sad at Tony's funeral. Nobody cried there. Yes, he was a true hero, but there should have been some tears. Maybe they all saw that his death was unpreventable, but still, the loss didn't seem emotionally impactful (to me).I really did not like what they did to Thor in Endgame. They stripped him of his dignity. I thought maybe they would redeem him by the movie's end, but they didn't. He was still fat and no longer desired to lead Asgard. Back on the alcoholism road, maybe? Thor also had both Mjolnir and Stormbreaker in Endgame, yet he couldn't even strike Thanos (who had no stones to empower him this time).The melding of Banner and Hulk was underwhelming. It was Hulk's extremity that made him The Hulk. Banner-Hulk may seem like ""the best of both worlds,"" but it made the character too palatable, too compromised, and not exciting or powerful. He wasn't a strong fighter like the Hulk, and he just looked like a green Thanos with glasses. There should have been a Hulk and Thanos rematch to redeem the Hulk at least!Also, how did Captain Marvel come in just the right time at the beginning and the end to help save the day? That end-credit scene in Captain Marvel where she comes back asking ""Where's Fury?"" should have been included in this movie. I also think she should have been included MORE in this movie if she is to be considered an Avenger and a part of the team.And the ending...how did Captain America age after living a ""normal"" life with Peggy? And even if they did marry, wouldn't he still have looked only 40 years old after she had grown old and died? And what if they had kids? Wouldn't their kids run into Peggy's original kids with her previous husband? Confusing and just odd.There were a LOT of superheroes in this movie (especially when the snap was reversed), but they all felt like strangers to me. I could not connect with them, perhaps because there was only so much that could be jam packed in 3 hours.All in all, I thought the movie was good because it was still complex. I loved the action scenes and I enjoyed seeing some characters rekindling with loved ones from their past. However, this movie did fall short in quite a few areas and just wasn't as deep as I had hoped it would be. The time traveling had its own plot holes, and I truly miss Vision and the 2018 Gamora.I think Infinity War was the better movie. Endgame, by itself, was a good standalone movie, but it wasn't well executed as Infinity War's sequel. Even though Infinity War and Endgame had the same sets of writers and directors, it didn't feel that way. The pacing, plot progression, and division of screen time for actors were handled more aptly in Infinity War, in my opinion."
222," Such a sad, pathetic end for one of the greatest movie franchises ever.
",It was really bad. Incredibly slow. The plot was full of holes and they pretty much destroyed some of the best characters ever.Just a really bad movie.
223," The old comics are covered with dust and oblivion.
","Thanos original purpose was to give his bride The Dead itself, the half of universe´s lives, as wedding gift. The evolving thing was too sense as a goal for a mad cosmic being as Thanos, anyway none care about it. The old comics are covered with dust and oblivion.I couldn´t stand the Captain America having the power of lightning and masterfully using Mjolnir, like he was expend training all his life with it. Totally sickining. ""He is worthy"" well he just need it to throw it, and wield it, just like that.Hawkeye the forgoten advenger was in a crazy rol, who cares? Where were Adam Warlock and Magus and even more The Living Tribunal?Why name this movies ""Infinity war""? with the excuse of the alternate filmic universe, very powerful plots are crumbling, one after another.Maybe that happens when you expect that new things overcome the old ones, or even that match just a little."
224," The most overrated movie of the decade
","Everything that could go wrong went wrong. We've had countless time travel movies before, but this one had the worst mechanics by far...and by mechanics I mean there were no mechanics whatsoever. Time travel could no whatever you wanted to as long as it helped the plot advance even if it did not make any sense and came without any consequences. 1 hour into the movie there were already so many loopholes and inconsistencies that I stopped counting. Thanos turned from a lion into a kitten (to avoid saying another word) and your typical evil character. It was so bad that it actually got me laughing when Tony Stark was dying...now that's an achievement on its own. So much time was spent around our protagonists and yet they never felt as thin as they did now. Infinity War was a much much more satisfying movie. Never thought I'd say this, but I'd rather watch Batman Vs Superman over this crap. Now all that I hope for is that it does not break Avatar's box office record or else that would be the joke of the century.
Don't get me wrong though, I still highly recommend watching it....for all those below the age of 12...because that's how immature you must be to ignore all of the movie's flaws."
225," I thought the mcu would change
","I thought the mcu was going to change after infinity war but this garbage proved me wrong. I thought they would stop doing the same generic garbage crap after infinity war but nope. Tbh it still hurts that's they reversed infinity war, infinity war would still be a 10/10 if they didn't reverse it and I'd be a marvel fan boy but nope, they just had to turn to this garbage again."
226," Forgettable
","I watched this movie for a second time and didn't realize before half way through that I already had seen it.
I grew up reading comics and I enjoy good movies based on such - but this is not a good movie.
Iron man, Guardians and Ant man - all have great movies and the start of Avengers also brought something exciting.
Endgame is boring, lacks imagination and feels like a neverending wait for it to end. The main problem is that they try to make it epic and over the top righteous - and succeed cutting all emotional ties to the audience.
See it so you can talk of it, but prepare to fast forward, fall asleep or a me - forget that you have seen it."
227," hi
","What's missing from ""Endgame"" is the free play of imagination, the liberation of speculation, the meandering paths and loose ends that start in logic and lead to wonder."
228," Russo Brothers, what did you guys do?
","What have you done? What were you thinking? 21 movies in and this is the best you can come up with?
I'm not sure where to start. Have you worked so long on all these films that you got burnt out? Do you hate the Hulk and Thor characters so much that you would do what you did to them?
Time travel to fix things is just lazy writing. Plain and simple. Lazy, unimaginative, boring, and it will always fail to make sense.
Let's just start at the beginning of the film. It's the best part other than how did Captain Marvel finds Tony but we can let that slide. It really does not matter.
Five years later was your first mistake. By doing this you have shown the world is in collapse. People can not move on. Garbage everywhere, everything is in decay. Only Tony Stark has seen to be able to move on and have a child and be happy. Great. This is where it gets bad.
You have made Tony Stark completely selfish again. Just like his first film. He never wants to sacrifice anything of his own to make things right. You gave him a daughter and the second you did that, the second you did that, you had to take her away. You had no choice if you wanted to make it a good movie. That is what he was going to have to lose to fix what had been done by Thanos. But you do not even make it an option.
He stipulates that they can all go back in time as long as they don't change the last five years! Why?! The whole world is in mourning. The world sucks. How many people killed themselves after the snap? How many people lost everything they own after the snap? How many children lost their parents? How many parents lost their children? But Tony is happy, so, that's all that matters. Horrible. You made me hate Tony Stark.
Next point. Why do they need a spaceship to go to Thanos? Thor has Stormbreaker. Stormbreaker can make a bifrost bridge to anywhere! Thor can go anywhere he wants now. Anywhere! No spaceship needed.
Thanos? What did you do to the villain you made so great in the previous film. He has five years in retirement and he's ready to die? Let me explain something to you guys. People do not spend their entire lives to achieve something only to want to die five minutes after they achieve it.
Thanos. Poor Thanos. What you did. Thanos would never, ever just sat there and let himself be killed. He knew when he did the snap that people would come after him. He would have been ready. He would have never of destroyed the stones. They would be his greatest protection.
Now that you killed Thanos and you destroyed the stones, you put yourselves in a box. How can we fix this? I know, time travel. Quantum Realm time travel. Side note, Janet Van Dyne (Mrs Pym) was in the Quantum Realm for 30 years and she aged 30 years. We'll forget about that movie though.
Then you guys think we'll go back and get all the stones from earlier movies. Wrong! You don't have to. All you needed to do was go back and get the Tesseract and the time stone. The Tesseract to travel the galaxy. (Which you really don't need because of Stormbreaker but never mind that) and the time stone to fix the time line. The infinity stones are much more powerful than you guys think or realize. Watch the first Guardians of the Galaxy film if you do not know what I mean.
You guys made the script so much harder on yourselves than you had to be. Maybe this is what happens when people spend too much time on one type of characters.
Did you guys forget who the characters are? Captain America does not look at his own ass and make a comment. He does not care. It is not in his personality at all in any other film. He does not have any vanity. It is one of the reasons that Peggy Carter likes him.
Thor. Poor, poor, Thor. Your lazy writing here is unforgivable. The fat Thor was funny for 15 seconds and then it was irritating for the rest of the film. You should have never of done it. Thor should have been traveling the nine realms with stormbreaker, trying to help those realms recover from the snap. That's what Thor would have been doing. Thor would have tried to do something productive. All of Thor's previous movies meant nothing to you. The character meant nothing to you. How Chris Hemsworth played that part without crying in every scene is beyond me. I hope he was devastated to what you did to his character.
The Hulk? Do you guys even know who he is? You hid him in the infinity wars, it was okay. I got it. It made it different, but not to bring him back or to bring him in the way you did here, is beyond belief. We needed to see that transformation. We needed to see how Banner and the Hulk became one. Okay, forget that, you did let us see Banner in the Hulk form but we never got to see a smart Hulk get revenge on Thanos. A smart Hulk who knows how to fight because he is now smart because you wrote him that he is now smart. Wasted opportunity.
Vision by the way. No resurrection? No mention at all. Really?
Hawkeye? There's a guy that enjoyed the last five years. Maybe Tony would like to lose his family and not to want to change the last five years.
Another problem. After the new snap, when you brought everyone back. Hawkeye's wife came back with her cell phone? He has her cell phone charged and on the kitchen counter waiting for her to come back? Did the cell phone company's service survive the snap? Are you telling me that Clint kept the same cell phone plan for five years? Think about that for a second. And this not something I realized after the film. I realized it as it a occurred, sitting in my seat in the theater. Bad writing.
Romanoff. She never needed to die because you never needed the Soul stone and two things on that: When Captain America returns the the Soul stone, did he see the Red Skull? That would have been interesting. And second when he returns the Soul Stone, Romanoff comes back too! Another thing you guys did not think that through though.
Ant-man? I love Paul Rudd, but Ant man was useless. His daughter does not miss her Mom though? I guess she is like Tony and does not want to undo the last five years.
No Fury and Captain Marvel reunion scene? Why not? Don't really care that it was not there, but hey I should at least mention it.
Back to Captain America. He would never had stayed in the past and married Peggy. He would not have taken her away from the man she winds up marrying and having kids with. He would never had done that in a million years. He would not have abandoned Bucky. Bucky has no family or friends. None. Steve would not have left hm. Steve would not have left all the people that he had met after the snap. Those people still need help.
Let me explain your own script to you. When they reverse the snap and everybody reappears after a five year gap. When Peter Parker goes back to school, half his class is gone. They have all aged and graduated. Make sure you have that in the next Spiderman movie. Plus, the people that came back, did they go back to work? The jobs were still there? How about all the houses that have begun to rot? Who repaired them all? What about people who moved and got remarried? Yeah, let's not remove the last five years. Lets just leave it all intact.
What should have happened is what happens in Marvel movies. It should have been fun. It should have made sense. Captain Marvel, who is really the only one able to hold any infinity stones,should of, with the help of all the other characters, gone back in time. With the use of the time stone and the tesseract. She shows up when Thor hits Thanos with Stormbreaker at the end of Infinity Wars and she cuts off Thanos's arm before he does the snap or takes the glove from him. Then Thor kills Thanos or lets him live for another day and Captain Marvel uses the Tesseract to open a portal and disappear before anyone even gets to ask her a question. Timeline in tack. Captain Marvel returns the Soul stone to a very unhappy Red Skull who is now trapped on Vormir again and Gamora returns from the Soul stone.
Thanos could have been alive and chasing all the other characters. Trying to stop them from undoing everything he had done. Better yet, he should have had an arc and realized that what he had done did not go as planned and in the end he lets them win.
Either way the movie should have ended with Tony giving up his daughter, sacrificing his new family to give everyone else their families back.
After all is done. Captain America could have just retired and passed the mattel along. Tony would have retired too after seeing how great life is with Pepper and then tried to make his daughter again.
All of these endings are better than what you did but they are also not perfect. I just don't have all the time in the world to think up better ways to make other peoples films.
What I do have time though, is to go to movies and enjoy them from time to time and for the last 11 years I have enjoyed most Marvel films. Sadly to say but I think I am done with Marvel. I feel as if you guys, the Russo Brothers have killed it all. All the build up, all the time spending with these characters just so you could change them and ruin them the way you did. I feel as if they have died.
I know my opinion is just that, my opinion. I feel that this movie is this generations Return of the Jedi. I loved Jedi when it came out. 5 years later, I hated it. End Game will be that movie for these young people. They love it now, but give it a few years and we will see.
This I guess is my obituary for the mcu. I felt so empty after seeing this movie. I felt like it was all a waste. I felt like my friends had died or left me and were not coming back. I needed to get this all out of my system and just say good-bye.
I apologize for my poor grammar. If I could get the Time Stone, I would use it to go back to school and actually listen to my English teacher.
This is all a very sad ending to what could have been a great era of movies."
229," Pure garbage
",If you like spending three hours listening to explosions and ridiculous plot then this is the movie for you.
230," Absolute poorly written garbage, Martin Scorsese was right about the mcu not being real cinema

The end is good but the kill of thanos in the beginning is so bad and get another thanos form another time line i think the main villan is just replace to another and many thing like black widow can't back because it in another time line but we see this green female back??
And when they back in time the director don't give as a master peace if they ask Christopher to help them they film will be like a bomb"

235," Don't believe the hype! 3 hours of garbage...
","What can I say but WOW! This has to be one of the most boring movies that I have ever seen in my life. I loved Infinity War but Endgame on the other hand is utter trash. Way too many fanboys overlooking major plot holes.
Personally I would give it around a 6. However, seeing how many people are giving this a 10, to try restore some semblance of balance, I will give it a 1."
236," Endshame
","For a while, the hype for this movie was built up because it was intended to be the culmination of all 22 Marvel Cinematic Universe films. However, taking a look at it now, all I see is that they were lazy with the writing and went with the most predictable storyline possible and used time travel as an excuse to replay their greatest hits. It didn't feel like an original story whatsoever. There are great movies being made with actual heart and soul and I am deeply saddened to say that Avengers: Endgame is not one of them. It lacks originality and whatever originality there is is simply the writers pandering to the fans (eg. Captain America being able to lift Mjolnir). The entire movie also felt as if they expected the audience to have seen every single Marvel movie before it. What of those who haven't? I seriously don't understand how this movie became the highest-grossing film of all time. And now they are campaigning for it to get an Oscar?!!!!! I have to be honest when I say that it does not have my vote. I grew up with the Marvel Cinematic Universe and these characters meant so much to me and a lot of people. They brought people together and this movie only makes them look like a joke. Especially Iron Man, Black Widow, Thor, and Hulk. The Russos thought they were being funny by making Thor into Santa Claus. Well, if they were going in that direction, they might as well have sent him to the North Pole and have him use the Bifrost to send presents to kids every Christmas!!! More efficient than using a sleigh with 9 reindeers!!! No elves needed (proven in Thor: The Dark World which they keep trying to remind us happened). As for the Hulk, he was even more useless in this film than in the previous film! I don't know what they were thinking. When did Shrek get a PHD in physics??? And Thanos at the beginning was just a rip-off of Two-Face from The Dark Knight, a movie that, need I remind you, DID win an Oscar. Might as well have Nebula walk casually out in a nurse costume as the Avengers facility was blown to kingdom come. And don't even get me started on Black Widow's death!!!! They basically just rehashed Gamora's death from Infinity War. Like, did they even get Ross Marquand to come back as Red Skull or did they just use archived footage. Black Widow was a character we as Marvel fans grew to love and relate to because she was damaged, she had demons. She as a character that we as fans who have our own struggles could relate to. And she deserved a better death than that. She didn't even get a proper funeral!!!! That just makes me so mad 😡 !!!! And then Iron Man, The Godfather of the MCU!!! They shouldn't have done that to RDJ. In the film, he starts out in space like he did in the first trailer for the film and then in the actual film, it's only true that he will die in space for, like, two minutes. That is, until, surprise, surprise, Captain Social Justice Warrior comes to the rescue! I mean, she can fly through space and shoot plasma beams but she can't even hold out on her own against Thanos without his mirror-image kitchen knife!!! Even Wanda Maximoff gave him a literal run for his money and when she lifted up Thanos, she didn't look like she was struggling at all, she was all ""please keep all arms and legs straight and enjoy the ride cause you gonna die for killing my Red Tornado rip-off boyfriend."" That final battle has its cringeworthy moments: like that all-star ladies team-up but I've seen grannies walking into a book club meeting look more intimidating than them. I mean, what the hell was Mantis there for? Was she gonna be their cheerleader? If so, where were her pom poms (Ohhhhhh, the actress's name is Pom...Klementeiff. And was that supposed to be funny, Kevin?). Then there was the funeral scene, with everyone acting like the president had died or something. I mean, I bet you Drax didn't even remember who it was that died to begin with and was probably asking himself why everyone was so sad while Aunt May was getting Happy's number (probably when they started dating). And Nick Fury saw the funeral and he was all ""well, I'm done with this planet. I'm gonna ask Carol about that new hairdo cause it's not doing her any favors"" while Carol was all ""I rescued him from space for this?!!"" Nebula was probably even wondering who to play paper soccer with and Wanda was probably wondering whether or not she had to stay in her room. Then you have the Old Man Rogers debacle with Bucky and Sam all like ""oh, yeah, you invented time travel, that's cool, we're just gonna pretend like that's normal and all"" and Bucky thinking ""well, looks like I'm the sidekick now"". Plus, what about all the stuff about the Infinity Stones and branched timelines that the Ancient One was babbling on about. Did everything she said suddenly not matter because it was Captain America? It feels like they only brought in familiar faces because they thought it would look cool in the final battle. The way this movie went down, you would think that the final battle was the ONLY thing that the Russos directed. And the way they opened the film was just so random you didn't know if it was just another sneak peek or not, I mean, of all Avengers, why start with HAWKEYE?!!! I get that they wanted to show the scope of the impact that Thanos had with his Snap but to start with HAWKEYE?!!! They should have left that scene in Infinity War and opened the movie with Carol arriving on Earth or something. There is so much to point out about this movie that it is just exhausting. It feels like another attempt by Hollywood and Disney to make a cash grab and let everyone know that Big Brother (Mickey) is watching and controls all. Not too difficult to imagine an army of Mickey Mouses marching and saluting dear leader (Bob Iger)."

241," Meet Avengers 3D: Disastrous, Dumb, Dull
","Rated over 8? Am i missing something? Most of the movie is filled with tedious flashbacks and boring confessions from the heroes. In fact, there were so many heroes that my head almost went dizzy, I was expecting someone like Mr. Spongebob or Tom and Jerry to appear at any moment. Maybe it could actually make the movie a little less boring.
The plot was so ridiculous, so embarassing... Same flat jokes, same senseless pathos from all the previous parts, and ZERO logic. They figured out they needed to travel in time, went to Stark, he said its impossible, blah blah... then he sat down for one evening, had another dull sentimental dialogue with his wife and guess what - he made a time machine in one day. Yep. (Oh, and at the same time he also made the exact copy of Cap. America's shield. So basically, if the only special thing about Cap. America became casual, what is even the point of that character's existence?)
In the end, Avengers is just like Transformers: a seemingly never-ending franchise with lots of CGI and the same plot in every sequel. But this time, hopefully, it's the endgame of this horrible money grab of a series. Just dont bother watching it. Please."

",A garbage with full of unpleasant characters and boring story and i call that a real charlatanism to stole your money and giving you a 3 hours long headache with minimum suspense and bad cgi and nothing more. i hope we never saw that characters anymore and never have such garbage anymore.
245," A good movie but nothing new to offer.
","Endgame, The Flash (TV Series), and Legends of Tomorrow (TV Series) has many similarities and that bothers me the most. Felt like they stolen the idea & concept of time travel directly from The Flash story line. A big fan of Infinity War. It had original ideas and it was well executed. But I cannot say the same for Endgame.My Rating 6/10"
246," Incredibly overrated
","The only good thing about this movie is the nostalgia of old marvel movies,the time travel logic is stupid and its extremely boring just 2 hours of people morning then 45 minutes of cgi,its a disgrace to movies for this movie to be this high"
247," Why?
","I hate how people are saying that this movie is epic, and that all the movies that preceded it were epic as well. There have only been a handful of Marvel movies that have actually been good, and this is not one of them.Marvel, like The Simpsons, has run out of ideas and is now running off of a therom. If it has the word marvel in it, then it will sell. The story does not matter only the name, and it's finally starting to show, as it has for The Simpsons for years now. And the announcement of new movies is now no longer exciting for me.Marvel honestly needs to take a step back and take their time in producing movies, as well as shows now too, like some of their most fantastic movies and shows, like the original Iron Man, Guardians of the Galaxy, Ant-Man, and even the Netflix Daredevil, which was surprisingly good and did a great job portraying the character. What the executives at Marvel don't seem to understand is that they in fact are not Epic, they're just putting trash out and unfortunately the masses are gobbling it up. Things become like goats, they'll eat anything that you put in front of them.End game is one of the most unimpressive movies I've seen in a very long time. I cannot believe that I wasted almost four hours of my life watching this horrible, sad excuse for a superhero movie, if you could even call it that. The only great thing about the past few Marvel movies is the memes that have come out of it. The Russo Brothers Legacy will be the memes that were made from their movies, not the story itself nor the movies. Just because you have the lucasfilm lighting, as well as the CGI company behind you does not make you amazing. What makes anything amazing, story-wise is a good story. End game doesn't even have that! They paid Robert Downey jr. 75 million dollars for the only good scene in the entire film, and it only lasts a couple of seconds. What a waste of money.For the love of God stop going to see Marvel movies and teach them a lesson to stop making horrible movies they aren't even superhero movies anymore. Stan Lee is gone, even when he was alive he didn't stop these terrible movies from being made, because he believed in Marvel and that it could change the world. In the beginning it did, with the Tobey Maguire Spider-Man's, Iron Man, and all of these amazing Marvel films that were actually well done and good. Stan Lee near the end, just produced these films because that's all that he knew to do. He inherently trusted these people to make great movies, and honestly they failed him and failed the original image of Marvel. Only the comics have stayed true, and even then they've come to PC for my liking, and it's so sad. Marvel won't be getting any more of my money. Hopefully you won't be giving any of yours to them anymore either. I am tired"
248," utter garbage
",Wost movie ever seen total waste of time no action no nothing just bad bad bad bad
249," dont know why it got so much praise
",Marvel man you were ok when you weren't practically wearing mouse ears on your logo but this is a super hero movie and I'm sorry but what was with the reveal of thanos??? I mean if sonic the hedgehog got so much bac lash for its design then marvel should have been working around the clock but no the big bad that we waited 6 years for him to do some damage is a friggin grape this is just snoke form the last Jedi all over again I mean honestly what is with marvel and the black widow love interest I mean yea she's hot but is she with Bruce or hawk eye pick a lane!I mean you know how this is going to end someone has to die and yea i guess people feel for him but lets say someone like star lord honestly he would be a better fit because its all his fault but no we kill off a main character that was so funny and has a cute daughter star lord saw his mother die and got abducted by aliens when he was like eight before he even had time to grieve. Also were do you go when you dust off did anyone else ever think about that I wrote a parody of Gilligan's island about that and did anyone else think that the rat who let Antman out was just mickey in disguise saying be funnier (fake laugh) you didn't make me enough money(fake laugh)because people were grieving over infinity war deaths(fake laughter) man even tonys wife was like ha I aint kiss those crust lips that's why she kissed his bloody burnt face and she hesitated too.

","The writers went to far with this one.Somethings wrong with today's society,for ppl to even consider this garbage as one of the greatest films ever made with an of 8.5 is a disgrace.8.5?????seriously,this film is an abomination to marvel fans and the entire human race,there was no love and passion done with this it was only for money.I hate this film and I especially hate the writers who did this,this couldve been the greatest of the greats."
252," Terribly overrated
",I know there are a lot of hardcore Marvel fans out there but it baffles my brain that this movie gets the praise that it gets. Infinity War was a decent movie but Endgame is pretty bad. Iron Man and Spiderman were great. The Dr. Strange reveal where you realize this is the exact thing he predicted as the only successful way to defeat Thanos was actually pretty darn good. What throws it off is the Disney political correctness. What the actual f*$k was that girl power scene towards the end? It made me so unbelievably un-immersed it is insane. I don't truly believe this is a 1/10 but imma give it a 1/10.

","As Avengers and Iron Man big fan, I'm writing this review, and I'm tryna watching this movie first time at home. Well, if in the cinema I was waiting something great, second time I'm knew there's nothing. Some sad scenes and dramatic tear-jerking, dear directors, are you serious? It's super hero movie not a drama come-on! Directors of this movie attempted to create Santa Barbara. Action scenes very poor like in low budget movies. There's no some great Iron Man's suit regeneration, or other new features. Just couple seconds of poor action with Tony Stark awaits you. If you need love line between Natasha and Archer, maybe it's worth watch it, otherwise no"
262," Real review!!
","This is not like the rest, paid for review, this is honest!! As a fan of Captain America since the 80's, I have grown to hate the Avengers movies, this one & Infinity War!!! They have become so unbelievably unbelievable it's pathetic!! This one starts days after Infinity War ends & the ""rescue"" of Iron Man by Disney's new, ultra strong (stronger than a god for Disney) Captain Marvel!! She never existed in any other Avengers movie as people know!! After helping him get home, she basicutakes charge & leads they remaining team to Thanos & guess what, they kill him & Thor is the one that does it with Caption Marvel basically in control of Thanos!!! Then it moves 5 years in the future & they decide to time travel since Ant Man returns & tells them about it!! They get the team back together but find Thor looking like the Dude from the Big Lebowski!!! He is also a drunk & an over weight slob, (this is Disney mind you, supposed to be for kids)!!! They try to get Iron Man but he has a family now & refuses, only to join in as everyone knew he would!!
Let's fast forward an hour to they time travel & get the stones with Black Widow giving her own life to get the soul stone!! They get back to headquarters & Hawkeye, who is the main focus for some reason tells them she's dead!! They have a moment of silence & move on like that!!
We move to the final hour & the final fight with Thanos from the past. None of the Avengers can handle the gauntlet glove they make & are getting beat, almost get destroyed until Disney's new, stronger than a god Caption Marvel shows up & destroys Thanos ship by herself!! She pretty much takes charge again, beating the crap out of Thanos, not even a god could do what she was doing!! The rest of the ""hero's"" show up that were ""killed"" in the last & tony puts his own life at risk by taking the stones & using them to end Thanos the sameway he used it in the last movie!! It ends with a memorial for Tony & Steve taking the stones back in time to where they belonged in the past, before Thanos got them the first time!! When you think about it, they did not stop Thanos because to do that, they would have needed to kill his mother or killed him right after birth, so think on what will still happen!! There is also no sign of Disney's super duper hero because she is not needed to save the others, including a god!! After Steve put the stones back, he went back to 45 & stayed, only to show up in the 2020's as an old man who is over 100 years old & looks like he's in his 70's!!!
You see the screw ups? It starts with the first Iron Man movie!! They put him in modern times & that can't be!! Why you ask, Howard Stark & Tony's mother would be in their 70's by the time Tony is born!! In this movie, Tony goes to 1970 & sees his dad & his dad even mentioned that Tony was not born yet!! Howard, if you know his back story, was working on the Captain America formula for the government in WW1!! That means, he would have been born in the 1890's!!! By not staying with the original material, you get everything out of wack!!!
Let's move to Thor, he's a god as I made clear already, that means he is not a mortal & can't die, means he is the most powerful of the Avengers but he can't stop Thanos for nothing & an earthling that is Carol Danvers can handle Thanos like he's nothing?
Disney has not only failed with these movies but has ruined Marvel movies that could have been good!! The mindless Disney drones do not want to see these facts & think Disney has done great!! It's past time these movies ended & Disney is removed from everything they are involved with except what Disney started as, a family owned & family oriented company!!!"
263," RDJ Disrespect heath ledger during oscar
",I hate to see iron man in this movie frankly because of his real life character.
264," Half this movie is boring, emotional dialogue, unlike the first part all action!
","I have watched the first part many, many times. Every minute of it was accounted for with importance to the plot - not wasted on snowflake emotions.This second half has an excellent plot, but oh, my - how it dragged on with talk and tears!I also didn't like Pepper suddenly being outfitted as a fighter?! lol! And, considering the future hero roles revealed in this one, can we eventually expect a white Black Panther, too?! Don't get me wrong - I don't want to see a white Black Panther.Several other points of disappointment, too.Bummer."
265," Mistakes!!!Too many to even count..but I'll try
","I can't believe we just sat and watched this movie. There are a million different problems with this movie. Be advised we have watched all of the other Marvel movies, and have begun watching them over again with our children, and we feel totally disappointed with this last installment. I could go on forever on how it doesn't make any sense and is so disjointed... Spoilers ahead.
1. Why were there no paradoxes with the amount of interaction Thor had with his mom, Tony Stark had with his dad, and Captain America had with himself? Even Nebula met herself and then killed herself...Why didn't it impact or change anything in the future?
2. How come Tony Starks' daughter still exists if Thanos didn't get a chance to kill everyone in the first place? Wouldn't that negate the other off shoot time period?
3. How come Gamora was alive for a moment,(she lost her life due to Thanos in Infinity War) but Black Widow (who lost her life as a part of the same ritual)was dead dead? Never to return again?Other troubles:4. How come selfish Hawkeye gets a happy ending with his family after he killed his friend, and also went on a killing rampage prior to getting everything back?
5. Why did they ruin Thor and Hulk? They made Hulk the ""smart hulk"". He was straight up annoying. Thor was plain out childish. Why does the chosen ruler of Asgard, choose not to rule Asgard, and instead gives the job to Valkyrie, if not to merely push the feminine agenda and female power movement we are currently in?
6. Why did they make all the females go up against the army, alone at one point during the battle without males? Again, it felt like a commercial.
7. Assuming Captain America stayed in the past implies that there are two Captain America's in that same timeline. Eventually, it would cross over to the time when Captain America unfreezes. This would imply he is living his life in secret with Agent Carter, but then that doesn't make sense, because the old Captain America ends up on that bench in the ending timeline in an old man's jacket.
8. How come Captain Marvel doesn't age? She has been the same age since the 1990's. This wasn't explained in the movie. Although not a big concern, but something to note.
9. How come all the characters had no depth to them whatsoever, even those we have come to know and love? They were all one note and disjointed. None of them acted in the same way they had in previous movies.
There are many more plot holes and disappointing elements, but these are the ones that primarily stood out. I realize it has been explained away by saying there are multiple timelines, however the multiple timelines argument, will not give me back the three hours we wasted by watching this movie. We really hoped it would get better as time went on, only to find out it was about to get worse. So disappointing!! A big let down."
266," good but could be better
","Hulk, a strong,manly hero was reduced to a teddy bear.
Thor-a cry baby.
This is marvel's way to fight with ""toxic masculinity"" in my opinion.
Also time travelling is like cheating. Time travel, kill the bad guy, save the day, come back to home and drink beer.
This movie isn't an 1 but also isn't anything above 8."
267," Horrible!
","The worst movie in the world.
the movie goes from being a superhero movie to a comic. Full of errors, ridicule and absurd situations. Horrible!"
268," By far the worst Marvel movie ever made.
","I gave 3 stars because of action scene in last half hour of movie.Lets start with the beginning. avengers are trying to show emotions for first 150mins of the movie. It gets real boring real fast. Everybody is sad & useless. Guys, we get it, your friends are dead, now stop being sad and start showing some passion to avenge.
Hulk has lost its charm of being that wild, mean, funny character.
Thor has lost his planet, his people, his brother, his girlfriend, his parents and he has lost his looks with all the charm he was good for. He gave away his throne too in the end.
Thor also lost something more precious then all of this....Can you guess what? He lost his place in the Marvel universe. Wanna know how? Directors made sure Thor is not the only one who can call up the hammer when he pleases.
Can you imagine anything left for Thor in Marvel universe? I thought so...Captain America can call up Thor's hammer and use it as he pleases. This is the biggest blunder of the Marvel production. Cap has no magical power and he sure as hell is not a God of any place.
Trust me when I say this, when captain America call up the hammer by raising his arm up and hammer came to him ""All the sheeps in the theater were clapping"" . They had no idea, they got fooled right in front of their faces. LOLNow lets get to time travel. Its an idea that any Director/writer uses when they have no story, no sense, no passion, and just want to make money by fooling people. Avengers story writers were stuck and didn't know what to do.
In time travel you can do anything and change any story you want. NOT FUN AT ALL.Another blunder is that Iron-man dies while he had all the power of the universe in his hands. ""Use common sense"". How can the most powerful person in universe dies? I know how, give the story to Marvel universe and they will manage to kill that person without using any logic and people will believe it.This movie shows iron man an old white haired/bearded guy who lives In the cottage. Very weak, Anxiety filled man. where is that full of life, charming, passionate, avenging iron-man? Long gone after he got married....Marvel universe has changed the meaning of Action movie in to an Emotional movie with 2&1/2 hours of whining out of 3hrs of movie.Avengers: End game genre says its ""Action,Adventure,Fantacy,Sci-fi"" they left a Big part of movie genre ""DRAMA""
I urge the IMDB to get the genre right next time so people know what to expect.Infinity war was the best movie of Marvel and Endgame was the worst."
269," Just so disappointed!
","I expected so much from this film but just feel so disappointed by it. A poor and incoherent story with so many contradictions within it plus a total waste of my favourite character - amongst others (like Thanos himself). I did go and rewatch it in the cinema a second time and realised that, without all the excitement and expectation I went in with the first time I was just really really bored.It did have some nice ""moments"", especially the anticipated big fight towards the end. Some characters get a good inning - love Antman and, of course, Iron Man but this is my least favourite MCU film.And the ending...........sigh!"
270," Meh
",Love most of the marvel movies so far (except captain marvel) but this was a total let down :(

","It missed some feather for thor. Maybe a cooking scene with Hulk.
Would like to see a shower scene but just for the bubbles not for the actors.
No really... was it a joke.
Didn't get the buzz for this crap. Not so innocent as it seemed in its poor hidden messages anticipating the future makeover of the Marvel universe... and it's fall.
Sign me out."
273," Unbelievable boring, lacklustre, rip off of loyal fans.
","How can Marvel, the Russo brothers as well as the scriptwriters go from delivering the best superhero movie ever made, Avengers Infinity War, to offering such trite tosh as Endgame? I was so disappointed that I almost threw up. I suspect at the end of the day they ran out of ideas and thought its gonna be a great way to fool us fans by offering us the final movie to make an extra billion by putting together what seemed like the worst outtakes of a b unit.!"
274," No... Just no
",I haven't watched the movie. It just doesn't deserve 8.7
275," OMG long boring and ztupid
",Godawful movie. Took itself too serious. The girlpower bit was groan out loud cringe. Fat thor pointless. Half a hulk just annoying. Ending was longer than lord of the rings. Big fight scenes awful cgi. Everything got thrown at the screen and none of it stuck

",Watch it honestly. My 5th grade sexual harassment class had more relevance then this. And I made the mistake of buying it.

I am ashamed to contribute towards this movie's box office record.PS: I am not a dumb merican who likes stupid action without a story. Disney has ruined movies no one will make quality movies anymore just idiotic superhero stuff.
279," Ridiculous
","After the pretty decent Infinity War, here is this one. What a disappointment! While Thanos is supposed to fight with Eternity, Order, Chaos, the gods from Asgard, from Olympus, we see a fat ""god"" of thunder saying silly things, and some stupid time travelling arcs.Wasn't it smarter to give a call to Rama-Tut?Plus, how can the Avengers hope some victory without Norinn Radd and Warlock?This makes no sense. Plus, we got superheroes who never wear a mask, and some ridiculous shots of super-girls. We're happy to see that wearing an armor from Stark's requires no special ability or training."
280," What a pain

It's movies like this that makes me lose faith in the art of film making. And the rating 8.7 just makes me wanna stop talking to people. What a waste of money...
284," Bad reboot of Avengers: Infinity War
","OMG! What have I just watched? Remake of Avengers: Infinity War?The last installment of Avengers looks like another Infinity War with table turning (this time we won) and introduction of few new elements such as Captain Marvel, Ant-Man and time machine. The rest is pretty much the same: whole lot of super-heroes doing crash-smash-flash-zap-bang super-fictional thing we already seen in earlier Avengers. OK, have to admit CGI is awesome but if you strip that the result is below average movie to watch once and leave in archive (if you mistakenly bought disc).Bottom line, I really don't see End Game as a ""Masterpiece"" just because it filled-up box office emerging on top of all movies. It is not something we have not seen before, no breakthrough, not better than Infinity War. Just good advertising boosted this up on hall of fame scale."
285," The end that never comes.
","Watching Avengers Endgame started as a nice story that soon became boring and predictable. The problem is that it's supposed to end an era, to be a big moment before the curtain fall, but instead tries to pave the way for Marvell phase 4. There were some interesting moments, some funny moments that really made me smile, but at the end it all fell flat. Flat as a rug. They tried to cram each and everyone in the movie, but in my opinion it feels fake, like parading with fake cardboard masks. The CGI-fest soon became boring...except for the de-aging of Michael Douglas, that was 100% uncanny valley material. I was watching it feeling nothing, feeling dead inside. Then the woke trend rear its ugly head. Anyway, it's safe to say that I'll avoid Marvel in the future. The Endgame should stay the endgame. It's time to move on."
286," Utter garbage
","How did they get this so wrong?Absolute travesty, and possibly the most disappointed I've ever been with a movie.Lately disappointment is a recurring theme, with a string of average or outright terrible ""blockbusters""."
287," How brainwashed can a fan person get

","Overrated and slow as hell. I was yawning whole time during first-half, second half was little better. Don't know the taste of people nowadays creating so much hype for an average movie.

293," False ratings, don't pay to see this movie.
","There is no way there can be so many legit 10 votes for the movie. Seems like a hoax to me.It was so bad. Infinity war was way better.I went to see it partly because of the high rating, never trusting imdb ratings again. The studio must have fixed some high ratings to induce ticket sales.Massive waste of time and money."
294," Thanks Russo Brothers for destroying the MCU
","This is the saddest review I have ever had to write. After the culmination of all the films and the Snap at the end of Avengers Infinity Wars they blew it. Fat Thor was funny for about 5 minutes then was just annoying, the Hulk was reduced to a joke quite frankly with none of his anger just stupid glasses. Most of the characters didn't get a look an and the first half of the film was just annoying. When the final fight does happen it is so unrealistic, with characters having bonding sessions as aliens and superheros were fighting all around them. Captain Marvel was in the film for about 10 seconds and destroyed the aliens so easily she made the rest of the characters redundant.
If the Russo Brothers had spent less time trying to get their friends and family cameo roles and more time trying to make the film we deserved it would have been a good thing. I am so disappointed in this movie it has left me heartbroken at the untimely end to what was one of my favorite film series ever.
It is a mess, the time travel was nonsensical, action was limited and the trademark humor was missing.
I have no idea what the writers and directors were thinking.

I went into this movie open minded after hearing everyone tell me how great it was and after the first hour and a half I was bored. It's almost as if Marvel has started to make comedy movies rather than super hero action movies. Now I am fine with having some comic relief but holy hell. For starters, they completely ruined the Hulk and Thor who are two of the most powerful and captivating characters. I don't understand why they just decided to have the Hulk become a big joke of a character but they did. I thought his main thing was that he was angry all the time which made him way more interesting than a science nerd but ok I guess so. Then they decide to make Thor just a slob that drinks beer and plays fortnite. I saw Korg holding the controller and thought to myself ""if they are playing fortnite this movie is embarrassing"" and believe it or not they were. I could not believe it when I saw what they did to Thor. The God of Thunder and King of Asgard has a mid life crisis after losing to Thanos when he has 1000 years of being a battle tested warrior and is now an overweight bum and is that for the ENTIRE MOVIE.
The other thing in this movie that made me mad was that they tried to force all of these character relationships onto the viewer. I do not care about Hawkeye and Black Widows weird romance/friendship because as far as I can see, they are both kinda useless in the grand scheme of things. Honestly they both probably should have died in the first avengers but we will blame plot armor for that one. I also do not care about captain America and Peggy's relationship or Tony Starks new family that is a thing when the movie just jumps ahead in tome 5 years. This is probably because I think Pepper is one of the most annoying movie character of all time.
The last thing I will rant about is the fighting. For a 3 hour movie you would expect to see some cool fight scenes but no. We got a bunch of fast moving shots and a lot of different characters running with the gauntlet. To make matters worse, Thanos was just so not intimidating in the slightest. It's almost as if he stood 0 chance and everyone knew it. Overall this movie was 3 hours of superheroes sitting around telling some dumb jokes that people think are hilarious for some reason and then winning the battle with little trouble.
Other problem with the movie:
1. Bucky should have gotten Captains shield
2. Time travel? Really. Stark figures out time travel in 30 minutes after 5 years of sitting around and it works without any problem besides when captain America fought his past self and somehow nobody in the building saw it.
3. Thor joining the guardians is cool but also WTF
4. Captain Marvel should have just stayed with the avengers and try to fix the problem rather than run off to other planets and come back at very convenient times. Total cop out
5. The hulk should have fought thanos. Total blown opportunity"
297," Just too much
","Mild spoilers ahead:
This movie could lose some 60 minutes and nobody would notice (or probably will - it would be more fun). Some great acting wasted. Exponential comic absurdity mixed with cheap philosophy. SFX could be much better for such an epic attempt. Weepy ending with forced pathos ruins everything. I was truly glad when it finally was over. 3 stars for wrapping this up, hopefully for good."
298," Ending in an ending
","As much as we might miss some of the characters who died in Infinity war, this avengers movie was not necessary. The story ended perfectly in last movie.
I feel that this was an effort to bring back lost characters for whom most of the little boys and girls cried for in last movie... and in doing so, making tons of mistakes and dynamics change that made it near unwatchable.
As much as it upsets people, Thanos was always right. And this was just a sad attempt in making him the unreasonable bad guy... sad."
299," It looks great but very plastic and no real content and the story is bad
","I don't know if I would like to go to another marvel film after that - the writing was really bad!
Why did Captain Marvel didn't do that instead of Iron Man? She is pure energy...
Why did Dr. Strange didn't opened a huge portal for Thanos and took them elsewhere?
Or more simply why no one let Strange the time-stone and he just make a milion years go by on Thanos army.
What happened to Thanos' ideology of saving the universe? Suddenly he just wants to destroy it?"
300," This is totaly stupid movie
","Oh my God! This movie is horrible... stupid story.
They ""stuffed"" all the superhero characters, but why? The story did not better because of it. Confused, silly movie. I hate it."
301," A total let down
",When you start including time travel it totally messes up the movie --- I mean there is no end it then.
302," The Russo brothers and Marvel outdid themselves with this one, if you thought Infinity Wars was the worst superhero movie, or that Captain Marvel was pretty bad this is much w
","This is the worst superhero movie that I've ever seen since Avengers Infinity Wars, Captain Marvel and the reboot of Fantastic Four. All of those movies are masterpieces compared to this heaping pile of trash.The only good thing that has come out of this movie is the memes. The pacing is agonizingly slow, the story honestly doesn't make much sense at all. The fact that the Russo Brothers and Kevin Feige himself have to spoon feed you how brilliant and amazing this movie is goes to show how.bad it truly is.The characters that we all once knew and loved have now become boring, robotic sleeves to Disney. They are just there for a paycheck at this point, and boy did they get a huge one for some lackluster, boring and honestly some of the worst performances I've seen on screen in my 24 years.Get ready to see Robert Downey jr. Acts like he is in a high school play with his children, the only genuine father figure that actually seems real is Jeremy Renner in this film, otherwise it is ridiculously boring, full of potholes, and it's just a giant flashback and re-use of old footage that honestly gave them material that they should have used differently.I'd like to say that we as Marvel fan's have been strapped in a chair. We can't move, the room is dark, and then Kevin Feige and The Russo Brothers turn on the blinding lights and all walk in with spoons in their hands. They then proceed to, one by one, spoom feed us things like ""This movie is a masterpiece."" ""The reason why that didn't make sense is because we forgot to put it in."" "" We're so talented. Please waste your money on our talentless, bland films that we only make to make toys, merch and statues that people pay thousands of dollars for."" "" We haven't completely checked out and are desperate for new talent."" As you slowly lose conscience and black out.If you're looking to be in pain, by all means go and see this movie in the theater, but if you'd like to skip the boring Parts like I did, rent it on DVD. It's not worth buying nor is it worth watching more than once as some people have. To those people, I pray that your brain's get better >¤<"
303," Totally overrated!! Terrible film with several plot holes
","Terrible movie. I have never been a big fan, of Marvel and even less of MCU, but there were several good movies within that universe.... but this one as the Infinity Gauntlet, destroyed all.... No sense to talk about, the respect of the comic source.... but Stan Lee, Jack Kirby, Steve Ditko, and many others involved on their comic origin of the characters has to be suffering in hell seeing how their creations were terribly undermined....... but just analizing from a cinematographic point of view, this film has a terrible argument, script, direction and very poor characters.... 2 hours of the film were not needed, and all the structure that were builded for this collapsed with this ending. Plot holes and nonsense everywhere.This film represents what social media can do.... in a bad way. Stay away, if you can."
304," Truly this is better than Taxi Driver
","Burn you Scorsese Blurays for another marvellian mass production... ummm... product is here! Let's get some CGI going, so happy we do not understand even the basics of the human psyche. Let's make sure no-one does! Let us judge everyone for we are truly better. Let's keep that PC flag flying high. Let's not see anything that it real, let's polish the world. We all hate real movies. Alpa Chino truly stands for Booty Sweat. Thank you so much!"
305," A very bad written film.
","Yes, you heard it right. It was very badly written. Like the time-travel system is so weird. They tried to be unique with it but failed."
306," An underwhelming conclusion to an epic saga
","I am a long time fan of the MCU. I had a lot expectations going into this film. But Avengers: Endgame was a complete letdown. It was very hard to live up to the hype that the movie generated. But it could've been done in a much, much better wayI'll start off with what was good in the movie. The technical details were amazing, in true Marvel fashion. The background score and visual effects were almost flawless. It started off well, with good pacing, and the final battle scene was really well done. There were a lot of moments, especially during the time travel portion of the movie, which pay tribute to 11 years of Marvel films and it genuinely shows us the legacy that Marvel created.That brings me to the bad parts. Endgame seemed to be dedicated to these moments. As nostalgia invoking as these moments are, they do absolutely nothing to further the plot of the movie. I also felt that the tone was too humorous for a movie about people dealing with heavy loss and defeat. The time travel rules of Endgame, which creates an alternate reality rather than affecting the main timeline, felt a little too convenient as it prevents their actions in the past from having any effect on the present. The movie got a little slow in the beginning and I was bored during this portion. I have never been bored watching a Marvel movie and this says something about the epic conclusion to the Infinity saga. But the pace picks up during the time travel portion.Coming to characterisation, Tony Stark was the only character who had a proper arc. His relationship with his family along with the amazing performance by Robert Downey Jr. made his ending all the more heartbreaking. Steve Rogers strapping on his broken shield and standing up to Thanos in his 'I can do this all day' manner was a reminder of why we love him. But his ending was forced and completely betrayed his character. Even Chris Evans' performance (honestly I can't even imagine anyone else playing Captain America) cannot save Steve Rogers from bad writing. We have seen him say goodbye to Peggy in Civil War. And after five or so movies of not even mentioning her, Peggy is his only way for a happy ending? This is a complete disservice to Peggy's character which was developed in Agent Carter. We see Steve pining after his long lost love rather than mourning his friends whom he lost in the snap. This completely discredits the relationships he formed in the 21st century and his relationship with Bucky. Thor was shown to be completely depressed and lonely. After what he has been through, this is completely justified. But he contributes nothing to the team despite being one of the original six Avengers and the fat jokes started becoming distasteful after a while. He was a well loved character among the fans and the writers didn't even give him a proper conclusion. Natasha's character was treated horribly. Hell, she didn't even get a proper funeral. Hawkeye having a family helps us connect more with his character. But that's all his character has got going for him. Professor Hulk felt kind of bland. I missed his trademark anger which was portrayed so well in the previous movies. Nebula, Rocket, Scott Lang and Rhodey had pretty good characters despite not having much of an arc. The female characters (besides Natasha) didn't have much importance to the story and I felt that the final showdown with all the female characters was put there as a part of a political statement more than anything else. Don't get me wrong, I love strong female characters. But spending a whole movie without giving them enough screen time and then showing a badass 2 minute sequence with all of them is not female representation. Even Captain Marvel, being one of the strongest heroes, had very less screen time. And finally coming to Thanos. Thanos was a nuanced, relatable and, at some points, reasonable villain in Infinity War. But all that character development regresses in Endgame. In Endgame he is presented as a generic villain who is evil just for the sake of being evil.Endgame had its moments, but as the epic finale to which 22 movies have been leading up to, it is a complete letdown. Given, that to make a movie with proper characterisation and character arcs for so many characters in under 3 hours is a hard feat to attempt, but we have seen Marvel do it before with Infinity War. Endgame was all lazy writing and cheap fan service. It could have been the epic conclusion, the fans and the characters deserved but it ended up being a huge mess of wasted potential."
307," This boring marvel film is not right for you, the director/writer wants to steal your money for no story.
","Don't trust the highest scores, trust the bad review. It's waste three hours film and bad storyline (not make any sense and confused). I don't understand why people likes it, I didn't cry or laugh but felt sleepy.Here are the few things that I don't like the movie
1. Too many superheroes against baby Thanos.
2. Timeline - That is cheating and all the superheroes stills lose.
3. It's not an action film, it more likes drama/sci-fi film.
4. Natasha (black widow) didn't have to die, she should uses Red skull.
5. Thor and Hulk are lazy and they are no need to be in the film and possibly the other superheroes.
6. What is Rocket doing? Why did he need to travel in time?
7. Ironman didn't have to put the glove on but use the remote control to snap the finger.I can't think of what else to write here but if you want to watch this, it's better to wait for rental dvd/digital to save your money."
308," 1/10
",This movie is so boring.Too many unnecessary details.You have to sit in movie for 3 hours so i dont think its worth it.I waa dissapointed and really sad after watching it.Dont waste your money and this movie doesnt deserve anithing accept 1.
309," Boring
",I can't believe this movie has as high a rating as it does. This movie was so slow! It was more a drama then an action movie. You just had sad characters crying for the first two hours.And don't get me started on the time travel paradoxes. Time travel stories are for simpletons that can't write anything good.
310," What happened to Thanos?
","There are many reasons why this movie sucked.... Im a guy who liked Infinity war 1 and had expecations fo the second movie.
Everxthing in this movie was fine except one little detail... the story. And without a good story a movie is worthless....Lets rescue antman by a rat which is just runnig over buttons randomly...
The writters put a lot of Work inside this Idea for sure.Oh and bad character development.I enjoyed it that it wasnt about good vs evil in the first movie. It was kinda good vs guy who think he is doing the right thing...
They just throw that thing away.... In the end Thanos Just want to erase everyone... And why? Just because of dient work out the First time to erase half of the existence...
I mean it shouldnt have ended with his success. But Just changing his motive and making him a simple bad guy Shows how uncreative writers had been."
311," Not very good
",How did I not recognize Karen Gillan as nebula !! Funny at times otherwise kinda ridiculous
312," Could have been so much better
","Reaching for the stars, failed to take off from the orbit."
313," Fake reviews
","This entire movie was based on time travel, it's in the same category as Hot tub time machine. It's so awful its embarrassing."
314," Such a let down 😪
","I am a huge Marvel fan and have loved the previous Avengers films so went with high Hope's for this, unfortunately I was disappointed beyond belief. Long, slow, dull scences make up most of the movie with only about 10 minutes of actual action. Main characters are sidetracked for less popular ones and the whole film moves at a snail's pace. It really felt like they had run out of ideas and this is just a money making film. So, so let down and would not recommend.. recommend it to anyone"
315," All Great Things...
","Man! I thought Infinity War was off the hook, but this one...
A perfect compliment to a two part epic. It was what I thought it was going to be, a lot of talk, a lot of planning, but amazingly it was not boring. Not for one second!
Infinity War was the moment we were all waiting for and then they tell us they are going to split it into two films. End Game could have gone south with this choice, but it did not. It's always exciting, especally if you are a comic book fan or have been watching these movies for now eleven years.
Don't want to say too much, but shine a light on Robert Downey Jr. who got to perfect his Iron Man persona to the point where Hugh Jackman can't even surpass him. Captain American is giving all us FanBoys everything we ever wanted to see and Thor...underperforms with hilarious results (and hopefully will create 2019's most popular costume for a certain type of man). Loved Mark Rufflo in this film and Thanos baby, still the baddest villain around.
It's fun it's dramatic, it's like Lord of the Rings with one less movie. Three hours well worth the ticket.
Stan Lee would be proud! Nuff said!"
316," plotholes quantum
",What a waste of fan service. Absolute cringe and quantum plot will blow your mind
317," What???
","What a let down after Infinity War! it felt like the writers was really tired and just wanted to get this over with... Ok I have always had a hard time understanding time traveling, but this one shouldn't have been hard. Of course everyone get it that Marvel wouldn't kill of the majority of their superheroes, that they would come back some how, but I expected more. The feeling of surprise and wonder wasn't there...
Lame ending after the amazing build up in IW. Three hours of my life I never get back."
318," Rubbish!
","After two hours of absolutely nothing happening, I walked away. A complete and utter waste of time and money. How long do you expect me to wait for SOMETHING to happen?"
319," Too long, bad CG, uninteresting plot
","It blows my mind that this movie is rated so highly for how bad it is. It's OK, but it's rated as the #40 best movie as of now. It's just very boring and has no re-watch value."
320," Time Travel Does Not Work For Logic or Dramatic Purposes (spoilers)
","I love science fiction and fantasy, and I have no problem suspending disbelief for purposes of enjoying a good comic book movie, but Endgame just didn't work for me on a couple levels. First, they kill Thanos with little fanfare or drama at what is basically the start of the show. This gets to the whole drama thing, it is all based essentially on a do over, but they try to make it dramatic because they just have ""one chance to get it right"" yet Cap and Tony screw up and just get a do over. So they are fighting to save the world (or half of it anyway) very dramatic, but if this doesn't work they will just do it over, not very dramatic, they beat Thanos at the beginning, again not very dramatic to fight him again.Then there is the time travel logic they use to build up the story that doesn't really work either, you can't change the past, you can just create alternative timelines, but the whole stone thing somehow sidesteps this critical rule ""as long as they put them back in time. And speaking of putting them back, getting them was a major deal involving the whole squad and a lot of risk. How is returning them so much easier? Black Widow ""has to stay dead"" yet Gamora, who died under the exact same circumstances/edict comes back no problem. Fat Thor and smart Hulk didn't help matters. Missed Vision too, everybody else could come back, but not the Viz? Screw that, he is the most interesting character on the whole team.Sorry, don't get all the love, worst Avengers movie yet by far."
321," This was a disasater of a movie
","Avengers Endgame - what a disappointment. Too long, too boring and too sappy. What was I watching - soap opera?
Low on action, full on drama, corny dialogues about friendship and family.
The hall was supposed to be houseful according to bookmyshow and PVR, bullshit, it had less than 1/4 seats full.
Something very fishy is going on.
Totally anti climactic after Infinity Wars and Thor Ragnarok. The direction Marvel has chosen after Captain Marvel and Now this. Seems like films are statistically driven now, with an eye on how to make the film click - by hook or crook.
Captain Marvel - Woman driven, here too there is one scene clearly pushing that agenda. In the last battle there is a shot where all the woman get together for the final fight - just by chance.
The entire focus for this move was, high on emotions, must have done some calculations for that is what the box office collection tell.If I had got an honest review I would have given this movie a skip, you should too."
322," Nope....(Spoiler free)
",Ok. So. Endgame yaaay I am hyped goes to watch starts getting impatient. The pace was wayyyy tooo slow. Maybe this is because it is last movie of Phase 3? The movie was slow paced and then at the end everything rushed. IMO Infinith War was wayy better. I think it shouldve been half of the time length of the 3h.
323," Horrible ending for a long series.
","I can only agree with Martin Scorsese. This isn't cinema. It is worse than watching a documentary.
The whole saga was drawn out for so long, with just awkward feeling movies, and a pitiful ending.
If you think this movie is good, go watch a real movie, like The Godfather or Dark Knights trilogies. If you make more than 3 movies in a franchise, the quality will be just as bad, if not worse than the Fast and Furious series."

","Blade Runner 2049 is a continuation of 1982's Blade Runner a seemingly impossible task. Against all odds and logic, the movie pulls it off.The Good: The greatest thing about the sequel is simply the story. Without delving into spoiler territory Blade Runner 2049 concludes with an ending that works with an internal logical sense and yet still surprises. There are so many good decisions throughout this production one could hardly list them all. The idea of keeping the cold war and old Iconic brands from the first movie works brilliantly and the overall look and feel of this movie are timeless. Blade Runner 2049 does not try to pigeonhole its narrative into the concerns of today. It does not wink at the fears of today's audience. It is its own self-contained universe telling a story that will work fifty years from now and would have worked just as strongly fifty years ago.The acting is strong across the board with Harrison Ford appearing as if he actually wants to be in the film (and looking fit to boot). Also, Ana de Armas needs to be in every movie moving forward. A truly star-making turn.
The Bad: A combination of a long running time, a leisurely pace and a soundtrack from a health spa can put one in a catatonic state if one is not careful. I confess a strong ending brought me back into the film It was losing me for a while there.In Conclusion: This movie sticks to the ribs after viewing. It seemed even better in retrospect than during the actual viewing (see leisurely pace above). Blade Runner 2049 pulls off effortlessly decisions that could seem disastrous in other films (Jared Leto). In many ways, it is better than the first film and better than it had any right to be. A triumph."
1," Blade Runner 2049 - Movie Review: A New-Age Sci-Fi Classic
","For film fanatics like myself, Blade Runner 2049 is a great film for people to see, regardless if they've witnessed the original or not. On the other hand, if you've never seen the original Blade Runner and are just a casual moviegoer that have thought of the promotion for this film as being an action-packed thrill ride, then I'd have to warn to stay far away from this near three hour motion picture. It's very hard to review this film without getting into specific plot details, but that's exactly what makes this film worth the price of admission alone. For nearly every reason a film fan should be excited about a movie, here is why Blade Runner 2049 is a must see as soon as possible. Before dropping you into this world with Ryan Gosling's character, there is text at the beginning that will fill you in on the history of the events in the past, but even though that information is given to you, your experience just won't be the same without having viewed the first film multiple times and remembering the emotional core of it. Set out on a mission to find something of meaning to the overall story, Ryan Gosling's character (who will remain nameless for the sake of this review) uncovers mysteries and secrets from the past, inevitably involving Rick Deckard. Quite honestly, that's the plot in a nutshell and the specifics of the film will lead to ruining your experience, so let's get technical. If not for anything else, Blade Runner 2049 benefits from some of the best cinematography I've laid my eyes on in years. From the addition of the seamlessly blended visual effects, to the mind- blowing scenery constructed by the entire art department, I have nothing but praise for this film. Whether or not you find yourself enjoying your experience, the visuals alone should have you applauding, due to their incredibly detailed nature. I personally found the overall film to be magnificent, but when certain scenes were dialogue-free and asking you to gasp at the imagery, that's exactly what I was doing, as I feel many audiences members will. Again, without giving anything away, once Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) enters the picture, the way both films sort of interconnect was brilliant in my opinion. It does justice to any loose ends that fans may have wanted in the past, as well as create a new story to gawk at in the process. With a terrifically restrained performance by Ryan Gosling, you'll find yourself sucked into this world as a fly on the wall, as he uncovers these mysteries. With the addition of Harrison Ford giving one of his most sincere and memorable performances, as well as Ana de Armas in a role that really took me by surprise, this film was casted to the nines from beginning to end. Some may complain about Jared Leto and Dave Bautista not being included as much, but I felt as though the served the story quite nicely. In the end, this movie aims to impress Sci-Fi fans across the world, but I feel as though the people who will be looking back on this as a possible classic or at least one of the best sequels ever made, are those who've had the pleasure of indulging in the greatness that is 1982's Blade Runner. I don't say this about films very often, especially when talking about sequels, but I haven't been this immersed in a theatrical experience in quite some time. This is definitely a superior film than the original, it's one of the best films of 2017, and I'll be revisiting it very soon. Blade Runner 2049 is getting a lot of praise and awards consideration from critics and filmgoers across the world, and every bit of it is deserved. Aside from being very long, this is pretty much a perfect film if you don't try to nitpick how it connects and certain questions that aren't blatantly answered. If you know what type of film you're in for, or you've at least seen the original and enjoyed it, I can't recommend this movie enough."
2," One of the best sequels of all time
","Denis Villeneuve, you magnificent world wonder, you did it again!I have seen this film three times in the cinema, in 3D, 2D and 4DX.And one of the things i have noticed with this film, is that it's not the time in the cinema that takes up my time, It's the hours upon hours in between spent thinking about the film, that is the real time consumer. This film left such a deep and profound impact, which i cannot escape. And I've gone back to the cinema twice to be ""tortured"", but it's worth it.It's a dark, mysterious, grim, hopeless, sad and lonely film, set in a possible near future where the human race is hanging by their fingertips on the edge of doom. So it's quite depressing. But it's so brilliantly put together, the closest master of cinema i think of that has done something similar, is Stanley Kubrick.Many Stanley Kubrick films were also ""hated"" by many when they first released. ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" for example, which had gorgeous visuals, but felt flat and hollow for many, even professional reviewers back then. But what Kubrick did best with his films, was to create afterthought. People left the cinema feeling confused and even depressed, but the movies planted a seed which then grew for years. The original Blade Runner also accomplished this. BR2049 is no exception, this movie will without doubt live on to be interpreted, analyzed and discussed for decades to come. The story continues from the original, but stands completely on it's own, it tells a new story that directly interlink with the original, but without trying to be a copy, it's a natural continuation in the same universe. You don't have to see the original Blade Runner first, though i do recommend it, see the final cut.BR2049 has some of the most gorgeous visuals i have ever seen, and the cinematography is out of this world, there is literally no excuse not to give Roger Deakins the Oscar this time. After 13 nominations he has now knocked the ball out of the park and is this year in his own league entirely. It's confusing to look at something so gorgeous, whilst painting a picture of such a sad and lost world. It sort of collides with your senses, your eyes say it's beautiful, your mind say it's depressing. Which senses are you going to believe? What does it mean? At least don't confuse feeling depressed as a sign that this movie is bad, it's nothing wrong feeling depressed, take it in, embrace it. Then you will know how it feels to be a replicant that's trapped in a caged mind.BR2049's story happens 30 years after the original, and there is three short films on Youtube i recommend you watch. These short films describes some of what happened in between 2019 and 2049. Watching them makes it slightly easier to understand some of the things going on. But the underlying theme is the same as it was in the original. What does it mean to be human? What does it mean to have memories? What is a soul? And so on.The world has gone darker in 2049, climate is spinning out of control, almost all animals and plants have died. People are desperate and lost, law enforcement can barely keep anything together, and only a small spark can set of total disaster, which is looming just around every corner. Niander Wallace has taken over Tyrell Corp and has by the time 2049 takes place designed millions of obedient replicants that does exactly what he tells them to do. But there is one thing Wallace has not been able to perfect, and that's what the main story is all about, and Wallace will do anything in his power to get his hands on the ""technology"", which will result in him becoming many hundred times richer and more powerful, the sole ruler of the entire universe. He is so far gone in his mind by 2049 he actually believes he is god himself, and he calls his replicants angels.And of course he also uses replicants to do his ""dirty work"". In 2049 we meet his right hand ""girl"" Luv (Brilliantly played by Sylvia Hoeks, if there is one actor in this movie that steal the show, it's her). Luv is a ""handygirl"" so to speak, that perform whatever task she is set to do, with no remorse. Or is that entirely true? I can't spoil anything, but look closely at Luv's character arc. All the other actors also do an outstanding job in this film, no bad performances, but i can't talk about all of them due to the word limit in these reviews.Be prepared going to see this film, it's depressing and heavy on your mind, and it demands your full attention. It's one of those rare films who dares to challenge the audience, and by doing so, taking a huge risk, and a 155 million dollar risk at that. The film isn't perfect, but it's close, and it shows the tremendous skills of Denis Villeneuve. And those few mistakes this movie have, are probably just happy little accidents as Rob Ross would have put it. This film is very much like a painting, every stroke of the brush matters, and every little detail is carefully crafted, it takes monumental skills to pull it of.I loved this film, it's the best film I've seen all year, It is a must see, a monumental triumph of a film that's just as good (possibly even better) as the original and one of the best sequels of all time!9.7/10 - MasterpieceAnd BTW Villeneuve's next movie might be Dune, imagine if he brings Deakins and the rest of this team to make that movie. Yeah, I'm going to leave you with that thought. This is basically porn."
3," Beautiful Atmosphere and an Interesting Mystery Help Blade Runner 2049 Continue a Classic Story
","I've only seen the original Blade Runner once and it was a long time ago. I liked it but I just haven't got around to revisiting it. I mention this because even though I'm not a die-hard fan of Blade Runner, I still found the plot of 2049 engrossing. It's a well put together mystery, I found that they constantly took the plot in unexpected directions and other than the trailer spoiling the return of Deckard, I was always excited about what was going to happen next. The movie pulls an excellent bait and switch at the end that really surprised me. They made the right decision to not repeat the formula of the first one and take the story to a new place. They also create some compelling subplots which is something that few movies get right.The biggest star of this movie is the cinematography and the excellent work of Roger Deakins. The original was noteworthy with the special environment that Ridley Scott and his creative team brought to the screen. That was continued here if not improved upon. The look of L.A. in 2049 they decided to go with isn't completely distinct but it was a little more understated (I'd compare it to the 2017 Ghost in the Shell but less fantastical). My favourite scene might have been a shootout in a defunct club where the lighting and the background show are turning on and off. I don't hesitate to praise when a movie looks good but this is an exemplary example of using visuals and atmosphere to help build on a strong story.Blade Runner 2049 returns very few of the characters from the original film but they manage to breathe life into this movie through the new ones they created. Officer K isn't the most lively protagonist but he gets an eye-opening character arc that kept me involved. Deckard doesn't appear till later in the movie but he remains interesting and what they decide to do with him makes his appearance worthwhile. I also really liked some of the smaller supporting characters. Sapper really helps kick off the movie, what Joi represents is extremely emotional and Mariette is so mysterious that her involvement brings up more and more questions. Add in that Niander Wallace and Luv make for pretty menacing villains and you have a pretty well-rounded and fascinating script.I don't think that the actors/actresses will be the focal point of the awards attention that this movie will get but that doesn't mean there aren't exemplary performances. Gosling is good as K, he's deliberately robotic and he accomplishes a lot through his subtlety. Harrison Ford isn't in the movie as much as I wanted him to be (he's still one of my all-time favourite actors) but he holds up his end. He works with Gosling well and they have a solid rapport. Surprisingly, I really liked Sylvia Hoeks. She stole a lot of her scenes and I thought she was great even acting against a stacked cast. Dave Bautista showed he has a lot more range than people give him credit for. Jared Leto is in a very Jared Leto role (deliberately weird and hard to understand) but he does it well and although he might be a little creepy, the guy is still a great actor. I also want to credit Ana de Armas, she was distinctly warm and she showed a lot more emotion than I had seen from her previously.There were points in this movie I could have rated this a 9/10 but some small things that I had to dock the movie for. Even with a compelling story, the movie has such a long run time that it couldn't help but drag. There are certain scenes where the movie wants you to really drink in the environment but they could have edited it a little tighter. They also couldn't help but lose me at points through how much artistic flair the utilize. Villenueve is an authority in this area and while I appreciate an artistic approach to this science fiction tale, for me they overdid it a little.I was surprised how much I ended up liking Blade Runner 2049. I think if you're a big fan of the original, you'll love this to bits. This is successful in bringing in the uninitiated but I think fans will enjoy this even more. I haven't been on board for all of Villenueve's films but this is a good combination of his artistic style with enough of a commercial element for the masses. I'd give this somewhere between an 8-9 but with the extremely long run time, I'll give this an 8/10."
4," A sleek, expensive and obedient skin-job
","Blade Runner (1982) was a happy (yet gloomy) accident, involving: a) a young and ambitious director who fought ferociously with studio executives in order for them to let him fulfill his vision; b) a rising blockbuster star who wanted to prove he can also act in a serious movie; c) a crazy Dutch actor who decided to change the script and improvise one of the most memorable monologues in film history; d) a bunch of talented artists who wanted to make a movie that would look and sound different from anything else we had seen before. And most of all, e) a post-Vietnam turbulent era when Hollywood rebels like Coppola, Scorsese and Cimino were audaciously attempting to reinvent the language of cinema, telling stories that mattered and not caring at all about target audiences and marketing trends. As a result, Blade Runner was a box office failure that slowly became a legend, breaking stereotypes like ""good guy kills bad guy at the end"" and dealing with existential agony on an almost metaphysical level; always within the context of a gritty corporate dystopia in the near future.Blade Runner 2049 is none of these things. On the contrary, it's the flawed triumph of a next generation of studio executives, who control the creative process by paying millions to the industry's best of the best, providing they will make something that will take advantage of a successful brand name in order to bring profits to shareholders. If there is one word to describe this movie, it's ""replicant"". Not the kind of replicant who realizes that ""all those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain"" as he dies, but a sleek, expensive and obedient skin-job that will try to entertain you and if it succeeds will return as a sequel that will eventually become yet another franchise. I spent 160 minutes of my life watching a pleasant and perfectly constructed piece of nothing, and I didn't care for a moment about any of the characters or a storyline that was designed without the intention to question and redefine a single thing. All its moments have already been lost in my memory, while the original Blade Runner remains vivid in my mind, as if I only saw it yesterday."
5," Even Worse Than The 15th Marvel Film This Year (And Next.. And Next.. And Next)
",The Force Awakens (2015) + Mr Sandman (the Lullaby 1954) = Blade Runner 2049. I still was bored.
6," It Is Such An Interesting World
","There are so many tech gadgets, there are so many petty women and hot legs, there is a house wife who arranges a threesome for her man, one can own pets, there is free alcohol and so on and so forth... .... yet this movie is so boring and uninteresting.
wow how can it be? It must be the nature of sequels."
7," Bad
","Do you know why this is the worst sequel ever (aside from the crappy sequels from Disney)?
Not only it is too over-long and boring it also makes it beautiful prequel become less attractive to the viewers. That is criminal. Sure, the keywords on IMDB point out the chicks are pretty but that is not enough justification for more sequels or remakes.Hollywood, not every film needs a sequel. STOP."
8," Like Many I Used To Think Scott Ridley And Denis Villeneuve Are Good
","I know better now.These guys have destroyed Blade Runner just to release yet another sequel that should not have been made. Ridley has recently been actively destroying the Alien legacy and releasing subpar non-stories. Villenueve is going from this to yet another unneeded remake, namely Dune.In short, these guys are now in the same league as JJ Abrams, Paul Feig and Michael Bay. That is sad. Blade Runner deserved a better (and lasting) legacy.BR2049 is so long, so boring and so pointless that one really wonders. It boggles the mind that they released an expensive movie that has no point to make and no care to destroy the classicness of Blade Runner.There was a cool headquarters, cool hologram technology and advertising and sexy women. Those deserve points, but what is with the very corny and jaded dialogue? the script was bad and the lines were worse. Compare to the original Blade Runner!People, think twice before attending silly Marvel films, boring Star Wars films and the next 5 Ghostbusters. They are boring and insult your intelligence and their legacy. I am done with these thieving sequels."
9," It is not a complete disaster
","Blade Runner 2049 is not a good film, but it is not a complete disaster. A story that did not need telling and logically failed, an overlong and slow moving narrative and a massacre that makes no sense any longer were countered by original visuals and beautiful women. I will go with a rating of 4/10.The problems with this film is that it has sequeltitis. They came up with it because they needed to make money from a sequel and have no original ideas.
The massacred are peaceful and are farming. Why do it then? The story moves so slowly that the 3 hours seem like 6. The acting is not good, but moderna ctors cannot touch older ones so that is par for the course. When in the original the performance by the chief of police, his goon, the industrialist and the eye maker would rivet and excite or the strong personality of the replicants would make the blood boil here it is a paint by the number series of appearances.With that said the futuristic society is fun to watch. Even more fun is Ana de Armas, the sexy and delicious hooker and even the legs of the Chief (who is old so has short hair unfortunately). These babes add to the vista and architecture that is most pleasing to the eye in this sequel."
10," Strangely boring, lacking tension and intelligence.
","Don't believe the lying shills rating this a ten out of ten. The original Blade Runner is a masterpiece. This film is not. It only deserves a six, but I loved the original so I gave it a seven. My review will compare both films and it contains **spoilers**.First up its pacing. This film is actually much slower than the original, adding up to two hours and forty three minutes of mind numbing boredom. I love slow paced films provided there's enough drama and tension. The first Blade Runner film has long pauses, but its justified. The silence swells toward sudden violence or it occurs because a character is gnawing over a great line of dialog they've just heard or are about to express. So what makes a slow paced film entertaining? The solution is information provided at the right time.The first film immediately tells us that replicants are murderous outlaws. We see one commit murder. Some are hiding here on Earth in Los Angeles and Dekkard is forced to detect and kill them. All that information is given to the audience within the first few minutes. So when Dekkard is wandering through crowded streets of futuristic LA, we the audience are afraid for him, because any one of them could be a murderous replicant. Dear Ridley Scott repeat after me: Information creates tension.This newer film instead begins with long drawn out scenes of dull aimless searching and investigating. Since no villain shows up until the last hour, there's no reason for the hero to actually hurry or feel afraid. When the boring pace finally speeds up toward the end, you're so bored out of your skull, you forgot why anyone is doing anything and you no longer care or even notice what the film thinks is a stunning twist.Those shill reviewers are glowing about its photography. Compared to its budget, the photography is below standard. There are rare nice moments. Seeing the fusion powered spinners (those flying cars) again was nice nostalgia, but far too many albeit pretty shots of -- nothing happening -- rendered the plot all the more irrelevant.Now for the production design. The indoor set designs were poor, telling us very little about the world this film is set in. The ""production value"" looks cheap. I don't mean that in a cheap sleazy film noir way (no that would have been cool), I mean that I don't know where they spent the 185million budget, because only a fraction of that was spent on the sets. Two things did work. The voice comp device has been updated reminiscent of 1984 (the Orwell film starring John Hurt) and there is a Total Recall (the original not the remake) style artificial Female hologram character that is programmed to love K (Ryan Gosling). Interesting, but hardly ground breaking, while the original film was ground breaking in too many ways to mention here. The close up long lens shots in the original made the grimy futuristic streets of Los Angeles really look and feel like a crowded claustrophobic sleazy poverty stricken hellhole. Such a lens also gives size to any character in the foreground making Ford look all the more epic.This film used wider lenses and so the pent up tension of the original street scenes is non existent. In fact very rarely does it venture outside into the streets, so that we cannot breathe in the human polity as easily as we did in the original. The original film had real light emanating from miniature buildings, vehicles and advertising. I'm sorry but computer generated light just doesn't behave like real light does. Real light goes where it wants. The human eye cannot be fooled. Syd Mead is a genius. But looking at this film makes me think he wasn't given the power he needed to bring out this film's potential. It actually looks like some hack is trying to copy him. This makes me feel sad to write that. His work on Elysium (2013) was far superior.And now the acting. Gosling plays it straight (and glum) as he did in the pretty to look at but boring Bangkok crime flick Only God Forgives. There is a plot reason for this, but his dull acting compounds this movie's languid pace. There's not enough of Harrison Ford, who only shows up in the last hour (maybe less?). Jared Leto's monologues are just awful. Its not his fault. He's miscast and badly written.Like Mead, Philip K Dick is a genius too, both films are inspired by his literary masterwork ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep"". This film didn't delve deep enough, barely scratching the intellectual surface. Since many of his concepts are incredibly visually rich that just compounds the cinematic failure here. Should you go and see this? If you're a fan of the original, I think you should. The story ends in a way that sets things up for another Blade Runner movie which I hope will actually be entertaining. This film is meant to be a science fiction noir film, but it has little of the intelligence we expect from science fiction and none of the crime solving tension that is required of film noir. It lacked the brutal immediacy of the original nexus 6 villains the first one had in spades. It lacked the tense cat and mouse hunting game that made the original so intense, a race where the lead changed more than once. It just isn't as clever as its, at times pretty visuals and constantly obnoxious soundtrack, pretends it to be.Instead we get a self important bloated fatware art-house snoozefest that is bleak, boring and about as intellectually deep as counterfeit artificial snake skin."
11," Beautiful!
","I am referring to the thin eye candies. The girlfriend and hooker were positively femininely beautiful and worth the price, but this is not a good movie.

14," Really Pretty But Really Boring
",The graphics are futuristic and impressive. They have created a stylized world that looks impressive - although not as impressive or detailed as the prequel - but the film is so useless and boring.

",".... is only second to American remakes of foreign movies. When Hollywood remakes international movies my house begins to stink.With that said, sequels are a close second and this so-called Blade Runner shows why. In other words, Blade Runner 2049 is contradictory (pretty holographic wife cooking meals and showing skin... yeah earth sucks now, take that off worlders... yeah what a hell hole) and just a cash cow. Ridley Scott has finally ran out of different video versions of the original to release and people are sick of the alien prequels and sequels he kept pushing out (they all sucked) and so he's back here.Get some integrity."

21," Visually stunning but lacks mystique, emotional depth & musicality
","Being a hardcore Blade Runner and science fiction fanatic, I felt deeply compelled to write this review. I love Ridley Scott's original 1982 Sci-Fi classic. It is my all-time favorite movie. It had mystique and infused my imagination. It was a unique experience; hypnotic & surreal. The sequel, not so much! My initial reaction of BR 2049 was that it's a gorgeous film. I was mesmerized by the striking cinematography and couldn't take my eyes off the screen. I will go as far saying that it's one of the most beautiful films I've ever seen. The rich visuals are so glaring it's hard to take it all in and grasp what you are seeing. From the opening shot you know you're in Blade Runner world. The overall look is instantly relatable to the first film and it's an amazing continuation in that regard. Also, the acting was excellent. The entire cast did a great job. However, once I settled into the film I realized that it is mainly a self-indulgent visual feast containing a weak story that lacks clarity & wisdom. There are obvious clich√© moments and in certain aspects the story is comical and naive. The movie delves into complex philosophical themes and asks important questions but seldom explores them. It's all over the place. You get the sense that the film is not sure what it wants to be? It's clearly style over substance. Lots of homage is paid to the original through awesome images but the plot is paper-thin with a few subplots & twists added to make it seem intelligent. But is it? Well, not really! I think the movie tries too hard to be smart but fails to engage due to its long running time & fuzzy story/script, which may end up confusing and distancing the viewer.BR 2049 has been most widely criticized for its length, and rightly so. It's overly long with some unnecessary scenes & dialogue whereas the first film was more subtle. BR1 was also slow-paced but in a different way. It had suspense and gradual progression to climax whereas BR2 is forced and even distracting at times. I love slow-paced films don't get me wrong! I can watch a film all day as long as it leads to a point and has tension. Certain films are deliberately made slow to establish a specific mood (e.g. Kubrick & Tarkovsky films). They draw you inside the film and make you feel like you're part of it. BR1 does this perfectly while the sequel is stretched out for the wrong reasons. It comes across as an excuse to showcase impressive visuals which is great if it moves the story along but not for the fun of it. BR1 had long takes and brief dialogue but it drove the story along smoothly and its characters behaved realistically. There was a seamless flow to it. It's humorous how BR2 tried to mimic this technique from BR1 yet failed because its characters talk & move super slowly unlike real life.Although it's a visually stunning film, I found it to be almost void of emotions and musicality. The characters were uninteresting and lacked emotional depth. In other words, I didn't care about them. I was not sure about any of the characters' motivations. In the first film, all the characters shined with charismatic personalities. They were unique in their own way and I truly cared about them. They embodied everything that makes us human. This was a vital element that made the original so special. BR2 on the other hand has sad and forgettable characters. It is a very sad film whereas the original had moments of happiness to mix up feelings and lighten the mood, which made it more realistic.The music in BR 2049 was the biggest let down for me. It just didn't make sense because there was no music. A strange mix of very loud noises with faint echoes of original Vangelis tones interlaced (I listened to the entire score to be sure!). The musical score by Vangelis in the first film was one of the key elements that made the original my favorite film of all-time. I love atmospheric films that are visually & musically driven to tell the story. The music creates different feelings that make you fantasize. It makes you feel the movie and think about it long after it's over. The music in BR1 was incredible. It set the tone of the film perfectly. There was a haunting eerie atmosphere that along with the images created a hypnotic feel. Vangelis mostly used an electronic sound but he also incorporated piano & saxophone for melancholic effect. Not so in BR2. They messed up enormously this time. I know it's not possible to recreate Vangelis but they could have at least tried to create similarly-styled music by using the original score as a foundation. Even better, they could have perhaps made a completely original soundtrack all together. Blade Runner is an atmospheric film that is about feel and therefore must have a perfect music to visual ratio. Sure, they brought back one Vangelis theme for nostalgia but it wasn't enough.To conclude, I enjoyed the film but unfortunately cannot say I loved it. I simply cannot fathom the enormous praise given by critics & moviegoers. I don't think they understood what made the first film brilliant. BR 2049 does contain the main elements required for a true Sci-Fi film but fell flat at further exploring its themes. The original film on the other hand is a masterpiece. It felt spiritual & spellbinding whilst the sequel did not. Should you go see it? Yes. I would still recommend fans and anyone curious to go see this film in theaters despite its evident flaws. But as a huge fan it left me disappointed. Maybe I had high expectations! I gave it a generous 7/10"

","Pros: Beautiful to look at Beautiful women Cool technology Cons: SlowNothing is resolved Boring script, dialogue and lines Typical sequel (a shadow of its prequel) They really should become more judicious in picking which movies need a sequel and if they do that 90% of sequels will never come to be and the focus will shift towards developing new ideas."
24," So I went to the electronics store to buy a DVD player
","And the sales gal tried to sell me a DVD player with a fast forward button for $70. I said I don't need it. What else do you have that is cheaper? She really insisted I buy the expensive one with the fast forward button. I asked for something cheaper. She showed me another one with no fast forward button and it was $50. I took it!I regret it. She was right!!!Sitting through this long, dreary, illogical film made me to think of her. I should have bought the one with the fast forward functionality! The girlfriend was sweet to look at (I would lick her inner thighs any time) but this movie has as much reason for existence as McDonalds has vitamins."

28," People, stop watching sequels
","I could tell 15 minutes in that this film did not need to be made. It was boring. It was trying to justify its own existence. It was trying to figure out how to sell itself. It was trying to fit in elements from the original Blade Runner into its visuals to claim it has a relationship to the prequel.
I suggest people stop spending money on these films because Hollywood won't stop remaking and rebooting on its own."
29," High art? Hmm ...
","""Blade Runner 2049"" comes off incredibly long and boring. Not because of the slow pacing ‚Äì ""Blade Runner"" had slow pacing too, but had the viewer hypnotized ‚Äì but because there's no interesting thoughts present and nothing new really. Thematically the movie is exploring the same questions (about being human etc.) as the first movie did 35 years ago. And the few 'new' additions to the Blade Runner universe are totally devoid of originality. Take for instance K's hologram-wife. Not only are those scenes totally unnecessary (that three-way scene, jeez!), but we've seen the concept so many times before (for instance in Spike Jonze's ""Her""). Apart from that, the movie is riddled with plot holes and stuff that just don't make very much sense. Tyrell get's killed off by a replicant and his Nexus-7 prototype runs off, shortly after Tyrell Corp rushes a line of replicants with OPEN ENDED lifespans and no other safety device than implanted memories (that didn't work with Rachael). No. Just no. Furthermore we are told the nexus 9 are programmed to obey. However K lies to his superiors, constantly acts on his own, acts emotionally from early on in the movie. He does not obey at all. And the revelation of a replicant child being born has people talking about revolution. Robin Wrights Joshi says it will 'break the world'. But how? Rachael was the only replicant able to give birth and Tyrell took that secret with him. Neither the few remaining Nexus 8's or the 9's can give birth ‚Äì so no, it doesn't break the world. It doesn't break anything. But the movie really wants us to take this very seriously (Hans Zimmer is doing his loudest to make us sit in awe). And it gets even worse. Later we learn that Jared Leto's ridiculous bad guy Wallace (those monologues!) strives to learn the secret of making replicant babies. But why? That undermines the entire idea of replicants. Tailormade slaves with superhuman ability; strength, intelligence etc. that are controlled by implanted memories. Having replicants make babies the old way would offer zero control of the outcome and the child replicants would have to grow up, go to school, make their own memories. What's the point then? And what's the difference, from just having some people make babies? A lot of people has called ""Blade Runner 2049"" 'intellectual sci-fi' and so forth, but I found it to be quite the contrary. The movie forcefully demands you to accept it as highly intelligent art, but if you scratch the surface, you'll find something very different."
30," Please Do Not
","I read that Ridley Scott likes to produce more of these. Please do not!
Terrible!It was so boring. I cannot believe they thought anyone would get through this overlong movie in a dark environment like a cinema. Perhaps that is why they had the 'soundtrack' which was mostly explosive rip, tears and screeches instead of music to wake us up.I did enjoy the dog, the pretty girlfriend and the prostitute."

32," Seuqltitis
","As a big Blade Runner fan who loves to watch it over and over I was already on guard when they brought in the gang for a sequel. So many of the characters are either annoying or just dull and vapid. In other words, they are al phoning it in and inside know this is an embarrassment. This signifies the decline of humanity. The concept is the weakest in its illogic. I find myself getting annoyed to the point where I am starting to dislike the original if you can believe that.Hey Hollywood accountant-directors, not every movie needs to be re-made, needs a sequel or needs a prequel."
33," Best thing about this movie are the top keywords on IMDB
","The worst thing is its length and slow pace. How long do they think we can tolerate a dystopian future where you have a job, an apartment, cool gear and a super slender girlfriend that cooks for you and sets you up for a threesome???
Yup stupid film. It's a sequel."
34," Everything. Happens. In. Half. A. Speed.
","SPOILERS ALERT: The biggest difference between 1982 masterpiece and this one is that in the first film everything is happening at a normal speed. In original movie people talk like they talk in real life, their move at perfectly normal, every day, common speed, it doesn't take them forever to finish the sentence, or to shape out a thought, and yet... somehow it all works perfectly together.There's no way to know how will people (let alone robots) act or talk in thirty plus years, but if it is to be anything like in BR2049, I suspect it will be a pretty bleak and exhausting world.From the moment one, everybody talks, walks, plays, runs in some super-strange slow-mo: I'd say at 50% of the normal speed. It takes 10 seconds for poor Ryan Gosling only to take out something from his pocket. Not to say how long it takes him to walk through the scene - so much that half way through, let's say, the orphanage part, I have already forgotten what is he doing there in the first place.20 minutes into the movie, all I'm doing is wondering when this shot is going to end, when this scene is going to end, when the sequence will, and, ultimately, when the movie is going to end. This is not the way to pay a homage, to anybody or anything.There is a reason why the shots in ""2001 Odyssey..."" are that long, somebody should've warned the director about that. And there's also a reason why all shots in the original BR are that tight. And that's just one of the reasons to why both 2001 and BR are masterpieces. And for that same reason, BR2049 could that never be.You don't drag out every single aspect of the movie just to make it seem serious or pretend to be an artist, no. If you do, you get very expensive, anemic boredom. I have no idea why the director did it - he hasn't done it in that fairly fair movie with Hugh Jackman. What possessed him to do it here? Was it the importance of the first movie? Was it his fear to look like a schoolboy in front of the Master? Don't know, don't care.What a waste of great actors, class all - forcing them to engage in some sort of quasi elevated, quasi profound, but genuinely bizarre ballet that has nothing, nothing, nothing to do with the real life. The movie is three hours plus long only for the given reason - it would have been an hour shorter if had played out at normal pace.Oh - and to end here - the biggest dread of all: a hint of a possible franchise. Please, please, please people, for the love of all that's holly. Don't."
35," A visual masterpiece
","Let me start by saying that I am a huge Denis Villeneuve fan and absolutely love every movie he made, from his breakthrough drama 'Incendies' to the action thriller 'Sicario'. But when I learned that he was going to make a sequel to Ridley Scott's iconic Blade Runner I had mixed feelings. Would he be able to live up to the expectations and make a sequel that could measure itself with the original? For this reason, I went into the cinema thinking ''This will be a great movie, I am a Villeneuve fan so I have to like it'' but that was a mistake, for once I stopped expecting and just started experiencing the film, I was enchanted by all of its visual beauty. I was wrong to doubt Villeneuve; his 'Blade Runner 2049' even succeeds in transcending in some ways the original masterpiece, especially as a visual experience. The bleak dystopian future Scott so perfectly created is even more beautiful in Villeneuve's 2049, for which a lot of credit has to be given to the brilliant director of photography Roger Deakins, who has made one of his best works (which says a lot). Every shot is brilliant, I loved every single frame and I cannot imagine that he wouldn't get nominated and win an Oscar for this phenomenal work. But also a big thumbs up has to be given to the entire effects team, for Deakins didn't do it all on his own. Deakins isn't the only mastermind at work, for the score is also beautifully done. When I learned that composer J√≥hann J√≥hannsson (someone who has collaborated multiple times with Villeneuve and did most of the scores for his movies) got fired I was surprised; J√≥hannsson has always delivered great work, but according to Villeneuve, his score ''wasn't the right one'' for this movie for it didn't ''resemble Vangelis soundtrack for Blade Runner'' quite enough. So he got replaced by probably the best man in the business nowadays; Hans Zimmer. And as we are used to with the German composer, this was once again sublime and a great homage to the original. Zimmer's 2049 score can be compared to his Dunkirk score, in a way that it unsettles us from the first chord and just as the Second World War movie, it keeps us on the edges of ours seats, especially during the last hour.As for the people who are actually situated in front of the camera, they all play their parts very well. I was especially happy that Ryan Gosling's agent K was indeed the leading man and he did a very good job. I was slightly concerned that it would mostly be about Harrison Ford's Deckard, but luckily that wasn't the case. Nevertheless, Ford gives one of his best performances in years and after all the iconic roles he played once again in recent years (Han Solo, Indiana Jones) this is by far the best. The smaller but important roles are also noteworthy; Robin Wright's Lieutenant Joshi makes a fierce and convincing police chief, while the villain duo Jared Leto's Neander Wallace as the evil head of a corporation at the top of the new world order and his frightening hit-woman Luv (Sylvia Hoeks) are also very impressive. Last but not least, Ana de Armas is also very good as Joi, K's girlfriend (even if she does remind me a lot of Scarlet Johansson in 'Her' and slightly of Alicia Vikander in 'Ex Machina', but maybe that's something Villeneuve did that on purpose and wanted to pay homage to these recent but also very good science-fiction movies).That said, Villeneuve will receive most of the credit, as he should. For unlike most of Hollywood's blockbusters nowadays, he doesn't simply deliver us a spectacle with some nice effects or a reboot of the original, but he picks up the threads where Scott left, which was a monumental task, for the original 'Blade Runner' is one of the most impressive and iconic movies ever made. 2049 continues on the same topics raised by the original, making the sequel worth the 35-year long wait; it goes further with what was proposed in the first installment, enriching one another. It is possible that one day a third installment could be made, but that is only if any director will ever find the courage to make another 'Blade Runner', for the bar is raised incredibly high. I believe that in time, 'Blade Runner 2049' will just as the original one, grow into a cult movie, and rightfully so, for it is its own movie, but, just as the original, a visually remarkable, achingly human sci-fi masterpiece. I am not going to say more about it, because the studio has been unusually insistent in its pleas to critics and the first movie viewers not to reveal any plot points, but I am glad they did. Even if I could go on and on about the movie and the difference between replicants and humans (or is there really much of a difference, after all?) the less you know the better, because 2049 feels at its best when it surprises (which is one of Villeneuve's greatest strengths). This is a movie best experienced on the biggest screen in your cinema; trust me, it will be worth your while. As for me, I will most likely try and make some free time in my schedule for the coming days, 'cause I want to go the cinema again, guess what I'm gonna watch..."
36," Sinful
","There would be something... as it stands there is nothing in this film other than sinful ungodly sex. I wasted my time. I am definitely not interested in watching the original.Evil. ZzzzzzzzzzzzzzHollywood, you have no original ideas = go home."
37," Jaw dropping and richly rewarding...well worth running with
","'Blade Runner' is a masterpiece and a favourite of mine. It is still to this day a genre and film landmark, and ties with 'Alien' as Ridley Scott's best film, despite being disliked at the time it has rightly gained its reputation as a classic.Hearing that there was a sequel over thirty years later left me with intrigue, with a great cast (Ryan Gosling and Harrison Ford), one of the best cinematographers in the film industry today in Roger Deakins and with an equally great director on board (having liked to loved Denis Villeneuve's previous films), but also nervousness considering (with notable exceptions) the general reputation with sequels. 'Blade Runner 2049' turned out to be well worth the wait, it is easy to see why it will alienate some with its very long length (can understand the overlong criticism) and slow pace but it is even easier to understand the acclaim the film has received.Is 'Blade Runner 2049' better than 'Blade Runner' or on the same level? No. Is it nearly, or shall we say just, as good? Yes. To me it is one of Villeneuve's better films along with 'Sicario' and 'Incendies' (my least favourite of his is 'Arrival' and despite being an understandably divisive effort to me it was still good) and one of the exceptions to the general reputation of sequels. A sequel that treats its predecessor with respect (including some thoughtful and cleverly done nods to it, including quotations from the original score, even Ryan Gosling's name is a nod to the original author Phillip K Dick) and also its audience with respect. Despite its faults, it's also one of my favourite films of the year, and this year has been very hit and miss for films so this is saying quite a bit.Sure 'Blade Runner 2049' is not without its flaws. Can totally see where people are coming from criticising the length, most of the time it was not a problem but some of the time there was a sense that the length was too inflated, 20 minutes could have trimmed with no problem at all. There are a few implausibilities and contrivances here and there towards the end and much more could have been done with the underdeveloped character of Jared Leto (the only weak link in the cast, he doesn't have the presence to pull the role off and doesn't look comfortable or interested).However, 'Blade Runner 2049' does a huge amount right. It looks amazing, it's impeccably and imaginatively designed with some of the best special effects seen in a long time. It's Deakins' cinematography that particularly stands out, darkly gritty, gorgeously fluid and beautifully audacious Deakins shows that he is fully deserving of being considered one of today's best cinematographers. One cannot praise 'Blade Runner 2049' without mentioning some of the best directing Villeneuve has ever done in a contender for the best directed film of the year (well between him and Nolan for 'Dunkirk'), he is absolutely the right man for the job and shows himself to be not only completely at ease with the material but also tailor made for it. Once again there is a beautiful darkness but also a hard edge and sense of wondrous awe.Another big standout is the synthetic music score by Benjamin Wallfisch and Hans Zimmer, so well done and fitting that one doesn't miss Johann Johannsson that desperately. Though imagine what the film would have been like with his involvement, from my understanding he was originally meant to do the music but was fired for reasons that are a mystery to me and Wallfisch and Zimmer were parachuted in and did marvellously with big shoes to fill. It's appropriately hauntingly discordant, heart-pounding and tension-filled, with seeming echoes and quotes to the original's score. The sound effects are clever and thrillingly authentic, like for example the replicated wolfhound.When it comes to the writing and story, 'Blade Runner 2049' also triumphs, even if the story is not perfectly executed. The action-oriented scenes and conflicts are filled with tension and suspense as well as ingeniously choreographed, a fine example being the masterful prologue which has to be one of my favourite opening sequences of 2017. The science fiction elements are positively awe-inspiring, often making my jaw drop, while the philosophical ones are incredibly thought-provoking and never heavy-handed (many films have made a hash with this aspect, it was refreshing to see a film doing it well). Despite being a long and slow film, a vast majority of the film was richly rewarding, with a delicious quiet tension and absorbing mysterious elements.Excepting Leto, the acting is great. Best of all being Harrison Ford as a suitably world-weary Indiana Jones-like Deckard, that and the 'Apocalypse Now'-like meeting with Ryan Gosling providing a nostalgic element, and a deliciously cold-hearted Sylvia Hoeks (her character and performance being what Leto's character and performance should have been). Ryan Gosling also plays it straight to great effect.All in all, despite imperfections this jaw-dropping, richly rewarding, very respectful and visually stunning follow-up is just as good, if not quite as, as the 1982 masterpiece and one of my favourites of the year. 8.5/10 Bethany Cox"

40," A masterpiece of science fiction and possibly one of the greatest sequels ever made
","Blade Runner 2049 is the sequel to the 1982 sci-fi classic Blade Runner. Directed by Denis Villeneuve (Arrival, Sicario) and once again based on Philip K. Dick's novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, it successfully recaptures just about everything excellent about the original and is a superb sequel to one of the greatest and most important science fiction films of all time.Thirty years after the events of the first film, LAPD Officer K (Ryan Gosling) works as a Blade Runner, retiring old rogue replicants (artificial humans) hiding out around the Los Angeles area. One day while on a job, K discovers a long buried secret in the yard of a replicant which leads him on a journey to track down former Blade Runner Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford), who has been missing for decades.Featuring amazing visuals and some of the most philosophical and thought-provoking themes since the original, Blade Runner 2049 is a masterpiece of science fiction and is possibly one of the greatest sequels ever made. I was transfixed the entire time, to the point where I felt that even blinking would cause me to miss something I wanted to see. The cast was brilliant as well, especially Ryan Gosling, who does a fantastic job carrying the film as its lead actor. However, perhaps best of all, is that seeing the original is not a requirement to fully understand everything that is going on, although it would probably still help to have done so beforehand. I'm almost certain that author Philip K. Dick would be proud of this film. I know I am.I rate it a very high 9.5/10"
41," A refreshing sequel that is more art than commercial
","So on first viewing I am delighted to say that this is a true sequel to the original yet able to stand alone. Unlike other franchise reboots this chooses to pay homage to the original and thankfully avoids the temptation of being unabashedly commercial. I am a big fan of the original. I might even give BR2049 a 10 on later viewings. It wasn't what I was expecting so I can say a big thumbs up to those critics (and YouTubers) who agreed not to publish any spoilers. I found myself admiring the blade runner 2049 visuals without finding them distracting or in any way self-serving. Bravo to both Denis and Roger for pulling that off. I have to say that this is a true Sci-fi movie, a movie that will satisfy die hard fans of Sci-fi books. Hampton Fancher has done a truly awesome job of creating story and a script which would stand up well next to the bibliography of Philip K Dick. At no stage did this movie feel like an imitation of the first. The cast is a great fit, the score is sublime, the pacing it similar but different, the cinematography outstanding, the story and script original, the whole feel seems just right. Am I alone in this appreciation? Probably not. Half the audience will have never have seen the original in the cinema and yet we all clapped in unison, old and young when the credits began to run. Thank you to all those involved in this project."
42," Completely over-hyped and undeserving of the praise
","I never was one of those people asking for a Blade Runner sequel. Now that Blade Runner 2049 is out, my position still stands. This film is simply a massive letdown and nothing more.The year is 2049 and the world has grown in technology, but not humanity. Ryan Gosling plays K, a Blade Runner (a futuristic cop) tasked with tracking down the last of the Replicants-androids that look like humans. Knowing that he himself is a replicant, he goes on a journey of his own when he finds a box containing the bones of a Replicant who gave birth to a child and is tasked with finding the child. Little does he know that the new head of the Tyrell Corporation that makes the Replicants, Mr. Wallace (Jared Leto), plans to use the missing child for his own purposes and kill K if he has to.My main problem with the film is that it was unforgivably boring. The film is two hours and forty-five minutes long, which is already enough to test one's patience (and bladder), but it feels so deliberately paced; the characters almost always move so slow, that it feels like the filmmakers thought that it was the best way to pad out the running time, despite having not enough material to justify it.The performances range from great to laughable. Harrison Ford is hardly in the movie, and his inclusion is clearly a marketing ploy, but he gives the best performance in his brief running time and he feels like a continuation of his character from the original, Deckard, in a world where things have just gotten worse. Gosling isn't bad as K, and his stone-face actually is pretty effective in a couple of scenes, but Rutger Hauer in the original gave his Replicant character more of a personality. Leto is trying and failing to bring a degree of menace as the villain, and his female Replicant sidekick competes with him in the field of phoning it in.What else shocked me was how unsubtle the film was. The original was not only a futuristic crime noir that had Harrison Ford's Deckard chasing down androids, but also a personal journey involving himself and Rutger Hauer as the villain that involved trying to find a degree of humanity in such a futuristic world, and that maybe, Deckard is a replicant himself. Here, the story is mainly of Gosling trying to come to terms with the fact that he is a Replicant and what it means in terms of his humanity. Whereas in the original, there were subtle signs, images, and bits of dialogue that hinted at Deckard's purpose in the original, everything is spelled out for the audience to the point that old bits of dialogue are repeated thrice at important moments. It doesn't respect the audience's intelligence at all. The first and final thirds of the film are mainly filled with dialogue that is basically speeches that preach ideas about conflict and the ethics of machines, but hardly any of it is explored in an interesting fashion. What's worse, the film feels so empty and devoid that for a time, I forgot what K's objective was.What I will say is that the cinematography is beautiful. There are a lot of colorful images with ancient ruins and futuristic tech in the background and foreground that could easily pass as being part of an art gallery. The only downside is that there is too much gray in some shots and it feels too clean compared to the original.Why Warner Brothers and Sony wasted their time making this film, I have no clue. Maybe it was Ridley Scott's fault. After being unimpressed with his Alien: Covenant earlier this year (and was also quite the snooze-fest), watching this only proved to me further that Scott just doesn't care about good filmmaking anymore. Denis Villeneuve is clearly an ambitious director, but his style didn't feel completely right for this film. Clearly, in a film that tries so desperately to say much more humanity than its predecessor, it comes out feeling empty and feels less human than the original did.P.S. A lot of people have accused me of being too shallow and wanting this film to be more action packed. I do not have that mindset. I enjoy films that take their time as much as the next film enthusiast, but this one just didn't do enough to justify what it was aiming for. I'm not ashamed in expressing my opinion. Just let me be clear on something: going at a slow, deliberate pace and speaking lines of preachy dialogue does not, I repeat, does not equal intelligence. The positive reviews baffle me, especially on Rotten Tomatoes. Sony owns the company, which leads me to think that maybe it bribed more than a few critics in the hopes that more people would see it. Clearly, that is backfiring and I'm happy that people are rejecting it."
43," Paradox
","First they make a film to put us to sleep. It is boring, slow, tedious and quite sleep-inducing. We fall asleep and catch up on some much needed rest.Then the 'music' is a series of farts and tears and explosions and keeps waking me up. Look either get a soundtrack with music or skip it. What is with all the hi tech special effects' sounds instead of music???"
44," Plot holes so big, they're practically chasms
","Please be aware that my review contains spoilers so please do not read further if you do want to have key plot points revealed.First things first, I'm a big fan of the original and have enjoyed immensely with each viewing, first from when I was a 10 year old until 2 weeks ago so I was interested to see what Villeneuve would do with the sequel.Watched it Saturday and must say the experience left me somewhat underwhelmed and frustrated at seeing such an opportunity to do something original go to waste, that I have decided to post my thoughts here on IMDb for the first time.In no particular here are some of my questions and general points about the film.Jared Leto's performance. How the hell is he such a high paid star? I cannot think of anything he is particularly memorable and this is no exception.His eyes. Are they distracting on purpose?If his character saved the world from starvation, how come there aren't millions of people worshiping him? Humans are suckers for finding idols and why should his character be any different. Crikey, we have dictators in our world who had days and months of the year named after family members. Why doesn't Wallace have a massive army organised to hunt down Deckard instead of entrusting this to one replicant and a few goons?Monologues giving exposition is lazy storytelling and old Wallace loves a monologue.What is his plan? He wants to produce more replicants but kills one at the start for some spurious reason. Hint hint, to show the audience he is a very naughty boy. He also has the Rachel replicant killed. No wonder he cannot make enough replicants if he keeps killing them.Ryan Gosling plays Ryan Gosling again and although I don't dislike his performances, I find it hard to root for his character here, as I've seen it before in a much better film (Drive).The music wasn't particularly memorable and only made me think of the much better soundtrack from Bladerunner. Apparently this was intentional on Villeneuve's part as he removed the original composer who wanted to do something original. So instead, the director opted for Zimmer to make it more Bladerunnery and therefore less memorable for this film. The film did not merit or need the run-time it had. I appreciate the original BR took its time but it had a new world to show usThe ending was goofy and ridiculous. Why would K bring Deckard to his daughter who is the most wanted person in the history of wanted people? This will definitely endanger her given that Leto's character has a relationship with her and probably has her under some sort of surveillance. Hero comes back from the dead to save the day clich√© at end was extremely predictable and had me rolling my eyes, which I shouldn't be doing when watching a film for the first time.The blackout sounds like a much more interesting story than this. Caused by replicants? A solar flare? Was there a Trump two term presidency in this universe?Robots reproducing and creating their own has already been covered in Battlestar Galactica, who did it in a more compelling fashion with characters and stakes I cared aboutPlus, how come Leto's character hasn't figured out on to get replicants to reproduce? Why can't he produce them faster? How many has he killed before delivering a monologueSome of the visuals are stunning though lack depth or colour. The future looks fairly boring in comparison to Bladerunner 1982, which offered some very unusual street shots and characters. One scene included a guy with a eagle on his head. Nothing to really catch the eye in BR2049. Why not have Rachel as leader of the rebellion instead of some random person the audience has no connection with. When the capture Deckard, why on earth wouldn't they kill K? How did K know how to find the car with Dekkard at the end? We don't see him doing any investigative work to discover this information, despite the long run time.They made a replicant clone of Rachel but get the eye colour wrong? Seriously?How heavy handed was the prejudice? No subtlety whatsoever. Jeepers, you spend all that money on effects but then go minimum wage on screen writers. That sex scene reminded me of Ghost with all the syncing going on. Watching Whoopi do her thing was just as sexy as watching this scene, despite it having two incredibly attractive women present, along with Ryan Gosling who is no slouch himself in the looks department.The replicant rebellion feels shoehorned in rather than something which has grown and developed organically. Need to take lessons from Star Wars on how to introduce a rebel alliance story.The golden rule of cinema is broken here when they show/play clips from a much better film.Critics are only offering gushing praise for a film with considerable flaws because they don't wish to get caught out like the critics of 82. Back then, the critics hated it because they couldn't see the hidden depth. This time they see depth that simply isn't there. Even one of the characters says something along these lines to another."
45," A Long Wait for Disappointment
","In 1982 I was deeply excited about the prospect of seeing ""Blade Runner,"" and can remember applying for a chance to see an advance showing in Sacramento. From the start it seemed obvious that it was a special film--clouded in controversy and mystery. Later I acquired my much-viewed VHS copy, with all the eye-gouging, nail-puncturing violence. Later still the Internet provided background information as, eventually, did articles plus a comprehensive book by Paul M. Sammon. In short, I am a fan, and was eagerly anticipating the sequel.So, it was with disappointment that I left an October 6, 2017 showing ""Blade Runner 2049."" Overly long, boring, poorly paced, and confusing were my initial impressions, though admittedly it was beautifully filmed (potential Oscar nomination in cinematography?).I appreciated the many (too many?) subtle and not-so-subtle nods to the original film, the effort to build on the ""Blade Runner"" universe, and efforts by writers, directors, and actors to bring the story to life. But there were just too many scenes that should have been reduced in length from 25-50% of their run time. Such excess in a film is, to me, almost always a fatal flaw. And some scenes (e.g., where characters ""Joi"" and ""Mariette"" merge to make love to ""K"") could have been cut altogether, I feel, without harming the story.The acting was satisfactory or better, for the most part, as one would expect from the level of supporting talent.* However, I have knowingly seen two pictures starring Ryan Gosling‚Äî2016's ""La La Land"" and now this‚Äîand in both he is bland and wooden. Despite the fact that ""2049's"" ""K"" is SUPPOSED to be a self-controlled, artificial humanoid, I wonder if it is just Gosling's natural on- (and off-) screen persona. And frankly, Harrison Ford's ""Deckard"" just did not work for me. Sacrilegious, I know; but true. I blame this on two factors.First, Ford appears (too) late in the movie, by which time I was already exhausted by tedium. Second, for a character without appearance-changing makeup, a dramatic accent, say, or pronounced behavioral distinctions, it is hard not to just see Harrison Ford. (Kind of like Robert Redford miscast in 1985's ""Out of Africa."") Oh, it's (old) Harrison Ford again. Sorry HF fans everywhere.And another thing; due to poor direction, they included ""Admiral William Adama"" (Edward James Olmos) from TV's ""Battlestar Galactica,"" and not ""Gaff"" (also Olmos), in a too brief cameo. (Listen to ""Gaff"" in the 1982 original. Totally different voicing.)Like most films, it suffered from its share of ""Oh, come on!"" moments. Why would 6-foot ""K"" allow 6-foot-6 Dave Bautista's imposing ""Sapper Morton"" to make the first move (and thus begin the accumulation of a ridiculous amount of damage, most of it unnecessary, sustained by ""K"" throughout the story)? Because that's what movie detectives do. I must say, ""K"" apparently likes to pass violently through solid walls (a nod to Rutger Hauer's ""Roy Batty"" head in the original, I take it).Almost all action-adventure films are silly in hindsight and full of movie plot clich√©s‚Äî""Blade Runner 20149"" is no exception. But the test of a good movie is whether the story flows at a pace that makes audiences subconsciously accept and even relish these otherwise nonsensical encumbrances (see 1999's ""The Matrix""). For my part I was less inclined to give ""2049"" a pass on the silliness due to its plodding nature.Ridley Scott is prominently associated with both the recent ""Alien"" and Blade Runner"" franchises, and has promised multiple sequels. Do we want this? Is state-of-the-art movie-making worth either ridiculously poor stories (the ""Alien"" franchise) or bad plotting and editing (""Blade Runner 2049"")? It's admittedly hard to make a good movie, but Scott and his people are paid a LOT of money to do so. Check Scott's IMDb filmography. Can any mortal be involved first-hand in that many projects? As with Stephen King, maybe it's time to pare down the quantity and re-focus on the quality? Just saying¬ÖIn conclusion, my disappointment focused primarily on the script and editing.**Some recommendations to potential viewers: First, if you plan to see ""Blade Runner 2049"" it will help to see one of 37 versions (e.g., voice-over or no voice-over?; graphic violence shots or not?) of the original 1982 film beforehand. Second, maybe wait to watch the movie digitally, so that you can re-play key scenes and increase volume on important dialogue. In the theater I kept mentally reaching for a non-existent remote control. Third, (after Recommendation One) if like me you hold the original picture in deep admiration as a flawed but intriguing analog masterpiece of SF movie-making, consider skipping this sequel altogether. But I imagine that warning will fall on deaf ears._____* Because of the look and feel of two female characters in the film, I wonder if actresses Felicity Jones (""Rogue One"") and Tatiana Maslany (""Orphan Black"") were originally considered for the parts eventually played by Ana de Armas (companion hologram ""Joi"") and Sylvia Hoeks (deadly replicant ""Luv""). While watching the trailer footage, I originally mistook those two characters for actresses Jones and Maslany. Their doppelgangers did just fine, though. Hoeks' ""Luv"" is particularly chilling.** Oh, and the music! Not so good. Too often I was aware of background music--that by itself is not a good thing--and its shortcomings. So much so that by the end of ""2049,"" where original ""Blade Runner"" music (""Tears in the Rain,"" I think) is (finally) used, it left me with mixed feelings. First, thank god! Second, where was that musical excellence during the rest of the film? Music can make or break a film, and is incredibly important. Few excellent films have poor musical soundtracks. Unfortunately, ""Blade Runner 2049"" is not an exception to that guideline."
46," Androids dream of wooden horses
","A question I've been asked, given that Blade Runner 2049 is being released thirty-five years after 1982's Blade Runner, is; do I need to have seen the first film? I believe it will make a lot more sense, indeed it may only make sense, if you have seen the first film. The next question is; which version of the first film? Yes, there are seven. For me, and for Ridley Scott, it's The Final Cut version. So before we talk about the new film, trust me, it's complicated. Other preparations you need to make before viewing Blade Runner 2049 are: get a good night's sleep beforehand, use the bathroom and bring a flask and sandwiches. This film is 163 minutes long.At the end of Blade Runner (depending on which version you watched), Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) rides off into the sunset with Rachel (Sean Young), a replicant he fell in love with after ""retiring"" Roy Batty and his mates. Director¬†Denis Villeneuve's Blade Runner 2049 introduces us to a new Blade Runner named ""K"" (the name given to police personnel who hunt down and ""retire"" replicants), played by Ryan Gosling. K is despatched to the desert to retire a replicant farmer (Dave Bautista). While there he discovers the buried remains of Rachel and a new mystery is born. Along the way he encounters other replicants and eventually, his investigation leads him to Las Vegas where Rick Deckard has been living out his life. Together they embark on solving the mystery.I'm being deliberately obtuse in my exposition because I don't want to give away the plot twists and turns and more importantly, the end.There is a great support cast including Robin Wright who plays K's police chief and Cuban native Ana de Armas¬†who plays K's holographic girlfriend in an emotive performance. Jared Leto turns up as Niander Wallace who has taken over replicant manufacture from the bankrupt Tyrell Corporation.Blade Runner 2049 carries on in the same style as the 1982 film. From the cityscapes to the future it projects, the new film creates a believable 2049, darker and more miserable than 2019 (the time period the 1982 film was set). The sprawling metropolis, the single-colour palettes in the desert, the lighting through water and the framing give a real sense of ¬†the dystopian future ahead. Kudos to cinematographer Roger Deakins. It also continues the central question of the 1982 film: what does it mean to be human? Are just the sum of our memories? Do humans have souls? There is a lot going on. To it's credit, Blade Runner 20149 does not pander to the audience. It assumes they are smart and can deal with these topics without being spoon fed. There is no long exposition to explain the plot. There are twists and turns and Villeneuve knows the audience are intelligent to keep up.Seeing Harrison Ford back in action is a joy. He throws himself back into the role he played 35 years ago with gusto and the film is better for it. He clearly has an affection for the character of Rick Deckard who is probably the most enigmatic character he has ever played. For his part, Ryan Gosling makes an excellent addition to the story line as the new Blade Runner. His expressionless face captures the lack of empathy with which he retires replicants. As the film progresses we see a tender side of him with his girlfriend and his struggling to make sense of dreams from his childhood. His closing scenes, with echoes of The Shining are touching.As a continuation to the 1982 film, Blade Runner 2049 takes the story forward in a thought-provoking fashion while leaving some of the unanswered questions from the 1982 film still unanswered. For example, there was great debate at the end of Blade Runner as to whether Deckard was a replicant himself. Don't be expecting this film to answer that. If you truly want the answer to that, you will need to read Philip K Dick's short story: Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? We know they dream of unicorns!An amazing 4.5 out of 5. This intoxicating film will need several viewings and each will be as brain-twisting and as welcome as the first. I look forward to the next instalment. Hopefully we won't have to wait 35 years!"
47," The most interesting part of the movie was...
","...the return of the giant Atari sign from the original Blade Runner.OK, quick story synopsis. Bones found of a Replicant who's given birth. How was it possible and where is the child (now adult)?I'm sorry, but having waited 35 years for this movie it just didn't press any buttons for me. It's an hour too long, the story-line is weak to non-existent and doesn't get answered, the theory of Deckard's origin is again teased at but not answered (even though there really is very little in the original to point to him being a repilicant).This is another SFX over substance movie. Looks good, although very dark in the 3D version, but there just doesn't seem to be the energy and edginess of the original. It all seems too NICE. Having seen the original movie over 30 times, I'm not sure I'll bother returning to this new story. I have to agree with Rutger Hauer about trying to add to a perfect movie."
48," this movie should never have been made
","The first movie (which should have stayed the only movie) is a masterpiece of sci fi. I was hooked from the start great story and for the time great FX also cannot beat the soundtrack by Vangelis.Not sure what is going on with Ridley Scott first with is Alien Convenant he destroyed the series there and now with the new addition of blade runner.I feel that all the positive reviews for this movie are fake, because the movie is a sad excuse to make money and makes no sense at all, no surprised it failed this weekend at the box office.The acting is good so are the special effects, but the story is weak and none existent, Tyrell corporation is gone and there is a new company that makes the replicans, and tyrell had found a way for them to reproduce and have babies.This is where the story gets weird, Deckard is brought back into the mix because he had a child with Rachel.The movie also lack action and in the end does not explain anything. I felt like a huge waste of 2h and a half.35y in the making for this wow just wow."
49," A soulless, bland copy of the masterpiece that was the original
","Blade Runner is one of my favorite films of all time for a number of reasons: 1) Amazing groundbreaking trailblazing visuals that spawned an entire genre (aka ""cyberpunk""). 2) Superb music by Vangelis that is integral to the film. 3) Great characters and amazing acting. 4) Underlying philosophical themes of corporate oppression (Blade Runner is just a small cog in a huge machine just carrying on with his life doing the job because otherwise he's reduced to nothing), existentialism (what it means to be human) coupled with Biblical references presented in a subtle way. 5) Amazing practical special effects that make the world around the characters feel lived-in. 6) Meticulous attention to detail, lighting in particular. While ""2049"" is nothing more than a mere attempt at recreating something in the style of the original by a studio committee ticking off the items in the checklist. The result is abysmal because it does not introduce something new in terms of visual design, interesting characters, music or story. On the contrary it tries so hard to tie itself to the original it's sickening. Call it fan-service or pandering, either way it leads to the movie being a highly derivative product that exists solely because of the original.1) Plot lines that go against the premise of the original (Nexus 6 being able to reproduce, new Nexus 8 being easily distinguishable from humans) are stupid. 2) Acting is horrendous. Ana ""Pouty lips"" De Armas couldn't hold a candle to Sean Young not to mention the pretentious for pretentiousness sake Jared Leto. Ford is here for a paycheck and Gosling is deliberately one-note. 3) The music is a lame attempt at copying Vangelis' beautiful score.4) Too varying visuals leave you with this feeling of an inconsistent world that doesn't follow the idea of polluted lifeless post-industrial world where the sun doesn't shine, it's constantly raining and the only light outside the building is that of the advertising that seems more real than anything else. 5) Running time. The original was purposefully slow while the overblown running time of the sequel comes off as director loving certain sets and trying to savor them far longer than he should've. 6) A myriad of logical mistakes and plot holes (kids with a 100% matching DNA are of different gender).7) The opening shot with the closeup of an eye is almost beat for beat with the original. 8) The zooming sequence is hammered home by the sheer repetition. 9) The characters are bland, unoriginal and politically correct female copies of the originals, namely Madam and Luv. 10) The opening sequence is the unused part of the Fancher's script (watch Dangerous Days documentary). Overall it seems that producers/writers have an erroneous idea of made the original film great. As if stuffing Biblical references into Neon- lit set pieces, inhabited by some pale copies of original characters and extending the awkward silences would amount to a great movie. To sum up ""Blade Runner 2049"" does not reinvent the wheel, does not offer anything one-of-a-kind or even slightly memorable. There is no reason (other than cash flow for the studio execs) for it to exist. Save the cash and rewatch the original that actually challenges your intelligence and leaves you with a lot to think about."
50," Oh dear...
","What a disappointment, so much hype and, therefore, expectation but this is no more than a competent sci-fi film, certainly not a worthy successor to the original. I could support a 163 minute run time if there was plenty of content but at times it felt like the actors were moving and speaking slowly not for effect, but to fill in the gaps. As for the plot, everything revolved around the ability or otherwise of replicants to breed. If you have the technology to grow a human body from scratch and implant whatever memories you want I'd have thought introducing the mechanics of reproduction wouldn't be difficult. I could go on but really, this film isn't worth the bother."
51," Visually striking existential science fiction mystery
","Warner Brothers, Alcon Entertainment, Columbia Pictures, and director Denis Villeneuve team up to make this one. . It's 30 years after the events of the first film, as we follow ""K"" (Ryan Gosling) a ""blade runner"" for the LAPD. Blade runners are tasked with tracking down and ""retiring"" (killing) renegade replicants (artificially created humans with enhanced strength). The biggest change is that K himself is a replicant, one of a new type designed by brilliant recluse and ultra-powerful tycoon Wallace (Jared Leto). During his latest assignment, K stumbles upon a mystery that may change the lives of humanity and all replicants, alike.Harrison Ford was featured prominently in all of the advertising for this, for good reason, but his role is very minor, almost an extended cameo, and not even appearing onscreen until 105 minutes in. Gosling is most definitely the lead, thankfully in my opinion, as I'd rather they go at the material from a different angle than simply attempting a rehash with fancier special effects. After watching the film, I'm not surprised that it flopped. It's long (over 2 and a half hours), it's slow by Hollywood movie standards, it's frequently quiet, and it's very deliberate, introspective, philosophical on an existential level, and filled with dozens of small details in the periphery of the screen that allude more than explain. I'm happy to see that the writers decided to make this a future carried over from the first film, rather than making it a future to our present time. That may sound confusing, but what I mean is that there are visual references to a still-existing Soviet regime, and there is little of the mobile device fascination endemic to most modern sci-fi. The character played by Ana de Armas, a sort of ""virtual girlfriend"" comprised of a hologram projector and an AI, is the closest to that, but it's well handled, and helps deliver a good emotional punch or two late in the game.I was impressed with Sylvia Hoeks, an actress I'm unfamiliar with, as the film's main ""bad guy"", a severe replicant corporate type with a violent streak. Small turns by Dave Bautista and Carka Juri are also good, and while I liked Jared Leto's interesting off kilter characterization, it seemed under-utilized. The only one who I had a problem with was Robin Wright, who I normally like, but here something was off. I blame some of her dialogue. The film looks fantastic, with numerous different visual palettes and textures. The only thing that keeps this from being a full-fledged masterpiece in my opinion is a lack of closure on a few story points that seem like they may have been intentionally left dangling for possible future sequels, the likelihood of which are very slim at this point."
52," Do tears freeze in the snow?
","BR2049 has more plot holes than emmental cheese and one big ""plot twist"" that I won't mention, not because it would spoil much, but because if you decide to watch this movie, you deserve to be disappointed by its stupidity.The big ""twist"" is mentioned as the ""miracle"", but it is absolutely idiotic and illogical from the point of view of a manufacturer of replicants. How did ""that"" might have ever be considered a good idea? One would assume that after the disaster of the Nexus 6 series, Tyrell Co. and his successors would have invented some more reliable security system - such as a lower level of self-consciousness, way safer than the questionable ""obedience"" of the Nexus 8. Or even something like all the androids looking the same, so that they can be easily detected and you would not need blade runners to locate and eliminate them.Anything that would provide humanity with useful, free labor without ethical problems¬Ö But no, in this movie ethical problems just got exponentially bigger. And so much for a science so advanced as to reproduce perfect bodies and minds...Besides, since it is established that humankind sucks, I failed to understand how replicants are in any way better, since they just want to be more ""like humans""¬Ö. On the visual side, BR2049 sucks, too. Looks like they used random leftovers scenery from other Sci-Fi/disaster movies, from the overused industrial background of Terminator to the desertic blurred landscape of MadMax and the inevitable nightmarish city-scape, which looks like Blade Runner, but on cheap side. Costumes looks like the contemporary drab clothing promoted by Nordic high street chains: lots of dark, cheap-looking leggings and stretchy tops, a far cry from the decadent, elaborate futuristic/retro suits of BR.In one scene, Deckard meets Tyrell's successor in a closed room filled with water, except a square island in the middle. A room that has no other reason to exist except bringing back memories of the ""original"" Tyrell building.The dialog is unbelievable bad and scenes drag on forever. When the Goslin character finds Deckart, the two spend over ten minutes fighting and chasing each other, when a couple of lines of dialogue would have avoided that. The ending is both manipulative and plagiarist: it wants to move the audience, recreating the amazing poetic moment of Roy Batty's death, but using snow instead of rain. If nothing else, the ending would have been enough to put me off this piece of commercial garbage."
53," Boring Runner
","I didn't realise 2049 also was the actual length of the film! It sure felt like it! 3 hours of boring dialogue, hollow characters and an embarrassingly weak story. Hard to believe Ridley Scott really made this!The first Blade Runner worked the pace of the film brilliantly up to the powerful ending. The story was a rather simple sci-fi noir detective story with a twist. It made some huge comments on humanity and what kind of future we want. It worked on so many levels. It could be viewed as a simple sci-fi detective story or as a great spiritual journey that asked all the big questions. ""And what can your maker do for you?"".The first Blade Runner had so many great lines but with 2049 I cannot remember a single quotable line. 2049 completely lacks all which made the original the best sci-fi movie ever. I take the same view as Rutger Hauer recently did. Why even try to do a second one? It would be as painting a second Mona Lisa. Or building another Eiffel tower.A huge disappointment of a sequel that should never have been made."
54," Dull without suspense
","The original Blade Runner is one of my favourite films so I was really looking forward to this one. What a disappointment. If I wasn't in the company of others I would of walked out early. I left the cinema feeling annoyed that I had to sit through this overlong monotonous film. The storyline is dragged out with the main character just going from place to place to investigate something like in a video game. At the beginning he is in a fight scene and you find out he is basically indestructible. The replicants are now terminators. This leaves out any suspense that he is in danger. The first film was kind of believable, the city was overcrowded and the building were decaying - it had atmosphere. This one looked like a more modern city with a lot of emptiness. The technology has advanced so much that he now has a solid light fully realistic AI holographic companion that operates from a small device he can keep in his pocket. If you think about it why are they so desperate to increase replicant slave labour production when they are capable of building AI robots that can be enveloped with holographic light to look human. They still have the blurry 1950 TV quality monitors to echo the first film but the supposed technology jump does not make sense. The music by Vangelis was one of the most important parts of the original. He conveyed through the use of synthesisers and traditional instruments a sense of awe and wonder, beauty and the sadness of a dystopian world. Johann Johannsson was originally commissioned to score the film and I think he would of done a great job but they decided for some reason it was not Hollywood sounding enough so they bought in Hans Zimmer. What a disaster. It might as well be the music from Batman VS Alien. Just lots of loud noise. The original was a box office failure that became a cult classic. This is just a failure."
55," Do machines have a Soul?
","Went to 1st screening on opening day, and three days later it is still hard to describe how amazed and blown-away this film left me... Blade Runner 2049 is simply, in one word: ""COOL!"" Many visuals were so richly constructed, and reminded me of the breathtaking visuals of films I've seen many times before (Kubrick's '2001', and Tarovsky's 'Stalker - two other favorite films). Not as imitation, but likewise, as almost a separate character of the story. You can't do this kind of story-telling, visually, in a 90-120 minute film. So, to me, the length of the film was about perfect! One thought in my head, just as in the original Blade Runner, was that machines (non-organic life-forms, like the Replicants) may indeed have a 'Soul' (if humans indeed have one?) The other thought I had was that every life, whether organic or synthetic, is so unique and precious. This was the message that I got from the action/plot/story...Thought that all the cast was wonderful. As Harrison Ford's character came in at the late minutes of the movie, I can say that as 'K', Ryan Gosling carried his part and the main plot of the film very well! Am so ready to see this in the theater at least 2 more times... and buying the Blu-ray (with many extras - one hopes!)Simply a worthy and beautifully crafted sequel to the original classic! And I say this as along time fan of Ridley Scott's 1982 film, and of the novel (Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep) it was based on, by that long gone genius writer, Philip K. Dick.... Just go and SEE THIS MOVIE - SEE IT TODAY!!!"
56," This was special
","It's amazing after repeated viewings the lack of patience or inability moviegoers have to simply follow a plot. The lack of concentration throughout the cinema, the talking throughout and some of the comments I have read is downright disturbing. This movie is high art and some people need it spoon-feed to them. If you're not invested from the get-go, just go home.Blade Runner 2049 is not your typical movie and it was never meant to be. There are no superheroes or giant robots. Explosions are scarce and it's not funny either. It's about emotion and memories and like the original Blade Runner (1982). It poses the same Philip K Dick inspired questions about humanity - what does it mean to be human and are we just the sum of our memories? It now raises questions about artificial intelligence and real love.It is a sequel 35 years in the making to one of the most thoughtful and provocative movies ever. The original movie was a box office flop which later developed a cult following and and has since been hailed a masterpiece. Ridley Scott created a multilayered world which seduces you into a nostalgic like trance for a place which never really existed and a sequel to a film held in such high regard is rarely ever a good idea but Blade Runner 2049 is a rare exception. Think The Godfather Part II, Aliens and Terminator 2: Judgment Day before it.No spoilers. We follow Officer K (Ryan Gosling), a new character and a new breed of Blade Runner on the trail of an old model replicant but what he uncovers along the way is so much bigger and threatens to shift the balance of what is left of humanity.Director Denis Villeneuve (Sicario, Arrival) and his crew have crafted a beautiful looking film which pays homage to the original without trying to copy it at all. The same rain-soaked, neon-lit streets are present in L.A, only the Eco-system is even more shattered. Sustenance is scarce with protein farming a way of life and while there are obvious nods to the first movie 2049 relishes the opportunity to avoid the familiar and takes us outside the city limits.The cast in 2049 is excellent. Ryan Gosling carries the main story with ease, playing his detective character with an ice-cold calm until...Harrison Ford as Rick Deckard, the original Blade Runner delivers a highly emotional and raw performance which I found very surprising. Not because Ford is not capable as an actor but Deckard was played so dryly in the original, especially next to Rutger Hauer's Roy Batty. Clearly time and circumstance have clearly changed him here and it's a refreshing approach.The casting choices of side characters in limited roles such as Dave Bautista, Robin Wright and Ana De Armas in her very unique role were fantastic. Jared Leto gets only a few scenes as villainous creeper Niander Wallace, the corporate tycoon with a god complex but his best 'angel', Luv (Sylvia Hoek) gets plenty and rightfully so because she's excellent.If I I had to choose any negatives from 2049 it would be need to spoon-feed the audience in scenes by adding a small flashback here and there which I thought was unnecessary. The score was clearly not Vangelis who did the first movie and made up so much of the nostalgic atmosphere in it. While good I did miss the sadness, the piano keys and blues of Vangelis for a time but could tell the score was aiming for something different, more urgent, a sense of dread which was probably more appropriate anyway with 2049 being much larger. That's not to say there aren't hints of Vangelis because there most definitely is.It has been 35 years and the need for a sequel can be debated forever. Was it necessary? No. But was it good. Yes, really good. Is it a masterpiece? I would say that it's an extremely satisfying conclusion to Deckard's story and having seen it it's made the original even better.A movie like this does not come around very often. The world needs more movies like Blade Runner, 12 Monkeys, Ex Machina... and Blade Runner 2049. High praise.Best movie of the year!"
57," Visually stunning and thought provoking, but not flawless
","So, I didn't expect much from this sequel when it was announced, but since the original 'Blade Runner' is, in my opinion, one of the greatest movies ever made (if not the greatest), I had to see it anyways. As I often do, I didn't read any reviews or watch any trailers before going.So, where do we start... While not perfect, and inferior to the original, this is still a great movie. Visually it's simply stunning and the actors are all excellent. Just as importantly, or maybe even more so, like the original it combines a slow pace and fantastic ambiance to create an introspective mood and invite reflection on some important themes and issues of our time. (although, maybe, lacking a dialogue with the same power as the Roy Batty monologue at the end of the first movie).As some negative reviewers said, it is slow..... but that works well with the story and its intent to create a very clear, pervasive mood rather than to dazzle with dumb car chases, gunfights, or explosions,not to mention pushing the viewer to form his own opinions. The boringpart is subjective: for viewers who like to be challenged intellectually I'd say many action movies are a lot more boring. Nothing wrong with escapist movies, which I also enjoy when I'm in the right mood, but it doesn't change the fact that they're inherently much more predictable, superficial and formulaic. In other words, entertaining but intellectually boring. Regarding Blade Runner 2049, one disappointment, though, to be honest, was the soundtrack: aside from being too loud, it really consists mostly of weird sounds/noises etc. While they do heighten the mood at times, or fit the atmosphere, they are not really not up to the lofty standards of the photography, the action, or the direction.Also, the plot could have been a little tighter, and while the slow pace is what this movie needed, I'm not convinced it really had to be this long (or to touch on so many themes, as it does). Still, it's a fantastic, and unique, viewing experience, and even with its imperfections it does create a believable (if gloomy and depressing) dystopian vision of the future, and touches on themes that could spark endless debate and reflection. And herein lies its beauty: shallow popcorn movies will have faded from everybody's memory in weeks. A movie like Blade Runner 2049 will inspire us and challenge us,whether we agree with some of its vision or not, maybe even whether we love it or hate it, for years to come."
58," Bold, patient, moody - a worthy sequel
","This is a great film, the visuals alone are incredible. But the thing that sets it apart is the same main quality that set Blade Runner (1982) apart - its unique mood. It's not uplifting but not depressing either. It cuts deeply, makes you feel something real. It isn't manipulating your emotions. It really captures that broken feeling of being a flawed human, looking for meaning in your life, lost in a dangerous world full of contradictions.The music is perfect for the movie. It's reminiscent of the Vangelis score for the original but doesn't just repeat it or rip it off. Its a continuation of the previous score, acknowledging it and moving on. A lot of it is loud rumbling or Inception-style BWAAARMS but it feels right. Then there are moments of near-silence. We hear things whirring past, slowly. As if some huge hovering spacecraft is visiting overhead. Is it part of the music or a physical sound the characters can hear? We can't tell, they blend together.There are interesting themes. It's a movie about cyborgs but delves into real questions about the nature of being human. How do we know if our memories are real? If there are gaps, does that mean that our memories are fake? Or do our emotions naturally cause gaps and inconsistencies anyway? If our memories have been implanted, then who are we really? Can our emotional reactions to fake memories be real and does that somehow validate them?Can you love a program? Can you bond with ""her"", become comfortable with each-other developing your own brand of playful banter, miss her when she's gone? Can love be reciprocated by a program? More importantly, does it even matter? Is loving someone really just a way to indirectly love ourselves?Will cyborgs ever be able to feel real emotions, reproduce, be whatever that combination of emotional/rational is that we call ""human""? Is human irrationality a strength or would cyborgs with absolute concentration be superior to humans in every way?The imagery is striking - like a collection of dystopian sci-fi paintings. A futuristic car, a man, a desolate landscape and a deadwood, for example. The film takes its time, letting the images wash over you. If you appreciate the style and the tone of the story appeals to you, you'll be in heaven. Others may start to get impatient. The movie isn't afraid to keep things hidden or vague from time to time, to allow rain to distort images, to dwell for a long time on a still frame before a character finally speaks. This movie exists outside the regular pace and tropes of what we've been trained to expect from typical movies. No one-liners, no obvious final looks or grimaces before cutting to the next scene. More like a loud, ominous build- up of music and then a bizarre panning shot into another scene - this movie has a vision.I saw Prisoners (2011) recently and was impressed by its patience, good acting and willingness to go into dark subject matter. I immediately wanted to know who the director was so I could see more - I could tell this wasn't a fluke, this was made by someone who knew what they were doing. There are too many pointless remakes, reboots, sequels and prequels these days. Numbers in titles become redundant, it's all about colons now. But when I found out Villeneuve was the director of Blade Runner 2049, I was suddenly very excited and this movie truly delivers. He's a serious contender for best current film-maker, second only to Nolan IMO.The acting is good. Ryan Gosling comes across as human but subdued. Not overly excited about the world he lives in or his job but with kindness in his eyes. We feel intimate with him but distant as well. He's doesn't really connect with his emotions. Maybe that's the point. We can sense they're there under the surface. It's certainly something I can relate to, feeling things but not always expressing it or understanding what they mean. Harrison Ford is given a dignified, meaningful role. He doesn't just have a cameo, nor is he merely lending his fame. This movie adds to Deckard's personal story and our fascination with it. Ana de Armas is equal parts sexy, playful, innocent and sensitive. I like when movies capture those universal, timeless, powerful moments in life - like looking into a beautiful girl's eyes the first time - it's a raw human experience and we are dwarfed by its power. In the movie, holographic attractive women the size of buildings tower over the people.Finally, the plot is intriguing if confusing at times. Its generally easy to follow but it can feel like some threads are missing at times. But the plot is secondary to the tone. I do like the mystery. We get to fill in many of the blanks for ourselves and its not too hard to do. It's more about understanding the characters, their motivations and how they're affected by the things they find out. Trying to piece the whole thing together seems unnecessary - there's no grand scheme, just individuals finding their way through the fog. Those expecting a completely coherent, dialogue-heavy movie will be disappointed.This must be a first. A sequel to a one-of-a-kind movie 35 years later which matches or even outdoes it. It respects the original but isn't bogged down in attempts to reference or imitate it. It continues the story in interesting ways. It captures something of that unique mood but in its own way. This is a movie that will age very well for a long time to come. Its contemplative, philosophical, ambiguous and enigmatic. It will only become more relevant as time goes on. But only time will tell quite how far ahead of its time it really is."

","i cannot believe these ten star comments, first the visuals were mostly flat, there was no explanation why in this time there were virtually no people around, one scene only with about thirty extras, no lights seems to be on either in the shots were he is flying over the city. more importantly you had a very thin plot that could have been told in less than an hour. nothing happens for most of the film. it is as if all concerned were on valium. the music was just noise. talk about an anti-climatic ending, the film just whimpers out. none of the very little plot made any sense. so here we have yet again critics raving about nothing. an insult to the original in every way. do not waste your time or money going to see this. i was going to list the many non-sensical things in the film but on reflection i don't think the film deserves anymore of my time"

One of my top 10 movies of all time. This review for 2049 is not because it should be the same thing or make it over the top.OK now this Blade Runner 2049. Bad boring. Where nothing really means much. Unlikable characters, music is ""meh"" nothing unique(A poor version of the original_. Bad people in this, who cares? Bring us back with someone who is actually a threat(like Roy). We have some stupid terminator woman who really just flat out sucks. Poor casting. Jared Leto sucks. Yeah, he really does. Then you have the black guy with a cane from walking dead, who talks to everyone sideways. Who talks to people sideways? Why did you cast him? I've never see someone in any other movie, show or real life talk to people when they are not looking at them. Fail!!! I thought it was stupid in walking dead and now its really stupid. Plot is blah. Oh, it's also like a journey for Ryan Gosling to go from one Cameo to another with another boring scene. Not much vocab, emotion. Even Roy in the original had TONS of emotion and even had poetry at the end when he decided to turn a corner and save life instead of destroying everything in his path.Harrison Ford is just an old man in this(sorry to say). Think it's time to retire. Did nothing in this film except hold a gun in Ryan's face and get captured with handcuffs.Do not believe the hype, not a good movie."

","Great for insomniacs otherwise.If you want to be bored to tears or have trouble sleeping, please watch this slow paced, unthrilling sequel."
62," This is how you make a worthy sequel: by expanding it in every direction
","Blade Runner has long been tough love for me. The first time I saw it I was almost bored to death by it, but since everybody kept saying what an absolute classic it was, I kept revisiting it. Somehow, there was this nagging feeling that I was missing out on something great. Of course I could see that it was superbly made on the art direction level, but I estimate that it took me about 5 or 6 times before I fully grasped the pure sci-fi themes at its core: what makes us human, and what excludes an artificial human from that qualification? Like all truly great art, Blade Runner has many layers and different qualities, and doesn't reveal its secrets all at once.It is not hard to imagine why Denis Villeneuve was daunted by the task to make a worthy successor to this cult movie. It is also easy to see that he succeeded incredibly well: Blade Runner 2049, like Aliens, Terminator 2 and Empire Strikes Back, is one of those rare movies that isn't just a great movie, it's also a great sequel. The best compliment I could give would be that it feels like a completely organic and logical follow-up to its predecessor, a natural second chapter, as if it were already conceived together with the original, rather than afterwards. Both Villeneuve and producer Ridley Scott said they were won over by a great script. Now this is something every filmmaker says before delivering a sub-par sequel (Wes Craven reportedly said the same about Scream 4), but in this case, it couldn't be more true.Good sequels use familiar parts, add some new, and in exceptional cases, they create something that casts a different light on its predecessor(s). Unlike The Force Awakens, Villeneuve doesn't rely on the classic elements from the very start (apart from he close-up of an eye). He opens with brightly lit shots from greenhouses on the countryside as opposed to a dark city skyline, and he even resists temptation to use the familiar sound from the flying Spinner cars. After re-introducing us to the harsh world of the future where humans have de-humanized and Replicants have no rights, he occasionally allows himself some familiar iconography, with sweeping shots of downtown LA, its seedy underbelly and the Tyrell pyramid; even Harrison Ford is sparingly used with maximum efficiency. The makers show remarkable restraint in a film that could have easily ended up becoming a quick re-hash; instead, it differentiates itself starkly by visiting the uncharted territories, both in its story and in the art-direction. The main plot deals with detective K trying to unearth a long-hidden secret, but again, those who read between the lines will see the implicit theme being explored here: is denying a race of Replicants their fundamental rights as beings on the grounds of the fact that they are manufactured instead of born not akin to slavery? Hampton Fancher and Michael Green did a superb job of including two survivors from the previous movie into the story, not as a fan service but as a logical extension of their journey. K (Ryan Gosling) becomes a reluctant player in the story, and part of his journey is finding out what exact role he plays in it. Another part is how K must find his place in a world where 'real' seems less clearly defined than ever. In his delightful scenes with Ana de Armas as his companion Joi, the human side of his stoic persona comes out, and it puts an interesting spin on the concept of 'what is real' when even Replicants seem to struggle with it. Some of the more touching scenes are pleasantly reminiscent of Spike Jonze's 'Her', and themes from Children Of Men, another superb movie inspired by Blade Runner's grim version of a dying future, are also quite overt. It is good to see that Blade Runner's spiritual successors have influenced its sequel in turn. Like true world-builders, Villeneuve and director of photography Roger Deakins show us the stark contrasts between the overpopulated city, the worn-out industrial outskirts and the almost surrealistic remains of Las Vegas. Combined with the slow-paced editing, this creates a sense of immersion that is rare in today's cinema. The sets and surroundings almost become like secondary characters in this set-up. Some might complain a bit about the excessive running time of over 2.5 hours, and in some scenes (especially the ones that focus on K's personal life), the tension sometimes trails off a bit too long at the expense of important subplots. But kudos for a director and a studio who dare to deliver a product much like its predecessor: an expansive, subtle, humane, cerebral, slow-burning blockbuster that feels no need to cater to audiences longing for lean, action-packed storytelling wrapped up in a neat climax. The satisfaction from 2049 not only comes from what it shows, but just as much from what it leaves out; not in the least in its beautifully subdued epilogue. 2049 is a work of art that may even surpass the original, although I say that with some reservation, recognizing the amazing groundwork that the first film laid down. It's just that 2049 feels more complete, whereas Blade Runner, despite its many versions, sometimes seems enigmatic in the sense that some crucial parts still feel missing. The ending of 2049 can work on its own, but it could also be an opportunity for a successor that elaborates on the parts that are now merely subplots. The disappointing box office may crush that hope in its early stages; again, it may show that the popularity of a movie reflects the passion of its fans, and not necessarily the size of its audience. The overseas markets may give the film the success it deserves, but even if this is the final word, this makes 2049 a more than worthy companion piece for the fans."

65," Art at its best
","It is obvious that you will see unexplained scenes and the magic of CGI in a science fiction. But what is not obvious is the slow and dramatic pace, the retro style, the psychedelic effect, the artistic set and a surreal vision, a classic and heart pumping background score, a sudden rise in adrenaline followed by a cold silence and last but not the least remarkable performances by every single character in the movie. But I think Ford (Deckard) was much more intense in delivering his emotions in 1982 Blade runner. However, it is Ryan Gosling's best performance till date after Notebook.Some people felt that the movie is bit slow and some scenes could have been edited to engage the viewers. But for me I think that's where it has succeeded. It is the realness of a moment which is more engaging than the breakneck stupid CGI scenes without any soul.The soundtrack was the backbone of 1982 blade runner and Vangeli used a variety of classical compositions from different culture and society. But Zimmer and Wallfisch has done it again and you will hear and see some classics by Frank Sinatra and Elvis Presely. This is also not something obvious in a sci-fi.Cinematography of this film is a visual treat. Any movie buff knows who Roger Deakins is and this time he has painted the sadness of this dystopian world with his artistic frames that it is so easy to lost in that world without 3d glass or VR gear. If you are a fan of Roy Betty and fan of art and fan of Dennis Villeneuve and his complex story telling, then go for it. But yes, this will haunt you and torture you and ask you several questions for which probably you do not have any answer today. It will surely trigger the philosophical quotient of your brain and you will start questioning the core purpose and value of being human. The last scene will remind you Roy Betty from 1982 Blade runner -""I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhauser Gate. All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain. Time to die."""
66," A Visually Striking Sequel that is Well Worth Your Time
","Visually the movie floored me. There's clearly so much intentionality and careful effort and planning that went into making that world. Villeneuve blended call backs to the original while still making this his own vision. I'll see anything he makes because I always feel like I'm in good hands with his movies, right from the opening scene.The music had a similar feel to the visuals in that they blended old and new. The iconic ""Tears in Rain"" melody receives a much-deserved return in a delightfully appropriate moment. I'll give the movie serious props for providing a comforting level of nostalgia without ever feeling that it pandered.Joi (Ana de Armas) and Luv (Sylvia Hoeks) were fantastic in their own very different ways. Joi, who plays Gosling's love interest of sorts, is essentially Samantha in Her, except she is a holographic projection instead of only a voice. Luv is Jared Leto's favorite replicant assistant and a total ice queen.Gosling was cool and dutiful, though kind of lifeless, which I guess was on purpose since he plays a replicant (or does he?) Juxtaposing him with Harrison Ford really made the subtleties of Ford's performance stand out in a way that was absent for Gosling. But Gosling was still very handsome and that worked well with the rest of the movie, which is striking and beautiful.Even though I didn't feel bored during any of the 164 minutes, I often felt like nothing was really happening. Even at the end I wondered what was the point. I know it was a character exploration of K (Gosling), like the first was of Deckard, and he clearly grew during the story. Still, the movie overall came across to me as heavy on striking visuals and light on substance.Perhaps I'm demanding too much. While I enjoyed the heck out of the movie and would watch it again in a second, it fell slightly short of the profound best picture level movie that I hoped it would be. Somewhere in the two hour and 44 minute runtime is a great two hour movie trying to emerge.All things considered, it's a pleasing complement to the original and is well worth a night in the theater."

","Plenty of raving reviews, but I do not agree with the masterpiece verdict by many reviewers. The original was complex, but yet simple to understand, and as the plot unfolds, the story engages you through the film.

Sitting through 150 minutes of drama, yet struggling to make sense of it, seems to me that the maker failed in the business of screen story telling. I was disappointed and found the first film so much better than this big budget fare. Dalton trumbo please help us as today's science fiction big budget films are in the main failing to be anything like as entertaining as they should be. Better script writers & screen story tellers are so important,yet it seems that simplicity is being substituted by muddled messy big budget effects, all for the sake of being so much cleverer than the dumb audience. Alfred Hitchcock knew how to make a film, a pity a few of these over hyped directors, don't have a rethink on what it takes to entertain an audience .

73," The Truth in the Rain
","To chase after an iconic masterpiece, to imitate or to try and supplant its rightful place, is a fool's errand.Thankfully director Denis Villeneuve along with his talented collaborators never succumbs to imitating or trying to super-cede Ridley Scott's 1982 landmark ""Blade Runner"". Hampton Fancher, who created the story of the original, has crafted a new screenplay with Michael Green, that not only builds on the themes of ""Blade Runner"", but ties them together with larger questions about the current human state and its challenges.Ryan Gosling stars as a replicant of the latest generation, who tries to solve a puzzle that leads him into the realm of real and manufactured life, and walks along the same noirish paths that made the original so gripping. Gosling imbues his character with a very compelling fa√ßade, which starts to crumble as his humanity takes over his mechanical design.The equally thrilling performances by Jared Leto, Ana De Armas, Robin Wright, Carla Juri and of course Mr. Harrison Ford, forge a credible bond with the audience and enhance the visual grandeur created by cinematographer Roger Deakins and production designer Dennis Gassner.And although ""Blade Runner 2049"" may not achieve the same level of force as its predecessor, it is a tremendously immersive, philosophical and touching experience, that should be enjoyed on the largest screen possible. The movie's pace is deliberately patient, which may confuse some members of the audience. But by slowing down and observing, the audience can revel in the immensity of the images.The more we move, inexorably it seems, towards the do-or-die reality of ""Blade Runner"", the more vital these stories become.Whatever the box-office-fate of ""Blade Runner 2049"" will be, the long wait has paid off. It is far more than just a quick cash-in on a cult classic or an overly devoted sequel. It stands on its own and adds many new layers to the question: ""What makes us human?"" And it urges us on to find the truth in the rain."
74," A Threesome Without Any Graphic Scene Or Penetration Is Just A tease
","This is the most boring 'could have been' film I have ever seen in my life. The symbolism and iconography are non-existent which is another reason why it is inferior to its prequel.

75," 30 years later, aged like fine wine
","LAPD officer K(Gosling, cynical on the surface) investigates an unusual case. No, sorry, that's all you're getting for plot. If you see someone getting into a lot of detail, avert your eyes. Go into this as blind as Niander(Leto, driven by his cause). Thank me later.This is 2 hours and 33 minutes long, which is not excessive considering how it uses its time. The pacing allows some scenes to go on for a while, however, it's always appropriate. Major props to whoever thought Denis Villeneuve would be right for this. He couldn't be more perfectly chosen. His use of symbolism, exploration of philosophy and compelling themes fit as a companion to the film Ridley Scott created, without merely redoing it(the hints are neat, if perhaps a tad too numerous). This expands upon the issues about Replicants in truly inspired ways(albeit I acknowledge that not all of them were thought up purely for this movie). The acting is sublime. If Joi(Armas, expressing so much with so much forced restraint, for reasons I won't reveal) doesn't break your heart, get an EKG stat, it's stopped beating already. This is not driven by action, rather, the gripping mystery.There is some bloody, even brutal, violence, nudity and disturbing material in this, used well. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys speculative sci-fi. 10/10"
76," What A Sequel Should Be
","If you take a look at the best sequels out there, you'll find that they don't spend an inordinate amount of time retreading old ground at the expense of the story. Rather, a good sequel builds off of the previous film and, if done correctly, not only reinforces the previous film's themes and message, but adds upon them in a meaningful way.Blade Runner 2049 does this correctly, and you don't even have to have seen the original to enjoy this film.Set thirty years after the events of the original film, Blade Runner 2049 focuses on Agent K (Ryan Gosling), a replicant blade runner tasked with hunting down old models that aren't programmed like he is, namely to obey.He stumbles upon a mystery that threatens to unravel the status quo between humans and replicants for good, and through much detective work, he finds himself in the company of Deckard (Harrison Ford), a man living alone with the demons of his past.What the original film did was brilliant in that it explored the human condition without preaching the right answer to our faces, rather it let us ponder the questions it posed so we could come to the conclusions ourselves.This film also poses important questions about humanity, about what qualifies as true feeling, and what the basis for a soul is, but also explores the prospects of science and human ambition, and what happens if it is left unchecked.These themes are explored beautifully by characters on opposite sides of the spectrum, from Jared Leto as Wallace, the man who picks up the mantle of the Tyrell Corporation, to Ana de Ames as Joi, a holographic woman who is K's companion and who longs to be more than an incorporeal image.It cannot be denied that this film is a visual masterpiece, every bit on par with Ridley Scott's original.What faults there are lie with the length of the film (2 hours 43 minutes, and it feels it, especially towards the end) and with the music. While powerful and evocative of the original soundtrack, for every time it conveys an emotional gut punch, there's another time where it's really only there to be a loud noise, and it can get annoying at times. A little more restraint on the horns would have been appreciated.Nevertheless, this film has everything a film buff would want, and even if that's not you, it's definitely worth a watch as an intellectual think-piece to discuss over dinner with friends."
77," Boring, missing the point of the original
","In the ongoing tradition of Harrison Ford's Action heroes of the 1980's turning out to be really terrible dads, we have Blade Runner 2049, the sequel to 1982's Blade Runner. We meet a replicant cop named K who is of a new variety that doesn't rebel unlike those bad ones in the movies. So he tracks down a Runaway Nexus 8, even though in the original movie, we were assured that Nexus 8's only had 4 year lifespans. During the course of this, they discover the bones of Sean Young's character from the original movie, along with the realization she had given birth. Our hero also has a relationship with a Hologram Girl for some reason. I guess so he is sad when she gets deleted later in the movie. If you are watching this movie to see Harrison Ford reprise his role as Deckard, you don't get to see him walking around like someone's confused grandpa until 2 hours into an interminably long movie. (Seriously, I feel bad for Ford. Why does he do this to himself?)So they want to find the child of Deckard and Rachel because this is a replicant that can reproduce, which is supposedly more efficient than just growing them, for some reason. They say they need more replicants to colonize the outer colonies, but of course, there are plenty of people living in squalor, including a child labor sweatshop. I can't emphasize enough how long, boring, uninteresting this movie was. It's like they watched the original and still had no idea what made it a good movie."
78," Outstanding, long awaited sequel to Ridley Scott's 1982 original
","Blade Runner 2049 - Arrival director Denis Villeneuve creates a lengthy,yet outstanding follow up to Ridley Scott's compelling sci- fi film noir.For those who have either never seen or, for a good while, haven't seen the original 1982 Blade Runner, it would behoove them to watch it and familiarize/ re-familiarize themselves with it. Sicario/Arrival helmer Denis Villeneuve has forged such a excellent, tightly connected sequel to Ridley Scott's enthralling, and futuristic sci-fi noir, that most elements will be foreign if you don't look back at what's happened before.Notwithstanding, after 35 years of near unbearable patience, the long awaited follow up to a film that has been called, the most compelling vision of the future ever created, has finally arrived. Blade Runner 2049 is thankfully, a direct sequel to it's illustrious predecessor, logically as well as creatively attached to the previous events of the early 80's innovative film.Thirty years following Rick Deckard's running off with Rachel, during the only hope filled, sunlit scene in the original Blade Runner, there obviously has been some considerable changes, in the City of Angels, and our world since then, whereas some have remained constant. Suitable title cards grant us a brief history so all can catch up with what has transpired, picking up in the 2020's up to the present year. This includes a devastating event called Blackout which completely paralyzes all of human society.Because of rebellious ""flaws"" in the Tyrell Corporations Nexus replicants, they eventually went bankrupt, and the company is taken over by blind industrialist Niandor Wallace (Jared Leto), riding in on a proverbial white horse to save the day. He is the brilliant creator of the new Nexus 9 model replicants who are remarkably more obedient than their dissident forebears - and still used for slave labor. His careful study of human history has reminded him that civilizations were built on the backs of slaves. Plus, as he soberly admits, he can only make so many.Naturally, some of the old Nexus 6, 7 and 8 skin jobs are still around, and as always, ""retired"" by Blade Runners like LAPD officer K (Ryan Gosling). During a retirement mission involving Guardians of the Galaxy's Dave Bautista as humble farmer Sapper Morton, he discovers a small metal box buried under the side of a tree by the replicant's house. Upon a thorough investigation he discovers information concerning a certain fellow Blade Runner and female Nexus 6 replicant from 30 years prior.The archaic data has such riveting implications, it eventually leads K to that certain fellow Blade Runner, namely Harrison Ford's Rick Deckard, to find concrete answers to something that could effect all of humanity- including replicants. Something no one, probably not even Dr. Tyrell, could have possibly conceived.Ridley Scott's Blade Runner (based on Philip K. Dick's ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep), was definitely unlike any other film most, if not some, had ever seen, especially the opening fade in of a dark foreboding Los Angeles showcasing a stark array of austere buildings, and flames of fire literally shooting from the tops of incredibly tall skyscrapers. Cinematographer Roger Deakins and production designer Dennis Gassner have perfect sc-fi noir chemistry in re- creating that same atmosphere,notwithstanding a few more hope filled, slightly subdued sunlit scenes to counterbalance the dark ones. Even Han Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch's sterling score is evocative of Greek composer Vangelis's haunting music that perfectly melded with the film's disquieting resonance.While it's agreeable to see a fresh young, face, aggressively carrying out his duties of what is still called a Blade Runner, even after 30 years, the most provocative mainstay is definitely the return of Harrison Ford. 2049 simply could not have been done without him. It takes awhile within the 2 hour, 40 minute plus running time to finally re-introduce him to fans. But it's well worth the avid anticipation. Ford's Rick Deckard provides sufficient closure to a story fans have been waiting for since 1982."
79," A warning from the future
","Director Denis Villeneuve and screenwriter Hampton Fancher (in collaboration with Michael Green) get things off to a great start by dusting down an omitted scene originally intended for the 80's classic. Ryan Gosling's Blade Runner, Officer K (Dick?), discovers a long buried secret whilst on a 'retirement' mission outside the walls of future LA. This sets the wheels in motion for a gripping, highly intriguing 2 hours 63 minutes of hallucinogenic dystopian wet dreams, as Gosling hunts for the hunter - Rick Deckard, who has been missing for 30 years...So, how far have we come between 2019 and 2049? Well, the mash-up of all things vintage and cyber-punk have been aggressively separated out, finding the former unceremoniously tossed over the city wall to wilt and die in the misty post apocalyptic wilderness. The latter's underclass are forced into the Soylent Green over-crowding of Gosling's dead-end high-rise habit, leaving the overlords to bask in their sleek minimalist creature comforts behind closed doors.The rich/poor divide is breathtakingly realised courtesy of perfectly nuanced art direction (think Gattaca meets Brazil) and Roger Deakins' achingly beautiful DP work. The lighting, design and colour schemes deployed in the perfectly timed build-up to Officer K's face-to-face with you-know-who, has to rate amongst one of the best directed sequences I've ever seen. It's almost like watching the greatest moment Kubrick never made.Benjamin Wallfisch & Hans Zimmer's hammering Vangelis on steroids soundtrack feels less like music and more the organic hyperventilating of the gloomy Metropolis it supports. In fact ‚Äì and I do mean this as a compliment - it's sometimes difficult to tell where (outstanding) sound design ends and music score begins (and vice versa).OK, that's the gravy. But what really make this outing so enduring are Villeneuve & the writers' commitment to telling a story with characters and themes that are well worth your time. The ideas and threads presented in Ridley Scott's masterpiece and PKD's original source material are built upon quite substantially, juggling elemental symbolism (snow, rain & seawater equating life, death & rebirth) with the big existential questions of what it means to be human and the tragic disconnect that intervenes.Whether it be by design, social-standing, physical-handicap or grim circumstance, every single character here - Gosling's perfectly muted, curiously Roy Batty attired, drone law-enforcer, Ana De Armis' sweet & tragic hologram Joi, Robin Wright's gutsy police chief Joshi, Harrison Ford's meaty, bladey, big & besty Deckard etc ‚Äì is a slave. Like the original, no one here is in control - not even boo-hiss villains Wallace and his tearful hit-woman, Luv (played superbly by Jared Leto & Sylvia Hoeks respectively). Like everyone else, they too are manipulated by the puppet master society that has been allowed to grow around them, a dark warning from the future if ever there was one.Any negatives? Whilst I honestly can't think of a single scene that shouldn't be there, some moments could do with a trim as Leto's scenes do tend to ramble on a bit. The action too, whilst still sparing, adheres more to the crowd-pleasing variety this time round, with the finale going a tad too good-guy vs bad guy/damsel-in- distress for comfort. That said the fantastically skilled Villeneuve's work behind the camera insures it always remains as credible as anything else he's ever done involving punch-ups and explosions.The pace, like the original, is sedate and deliberate, the mood, a mix of oppressive brooding and melancholic bewilderment. Several passages enticingly emit the same kind of foreboding and dread normally found in the best horror movies, and the outcome retains the same downbeat ambiguity as before. The final moment, is perfect.Was this sequel necessary? I thought it would be nay, but I'm happy to say it's a yay! This Blade Runner may share ticks and traits lifted from its predecessor - and it's too soon to say if it will go on to achieve the same reputation as Scott's signature movie ‚Äì but thanks to the artistry and craftsmanship of Villeneuve and everyone else involved, the goods have turned up freshly minted with a personality all its own, delivering a tale that resonates loudly with the here and now. It deserves your attention. 9/10."

","I wanted to believe the hype, i truly did - don't get me wrong though, the movie was great, the effects and the scenery was amazing; the movie in itself had a peculiar simple message;"" Believe in Love and Miracles will happen "".For Hollywood to tell a tale about love nowadays is unique, even more uncommon to tell it with a huge franchise since most of them are destroyed by clueless, uneducated and privileged writers who lacks the imagination and creativity to write a simple tale about a virtue or any virtue; writing a story isn't hard, it just takes time and dedication to understand the purpose and meaning of a story, and it isn't subjective.If you want to see a love story in a sci-fi environment;"" Its great "". If you want to see an action movie;"" Its great "". if you want it to be a BladeRunner sequel,then I'm gonna be honest and say; ""It is"" - but is it the greatest movie of the year for me; ""No"".It is a great movie to see with your friends or with your partner and it has a little of everything for everybody to leave with a smile."
81," The film of the year so far.........
","Blade Runner 2049 is the best film I have seen so far this year. Normally a sequel is dreadful compared to its original brother and with this being the decade for terrible sequels and reboots, like Alien Covenant and Kingsmen 2, 2049 is actually great. This film is Gorgeous in the same way as the original and actually stands apart from the original in such a way as to be a completely different film. It tips its hat to the original Blade Runner but stands on its own two feet. The story is a continuation from the original set 30 years in the future. I will not ruin the plot for you in any way as you need to see this film. I will say that the plot does revolve around the same kind of themes that the original does however it's done in such a refreshing and creative way that it leaves you with a lot of questions. It Revolves around what it means to be human as the last one did but also throws in love, revenge, sacrifice and wraps it all up with stunning performances from all but one member of the cast. Gosling is the main protagonist and does an excellent job of portraying the is-he-isn't-he replicant ""K"". In most of his performances Gosling does give quite a robotic performance with a few choice parts of emotion. This usually is his acting MO but unlike some of his other films, where it doesn't work, the robotic acting he does in this film suits his character. The writing team obviously wrote K well and Gosling listened to them and made the character work. The scenes where he loses it and shows emotional sides are brilliant and really enjoyable. Also the love he shows for Joi in their scenes is really affectionate and believable. I don't usually like him but in this I have to say to was brilliant and really took me into his character and what K is feeling and thinking. Ana De Armas is great as Joi, as with Gosling she is amazingly adept at portraying the complexity of a self-aware AI hologram and you feel a connection to her plight of wanting to be as human as human can be. Robin Wright is great as the LAPD lieutenant as she plays a great supporting character who strangely enough is less human than the replicants are but is genuinely human¬Ö.weird.Harrison Ford was the main focus of the films advertising and trailers however if you are looking forward to more Deckard you will be slightly disappointed. He is not in the film for very long and has little impact on the plot for the first 2/3rds of the film. While some people are b*tching about this and giving the film a 1/10 (which is a total di*k move) for not having Deckard be the main guy, I think it is refreshing to not rehash old characters to death. Deckard does advance the plot along and gives K something to hope for but K is the main protagonist and that is, in my opinion, a good thing. Jared Leto was boring as the ""villain"" in this film. His acting was terrible all of his dialog was weird and did nothing for me. His speech about angels was completely boring and did nothing to advance the plot and every time he was on screen the pacing felt slowed down. His whole character did not feel interesting and I was so underwhelmed. Luckily he is only in two scenes and his replicant LUV is a great character. She gives us a suspenseful, menacing, emotional antagonist who advances the plot well and is actually more human than her human boss. Like the first film the effects in this are beautiful. The use of CGI adds to the story and is very tasteful. The scene where Joi is trying to make love to K is a brilliant example of CGI adding to the story, honesty it is so good I was astonished at how real it looked. The use of colour is very well done as well. Brilliant cinematography, great use of a golden colour palette, honestly the effects department should be really proud, amazing work. The camera work is very interesting with great sweeping shots of the futuristic LA skyline and the First shot of the eye at the start really gets you interested in what's to come and is a unique way to start a film. I listen very closely to the music in films and I have to say that this is one of the best examples I've seen recently of music adding to a film a making the scenes special. The music in this builds suspense, evokes emotion and adds to the characters and their setting exactly the right way.The use of ""soundless"" music is used to great effect, giving you suspenseful scenes without any sound to add to the eerie feeling in the scenes. It is important to use music but sometimes lack of music can be just as important and creative. This film is a perfect example of a great use of music and the sound department did an awesome job.Overall this film the best film I have seen this year and while it does have a few little flaws. The pacing is slow in places, Leto's performance is not great and the nearly 3 hour running time is a hard ask for people with short attention spans. I think over all this film is really good and a testament to sequels being as good as their originals. As I said at the start this film is refreshing and tips its hat slightly to Blade Runner however Blade Runner 2049 is a great film in its own right. I urge you to go see for yourselves."
82," A Masterpiece of modern cinema
","The finest film I have ever seen.Yes, a masterpiece of canon, and style, and production. Spare and sensual, with an extraordinary central performance by Ryan Gosling, great plotting and dialogue in an examination of the nature of love, of memory and of identity. The best of science fiction in that it explores who we really are under almost inconceivable stresses.You can feel the love and effort poured into this movie in every second of film. The music evokes and expands on the original, returns us to this future we know so well from so long ago now.Remember: Science fiction has no ceiling.10 stars."
83," Ghastly, ghastliness, ear-bleeding loud, don't believe the silly reviews above.
","Spoilers ahead.Updated Nov 2019:I just finished reading Future Noir: The Making of Blade Runner by Paul M. Sammon, a decent enough book although most of the book seems pretty well covered by the superb documentary ""Dangerous Days"" by Charles de Lauzirika. The book (Future Noir) was written in 2017 so everyone is all agog about the upcoming Blade Runner ""sequel"" and it's so disappointing to look back on the movie in this light. I can't even remember virtually anything ABOUT BR 2049. Apart from the awful, pointless ""fight"" between Harrison Ford and Ryan Gosling. I saw the original in 1982 and it stayed with me for years, until I saw it again on TV or VHS. Great movies are like that, they linger and haunt you forever. I can't imagine anyone thinking again or wanting to watch BR 2049 again as it plays on HBO or elsewhere.Who writes reviews titled: ""One of the best sequels of all time!"" and ""A masterpiece of science fiction and possibly one of the greatest sequels ever made"" and ""A New-Age Sci-Fi Classic""?? Yep, studio shills, hacks, and trolls. These are the kind of reviews which used to get knocked off Yelp because they were so ridiculously and archly over-effusive. Real, regular folk (like you and me dontcha know) don't go in for ratings viewing boosting titles. Read: box office boosters. ""Yeah, I know you loved in mom but it ain't THAT good. Aww."" They're like testimonials on a CV\resume you've written yourself and then re-read months later and realize you've overdone it. Akk. ""Mark really is the best thing since sliced bread. He's the most amazing film reviewer in a generation....""Yep, I own the 7 DVD European version boxed set. Yes, I saw it at the Electric Theatre in Brixton when it came out. I love the original. I wanted so much to love the sequel. Most of my peeves are listed above and below, mirrored by other reviewers with whom I have forged an unhappy bond of disappointment and disbelief. And I concur. Harrison Ford was too passive. Ryan Gosling was too dull, too toned down. Sean Young's CGI was awful. Why not have her at an age like she is now? HF is nearly 80, so how about a 55-year-old Rachel. CGI of real people is tough - it never looks real and it didn't here. The set lighting was sub-par, the CGI buildings didn't look real. This is all ""by the by"" - if there had been a real script, a real story then all would be forgiven. The movie started, for me, when Joe gets to Vegas. That's how the trailer editor saw it and that's how you should see it. Get a drink join the movie about 90 minutes in and it's really not that bad after that. Some of the stuff is great. But most of it, including the eardrum-bursting ""Music"" (which was interesting in Arrival) but here, merely serves to pretend to elicit emotion. As another viewer mentioned: when the film finished, the lights suddenly went on (this was Studio Movie Grill so they needed to clean the food trays etc.) as if the theater was embarrassed at the movie's length and wanted to shuffle us out in a hurry. There was no applause, heck even mediocre films in LA get applause since half the audience works in the industry as grips, extras, teamsters etc., even in the outskirts of town. We all just shuffled out, stunned, not quite understanding how $185 million dollars in Budapest (where they made it) could have born so little fruit. Heck, you could BUY Budapest for $185m right? ;) This seems to be a very polarizing film. Lots of critics seem to like it. My wife liked it. I hated it. I hated myself for looking forward to it. I woke up depressed. I wanted to slap the screen and say: ""That's for making me care about you!"" Wack!"
84," This is the Unicorn Version And Done by Ridley!
","Great for insomniacsIf you want to be bored to tears or have trouble sleeping then please watch this slow-paced, unthrilling trash.
Also it makes no sense that life is so comfortable and wife is so attractive when the whole place is supposed to be dystopia.I mean there is free alcohol waiting for you at a casino and hookers surround you and none of them are fat.
See this is not dystopia. This is Ridley becoming the studio hack he once hated and filming a unicorn version of Blade Runner."
85," Breathtaking - A Near Perfect Cinematic Achievement
","I am going to offend when I write how the original Blade Runner left me disappointed. By the end, there were too many unanswered questions for me not to feel anything but jaded. Blade Runner 2049 on the other hand, left me riveted. Ryan Gosling is not exactly synonymous with action films, though from the opening scene, he proves himself to be a powerful, heroic figure. Unlike the original, which toyed with the idea that Deckard was a replicant, 2049 adamantly admits to K's (Gosling) status almost immediately. Though I could criticise Blade Runner 2049 for its anti-climatic finish, it does three things brilliantly. First, the film answers the burning questions the original refused to dignify. Secondly, the film captures the essence of the original's universe. The world feels lived in; where technology and the metal skeletons of architecture blend; where clear demographics and political allegiances exist, an 'us versus them' feel emerging that mirrors the world we live in today. Thirdly, the film immerses the viewer instantly with not just the mystery of its story, but with its score. The sound is thunderous and impactful, exploding across the screen with tremendous effect, while the raw, visceral musical score accompanies this perfectly, serenading us with themes that don't just resemble, in part, the original, but a unique cyber punk style too.The effects are phenomenal, from the fluctuating holographic interfaces, to the flying cars; from the impressive explosions to the dystopian backwaters which surround the spurring metropolis; the effects satisfyingly developing an imperfect future. Although the effects are a necessity in Blade Runner 2049, never does the feature become over-reliant on them, the film's leads been the driving force of this cinematic achievement.The film's introduction sees K completing his manhunt of Sapper Morton (Dave Bautista), an older model replicant, who has found some semblance of peace. K however finds himself caught up in an even bigger investigation, the ramifications of which could be dire, his lieutenant, Joshi (portrayed effectively by Robin Wright), spurring her infallible asset on. It is here we are introduced to Jared Leto's Niander Wallace, the mastermind behind the new generation replicants. Despite been in only a few scenes, his calculated malice sends cold tones throughout the feature, and is further delivered upon by his assistant, Luv (Sylvia Hoecks), whose lack of decency for human life is frighteningly human.Much like the original, Blade Runner 2049 questions what makes us human, and why in the future we would attempt to differentiate ourselves from our creation, when they begin to adopt our traits. Though Gosling's K appears robotic in his movements at times, in his relationships, especially that with virtual intelligence Joi (the lovely Ana De Armas), we witness how human he truly is, their romance been as inventive as it is beautiful. The film takes itself very seriously when demonstrating the poignancy of machines sharing a connection, though the themes of slavery and child-labour, despite still been major topics today, are only briefly discussed.Acting greats like the always entertaining Lenny James, Hiam Abbas, and Edward James Olmos (reprising his role from the original) briefly appear, and despite portraying characters with barely enough screen time to be truly appreciated, their performances nonetheless propel the narrative forward. Furthermore, though Harrison Ford receives second billing, it is not until much later into the film that we are blessed by his on screen presence, his version of Deckard retaining the old 'shoot first ask questions later' routine of his character, yet being deeply melancholic and sympathetic. Blade Runner 2049 is at its core, a futuristic romance, about the importance of freedom, sacrifice and family; a film that gives me hope for the future of Hollywood. This feature is possibly the best film I have seen this year, Denis Vileneuve again proving himself to be an outstanding director."
86," Blazing new ground, despite the (now obligatory) dystopian vision
","Well, Blade Runner 2049 certainly lives up to the hype, and did anyone mention the soundtrack? Wow. I should, however, expand a little on my recurring critique of dystopian science fiction, since it's about the only kind of scifi you can find at the movies, and Blade Runner 2049 falls into the genre like almost everything else in the scifi category these (unimaginative) days. Dystopian visions of the future abound, but overlook (1) that a lot --- if not most --- of our present problems will be solved --- even in the intermediate future a few decades hence, and (2) that the problems of the future (apart from human nature, which basically never changes) will most likely be substantially different than the problems of today. It's hard to see how a fusion-powered, robotics and biotech-enhanced future is going to be characterized by poverty and homelessness, just for example. Overcrowding? Yes. Few jobs for unskilled workers? Quite obviously. Human nature? The same as ever, as mentioned above. So, despite its slipping into the #dystopiaasusual category, Blade Runner 2049 may possibly be the greatest science fiction film ever produced. Surely there has never been another soundtrack quite like this one, and I'm ready to award the set designers every prize on the shelf. Ryan Gosling is talented enough to carry the lead, and he was very well- supported, including by a re-energized Harrison Ford, who has pulled himself back from the edge of the abyss. Denis Villeneuve has now established that he can do anything (he's now talking about revisiting the Dune narrative; and somebody should actually introduce him to Heinlein and Asimov if he's drifting towards the classics in the genre). So, despite some caveats, this production burns so much new ground that my call is 10/10."
87," As Beautiful and Intriguing as Tears in Rain...
","From an original 1982 theatrical showing to a Beta videotape, to a standard laserdisc, to a deluxe Criterion letterbox laserdisc, to a DVD, to a high-definition blu-ray, Ridley Scott's ""Blade Runner"" has been viewed countless times in the original voice-over version, the European cut, the director's cut, and the final cut over the 35 years that followed its release. All those memories have not been lost in time, like tears in rain, but rather are indelible images from one of the greatest science fiction films. Thus, any thought of a sequel evokes mixed emotions. Despite the involvement of Ridley Scott, the results could be another disaster like ""More American Graffiti,"" or an undistinguished but palatable followup like ""2010,"" or a companion masterpiece like ""The Godfather Part II."" Fortunately, ""Blade Runner"" cultists can breathe a sigh of relief; while ""Blade Runner 2049"" may fall short of the unqualified masterpiece status of ""The Godfather"" sequel, at least on an initial viewing, the film enhances and builds upon, rather than diminishes, the original; however, only time will determine if ""BR2049"" will enjoy the same repeatability as the first film and join it as a timeless classic.Fresh from his outstanding work on ""Arrival,"" director Denis Villeneuve helmed ""BR2049"" with a steady hand and attention to detail, which were likely guided or inspired by Ridley Scott. Set thirty years ahead of the original film, Roger Deakins's career-best cinematography captures a future that is colder and bleaker than that portrayed by Jordan Cronenweth's original work, which has a warmer tone. However, Deakins's cooler hues are appropriate for 2049 Los Angeles, where snow has replaced rain and holographs rule rather than neon. Warm or cool, the atmospherics in both films are equally dazzling. The aurals are as captivating as the visuals; the haunting music by Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch evokes the original Vangelis score without plagiarizing.The casting is also superb with Ryan Gosling spot on as K, the blade runner whose job, like Deckard's in the original film, is to retire renegade replicants. While the role may lack showy moments for an actor, Gosling's tall lean figure and enigmatic face create an image possibly more enduring than that of Harrison Ford in the original. Both Ford as an aging Rick Deckard and Edward James Olmos as a retired Gaff return to link the sequel to the first film. Among the newcomers, Robin Wright is well cast as Gosling's deadly serious, deathly pale Lieutenant Joshi of the LAPD. Ford and Olmos are not the only returnees, an origami figure and a small wood carving wordlessly connect the two Blade Runner films, and implanted memories, flying cars, outsized advertising, and transparent plastic raincoats also have encores.""Blade Runner"" cultists are best served seeing the sequel knowing little; the story unfolds as a policeman sent in pursuit of a mystery that expands upon threads in the original movie. Tthe film's length is arguably excessive, especially for those unfamiliar with the original, and ""Blade Runner"" novices may be left behind by a leisurely narrative that prizes visuals above action. However, ""Blade Runner 2049"" is that rarity of movie sequels, a film that enhances and elevates the original, yet stands on its own as a masterful film. The passage of time will determine if ""Blade Runner 2049"" and ""Blade Runner"" become the inseparably coupled films that ""The Godfather"" and ""The Godfather Part II"" have become, but all the elements are in place."
88," This is why we watch movies
","As the final scene of 'Bladerunner 2049' came to an end and the credits began to roll I found myself a bit shocked that nearly 3 hours had elapsed.I had spent the entirety of the run-time completely entranced into the world Denis Villeneuve and his crew had masterfully constructed. To be swept up in the imagination and realized vision of artists who take such care with every shot is a fine experience to have in the cinema. 'Bladerunner' 2049' seemingly transcends being a mere sequel and becomes a full fledged film in it's own right. A film that just happens to share a universe with another.While the story and themes of 'Bladerunner 2049' are familiar they are done with such finesse that we can't help but feel empathy for the characters as they struggle to find their humanity, or simply try to make a connection.There are small flaws in the film if you choose to go over it with a microscope, but the best way to watch 'Bladerunner 2049' is to let it wash over your senses and to just experience it.This is why we watch movies."
89," The Blade Runner Sequel
",One of the most disappointing movies i have ever seen this move made me cry because the prequel was so good. The blonde prostitute was cute though.
90," A Beautiful and Poetic Film
","Well, it's not what I expected but it was very good. A beautiful film with a of lot complex interactions.Roger Deakins' cinematography was great. The director, Denis Villeneuve, is the same guy that did 'Arrival' which I thought was good but not as good as other people thought and 'Prisoners'. He may be someone to watch. The direction in this is very strong.They avoided the 'let's do a scene like in first movie but make it BIGGER' ploy that flaws most 'sequels'. And it really doesn't feel like a sequel. It's a different story and while it builds on the the first it goes in a really interesting direction. I liked also that Deckard's role wasn't tacked on as an after thought. It's really sort of poetic and I'd like to see it again so I can get some of things I didn't get in the first go around. I gave it a 9 but I'm pretty sure that's going to change to a 10 with a little time. It really holds it's on in comparison with the original and if this is the approach they want to take with a possible 3rd movie I'm totally on board."
91," Slow and beautiful
","I guess if the producers wanted to make another Blade Runner, they totally succeeded - at least so far. As with the original Blade Runner the visuals are the ones that people will refer to when it comes to this movie. And it's not just because of the Academy Awards. You can tell all by yourself and I reckon even without having seen it on an IMAX screen (though I would have recommended it and still am).Having said all that, the movie has also the same irritating feeling about it, that the original Blade Runner had. So in almost every aspect it is a successor to it. Story wise obviously too, though I guess this one has a couple of shorts that play before this movie, that are supposed to get you in the mood. They are not necessary to watch, but they are also very well made. This movie is an experience and it is one you have to be willing to make.While it does have some action scenes, while it is Science Fiction, it does play more like a slow moving drama with a lot of mystery elements to it. If that sounds intriguing to you, with some added social commentary flavor, than by all means watch it. But beware that you have to have patience with it ..."

93," May possibly be an overlooked classic on release - deja vu anyone??? ;)
","At time of writing, Blade Runner 2049 looks like it might underwhelm at the box office. There are probably a few reasons for that: the R rating obviously keeps children and young people, and families away; a demographic in the 18-25 range is probably pretty unfamiliar with the original movie; and its 2 hr 43 min running time probably feeling taxing to a number of contemporary moviegoers who are used to an hour and a half.However, here are my responses to each of these points: ¬ï this is the kind of ""thoughtful couples/date type movie"" for when your kids are at their grandparents or babysitters; or it would make a great works night out to watch this¬ï if you're unfamiliar because you're pretty young with the classic original Blade Runner movie, you're admitting to missing out on a classic piece of cinema that you need to watch (up there with the original Star Wars; the Godfather; the Shawshank Redemption etc.) So do yourself a favour, and rent or buy it now, rather than watch the latest average to shoddy Maze Runner sequel; ¬ï if you're put off by a film's running time, then do you really have a love of cinema at its fullest and finest?Very important the last bit, because in my opinion, this is arguably the best sci-fi sequel since Terminator 2, way back in 1991. It respects, builds on and pays homage to the original film, without being constrained by it, whilst making us look again at the original film with a new eye. Without giving away any notable spoilers, the story continues and advances the conflict of replicants pitted against humans. Whether the divide between the two parties may be coming closer to an end is illustrated in a creative and thought provoking plot development (involving the characters of the original film), which I genuinely didn't expect. The characters here are fleshed out, conflicted, and portrayed as complex and realistic, give how Earth has so tragically ended up in the environment this franchise creates. Whilst most actors here give a sterling performance, with few off notes, I'm happy to note that in a film which needed him to carry the weight of the narrative and mythos, Ryan Gosling (not my favourite actor) is outstanding in an understated, often subtle performance that marks as one of the finest of his career. I'd also probably give Robin Wright credit for her turn as the prejudiced, conflicted and brutal Lt. Joshi; Harrison Ford (who plays a latter act part, but is nevertheless a key role) gives his best performance for a character in years as a now wizened Deckard. It's interesting that, compared to the pre advertising buildup of him, Jared Leto doesn't get as much screen time as you might expect ‚Äì although he's competent in what time he does have.Of course Blade Runner stories are hugely about visuals: whilst much has been said for cinematographer Roger Deakins being Oscar nominated for this (he should be), the visual effects team really have done sterling work overall. The visual look is stunning and seamless ‚Äì an understandable, logical and beautiful progression from the universe of the first film, that makes me hugely excited to own this at home on Blu Ray. It's one of the few films I would recommend seeing in 3D: the effect of it is subtle and not garish as can be in 3D, and it nicely enhances certain scenes, rather than distracts from them.So¬Ö any quibbles at all? Thankfully, only a few: a brief cameo from a very well loved and intriguing character of the first film is sadly all we get from that character. The score is satisfactory, and services the visuals and plot well, but it can't really come close to the classic Vangelis original. In my mind, the only person who should have really been approached for this sequel is Vangelis himself, but maybe he turned it down. We don't know. The film also ends on an intriguing cliffhanger ‚Äì one which is dependent on certain characters being available and happy in future to film a subsequent sequel. I'd have probably preferred the ending to be one that could make the film a stand-alone film, like the original, whilst allowing for the possibility of sequels.Still, these are minor quibbles overall. Hopefully it will make enough through box office receipts and home video and TV (remember, it's the latter two that led Blade Runner to become a cult hit over time, rather than the original box office receipts) to make a Villeneuve led sequel. If not him, the only other two people I can ever imagine doing that sequel might be Christopher Nolan or Ridley Scott. However, let this man at it again, he'd done a fantastic job here.In summary: a brilliant achievement, which hopefully opens the doorway for another film to make what might hopefully then be the best sci- fi trilogy in history ‚Äì aping the Lord Of The Rings trilogy for fantasy, and the Dark Knight trilogy for the superhero comic book genre. If this gets ignored by the Oscars for the usual costume dramas, biopics, and rote drama films, there should be hell to pay."
94," Satisfying Sequel to a Sci-Fi Cult Classic
","Blade Runner 2049 lives up to die hard Fans for the original 1982 Classic directed by Ridley Scott. I didn't see the original film until it came on HBO or Showtime when I was a kid growing up in the 80's. But, over the years, the movie strucked me and it grew. And after watching it over and over again on DVD since R. Scott's director's cut in 2007. There so many editions of it released on DVD and Blu-Ray. But I have the Directors cut. So let's get to it. This film is brilliantly directed by Denis Villenvenue. When I saw it, I wasn't expecting a fast paced action film. All the elements in the film was what I expected. Yes, it's CGIED up but you have to understand in the Blade Runner world things changed out there in LA. The film is slow paced and it grows through out to the end so the audience could get a sense of what's this new film's about. After 30 years, it's 2049, new Blade Runner Officer K (Ryan Gosling) tries to track down and search for Deckard (H.Ford). And that's it. Gosling's performance was good but while you're watching it, you immediately want to see Harrison Ford and Gosling couldn't hold the film for too long. Los Angeles is different. The setting and the cinematography is outstanding by Roger Deakins. Great acting by the supporting cast. Jared Leto is great as Wallace the new manufacturer of new replicants. Robin Wright is always good in any role she plays as a Police Chief of the LAPD. Actually who steals the film is Sylvia Hoesk, as an evil replicant that will do anything to get what she wants.Overall, the Film is great but you have watch it several times to get a better understanding and all the questions will be answered. Yes, the film is long 2hours 45minutes yet it's worth it. The music is wild and moving by Hans Zimmerman. Visually Stunning and Unbelievable. Rating: 8.5/10"
95," It Was So Boring I thought JJ Abrams Must Be The Director

Where is the crescendo? Where is the meaning??? What? Replicants can now give birth? So they are not replicants anymore and can be considered bona fide humans so what is the morale of all of this??"
96," Disappointing
","Admittedly, I did not enjoy the prospects of a Blade Runner sequel, since I considered the first installment to be a one-off story, for which a sequel would ultimately harm.Unfortunately, this movie did just that. I did not like the plot at all, which I considered both ridiculous and tacky, despite being drenched in massive amounts of self-importance. The visuals were nice, and lots of care seemed to be made to maintain the original's style. The problem is, again, the story, narrative, etc. I'd say it's worth a watch, but I don't believe many will return for a second viewing"
97," A great sequel that is jaw dropping
","This film has been gaining a lot of hype with some people saying it is the best film of the year, I have now seen blade runner 2049 and I really enjoyed it. The premise of the film is set 30 years after the original seeing a new blade runner attempt to work out a mystery that could rock society. Ryan gosling plays agent k the main blade runner in this film and he does a great job carrying this film on his shoulders as the lead. He adds depth to his role as he goes through a real journey of discovery throughout the film which builds a lot of layers to the role. Harrison Ford reprises his role of deckard and he is really great in the film. He isn't in the film that much but when he is he owns every scene that he is in. Jared leto and Robin wright are in smaller roles in the film and they both do very solid jobs with what they are given to work with, which isn't that much. I really liked the character of goslings AI romantic interest and I was fully invested in them and there struggles in the film. The story similar to the first film has a lot of philosophical question's raised and they are interesting enough, I enjoyed watching the investigation that gosling had to go through in the film and as mentioned before the romance was a real strong point. But similar to the first film I feel like this film attempts too many sub plots that I really didn't care about that just caused the film to have a much longer run time then was necessary, which I will go into later. The script is very good, with a lot of well written dialogue that helps make these characters interesting to watch, mixed in with a little bit of fun humour too. The style of the film has jaw dropping amazing visual effects that really need to be seen to be believed, with some decent action scenes as well. However, now to the pacing of the film, this film is nearly 3 hours long and it really shouldn't have been. The film takes its time but to a ridiculous degree at times that will have you would dieting if you are enjoying the film, but I managed to pull through. Overall I actually prefer this film to the original blade runner and think it should definitely be seen especially if you are a fan of the original."
98," Overall, Great
","Whichever user wrote that when Harrison Ford appeared the movie took a turn for the worse should never review movies anymore. Ford was outstanding.If I have one complaint about this film, it's that it's a bit too in love with its visuals, so its pace is too deliberate and plodding for me. When Ford's Deckard character finally makes his entrance the film picks up the pace, and I perked up a bit. But it might be too late for some people.This Blade Runner world is as rich and engaging as the previous '80s film-- complete with dreariness and grayness galore. It has its regular scruffy-looking replicants and even deeper questions about what it means to be human.I like Gosling, but he was usually devoid of emotion in this film. Ford picks up the slack and adds more than enough flesh tones to reel in that slack. The supporting cast is great, and the story is immersive. I just thought that director Denis Villeneuve and his video editors could have made it trimmer and busier."
99," pure cinema
","It's 2049 Los Angeles. K (Ryan Gosling) is a Blade Runner hunting for old Nexus 8 replicants under LAPD Lieutenant Joshi (Robin Wright). After the 2022 blackout, most records have been erased or corrupted. Tyrell is out of business and replicant production had been outlawed until Niander Wallace (Jared Leto). Wallace is producing a new obedient replicant. Luv (Sylvia Hoeks) is his replicant henchwoman. K hunts down an old Nexus 8 and in the process, he discovers a surprise which leads to Deckard (Harrison Ford). Joi (Ana de Armas) is K's holographic computer girlfriend. Mariette (Mackenzie Davis) is a prostitute.This is pure cinema although I can see some object to the length and dark depressing sensibilities. For the most part, the action is not intended to be fun. Some people will feel the long running time more than others. An easy test is whether the person likes the original or any cyberpunk sci-fi anime. This takes the original's visual mastery and adds a more compelling detective mystery. Any BR fan will undoubtedly love this unless they are some nitpicking fanatic. Non-fans may find this more appealing... or not.The original's detective story and pacing are its major flaws. This sequel has a real detective story with a real mystery. The writing is impeccable. The designs take the original vision and dives right in. Roger Deakins' work is beyond beautiful. Villeneuve is at the top of his game. Gosling is a more effective lead. Ford comes in during the second half and is a more fun Deckard. Ana de Armas is a gorgeous vision of girl perfection. Sylvia Hoeks is an amazing villain. The movie tackles all of the ideas without hitting one over the head. This is a great film although I'm not sure if popular modern audience will take to it. The opening box office certainly does not suggest that."
100," Honestly, over-hyped and mediocre at best
","There's a lot to like about this movie. Ryan Gosling gives a fantastic performance, both nuanced and surprisingly emotional. The action, when there is action, is well filmed and brutal and fun to watch. The CGI is pretty much flawless, and I'm not joking when I say that while watching this movie, you'll think you're watching a real world. The film is interesting, it's well shot, well directed, it's visually stunning, it's pretty, and the score is very thrilling. But as a whole, this movie is just so god da*n boring. Look, I like slow paced movies, but this film is beyond slow paced. It's brain dead. It's literally like watching a person with no arms and legs try to crawl across a football field. I won't lie, at first I liked this slow pace because it built up a lot of tension, a lot of mystery, a lot of suspense, and I assumed that eventually the film would kick into high gear; it never did. The pace remains constant throughout the entire run time of this movie. It's excruciatingly slow. The movie is almost 3 hours long, and it feels like 6. I couldn't wait for this movie to end, I mean by the end of the movie I expected to look in the mirror and see that I aged 65 years. And also, the film is also overly convoluted. I'm not saying that this is a confusing film, because it's not; in fact, it's pretty straightforward and easy to follow. It just simply felt like this movie was convoluted for the sake of it being convoluted. At the time of watching everything felt important. I had to pee so badly the entire movie but I didn't want to get up because I felt like everything I was watching was super important. However, only after viewing do I realize that there were so many scenes that were totally unnecessary, that were there only to make the movie longer, more bloated, and more self-important.Unfortunately, there's just not much else to say. This is a simple movie, and it gets a simple review. Look, I wanted to give this a high score, but I just couldn't, and I don't understand why other people are because this movie is simply not enjoyable or entertaining. Yes, it's well made, a feast for the eyes and ears, but that doesn't make it a good film; it makes it a well directed and produced film, but not a good one."
101," A replicant of the first Blade Runner
","After seeing the the sequel to the amazing and amazing first Blade Runner, i am not disappointed. But i am not impressed either. In summary, 2049 plays it's cards too close to the chest, but without the element of surprise or good main characters to back it up. So lets break this movie down shall we? Sound: 3/10 The sound is perfectly mixed.... and that's that. Otherwise it's like the new Doom soundtrack, just a bunch of bass rumbling around on top of old Vangelis lines(but probably without the vintage hardware). A few of the tracks are Psybient/Solar Fields like, which really fit into the scenes. But overall, its pretty uninspiring. Visuals: 7/10 The sets are amazing, but there is definitely something off. The first movie had some sets that were really realistic, which is what i think made the movie believable. There was dirt, glass, patches of color, mats, live candles. It is the same as the visual difference between Alien/Aliens and Prometheus, if that makes any sense. It is obvious that they tried to replicate the set pieces of the original, but it comes off as way, way to grandiose and large-scale. Pacing: 2/10 Horrible. Every scene is dragged out so long that you could walk out, cook some food and come back without missing a single important thing in the story. Sure, the first Blade Runner was slow, but it wasn't moving like a drugged sloth. To sum it up, they could have easily pushed the story into an hour long movie instead of three. Story: 4/10 This is really where they dropped the ball. The characters are so boring they might as well be extras, especially Deckers girlfriend. I didn't care about her at the start, and i didn't care about her when she died. Also, the main villain. I mean, really? What were they thinking? She is so one-dimensional, she might as well be played by Brian Thompson. And no, making her cry while she kills things does not make her more complex and believable. The villain in the first Blade Runner, played by Rutger Hauer, at least had a glowing personality. Also, some scenes and ideas are just there for shock value. You will know which ones they are. In summary: There is not one line or scene in the whole movie which is even close to the quality of the monologue at the end of the first movie."

103," Glorious Art
","OK let me start by saying this: its not just any movie, its pure art! Cinematography is out of this world. Sound effects are like nothing i ever heard in my life. Soundtrack is reminiscent of original Blade Runner. Sensational acting from the new actors like Sylvia Hoeks ,Ana de Armas. all in all if there would be one word to describe this movie : PERFECTION ."
104," Your memories of the past are real?
","How iconic was the first ""Blade Runner"", how many creators it inspired to create new films in the science fiction genre, how many things it predicted, what philosophical thoughts it was conveying. Many fans of the first film expected to see something similar, but Denis Villeneuve introduced us his view of the universe, while retaining the spirit of the first film.Story. The creators of the film made every effort to keep the story in secret, and this was not done in vain. In order not to reveal the essence of the story, I just want to say that this is a story about how one way or another, everyone considers himself to be special. Director. Denis Villeneuve also brought us a lot of things that humanity is realizing in the near future. In most of his films Villeneuve touches on the theme of children, in this film he also devoted much time to the theme of parents and children. In fact, as some critics noted, the picture is very similar to Tarkovsky's work, the meditative narrative of the film allows us to reflect on philosophical questions: are all our memories real and is man really a supreme being?Music and visual effects. Despite the fact that there were two outstanding composers working on the film (Benjamin Wallfisch and Hans Zimmer), the music in the film is quite small and it is not remembered. Basically, all the compositions are very similar to each other and create an exceptionally tense atmosphere. A small amount of original music in the film partially compensates for the appearance in the film songs by Frank Sinatra and Elvis Presley. Unlike music, the film strikes a visual component. The film implements completely new creative design ideas, thanks to which you experience a real visual pleasure.The Result. In the end, we can say that Villeneuve did not turn ""Blade Runner 2049"" into another remake movies, the main task of which is to tell the same story with modern shooting technologies to attract a new audience and sell toys. After watching the film i have a strong desire to see it again on the big screen.9 out of 10"
105," ""I have seen things you people wouldn't believe...""
","Film is a medium that gets better with age. As a still picture is a form of reflection upon memory, a moving picture is a time capsule as well. While some shine only shortly within their moments of popularity, others grow in that popularity over the years even if they didn't have it upon first release. This circumstance is usually where the word ""classic"" tends to appear. While the term is usually revered in the filmmaking community, it often seems to scare critics. When age is usually a necessity in determining a classic it becomes difficult for a person who reviews the latest movies to use the term when describing something current. A fear of jumping the gun, and a fear I don't have. Blade Runner 2049 is a new classic. It will inspire countless young filmmakers as well as dazzle and delight fans of the original and those who have never seen it. I do not dare spoil this film. The plot is so well crafted and none of the points are forced upon the audience. It treats the viewer with respect and let's the audience put pieces together on their own. This is not to say that it is predictable. I think the biggest compliment I can give this film is that I didn't know where it was going. I was invested in the main characters struggles and that is mostly due to Ryan Gosling's superb performance. A performance that could not have been easy but because of that has now become my favorite of his. The amount of emotions he has to display through every scene is staggering and he pulls it off unbelievably. Aside from Gosling's performance we also have the star of the original Blade Runner; Harrison Ford returning as Rick Deckard. I have been a huge fan of Ford's career since I was a child and with that in mind I have to bring to light a fact that isn't easy to admit. Although he's great in the original as the disgruntled cop who learns to empathize with machines, he is very subtle with his emotions and doesn't often get into the really heavy, feely moments of a film. I am utterly amazed that this film brought out the sadness and pain in this character. Harrison Ford does things you never see him do here. I think it might be one of the best performances of his entire career. I often wonder where the new legends are. Spielberg, Kubrick, Scorsese, all the filmmaking giants that made their waves rise high above the heads of the industry and crash down with hit after hit and classic after classic. It appeared to me before I entered the theater that I had missed out on that era. Not to say that there aren't masters still out there today but they're just so hard to find. I now know that when the name ""Denis Villeneuve"" appears in the credits of a work, I will be blown away. Every film he has made thus far has been of exceptional quality and without a doubt, this is his finest work to date. I feel that he understood what made the original so revered, took it's DNA and crafted the finest specimen that he possibly could. There is another name that I must mention that I hope will soon become a household name just as the other legends that I mentioned previous. The man whose eye for angles and light have become legend to me. This man is Roger Deakins. Remember his name. This is just another passage in the great story that he's telling with his images. The world that has been created here feels so real, so lived in. The original gave us a glimpse into a future where machines were beginning to become more human than human, this film widens the keyhole and shows us the world where that is a full reality. And while I sat back in that IMAX theater, gazing at Deakins' vivid paintings, my ears were sucked in by the amazing soundtrack composed by Benjamin Wallfisch and Hans Zimmer. The synth sounds delighted and excited me. The most intense moments of the film were given that much more life by the music that drove them. What I find to be the greatest thing about this new masterpiece is that, I had so little expectations for it. I walked through those doors with an indifference inside me. Why make a sequel to a film that relied on thought provoking questions that were never answered? A sequel exists to expand on the first, so will it ruin all of the best aspects of the first? What could this film possibly bring? I was so wrong. The questions that existed before are still there as well as new ones that still have me thinking even as I write this now. I can analyze this film for years just as so many have the original. I know that this film won't be loved by all. The runtime will most likely be too long for the average blockbuster viewer, the complex ideals presented will annoy those who came for action, the pace will most likely completely bore them. But I feel those that do have these problems will come to realize something as well...that's exactly what people thought of the original when it was released. Now it is a classic. When I got in my car and proceeded along the dark road to my home, I sat in silence as my mind raced faster than my vehicle could take me. Of all the things that I didn't expect, I certainly didn't expect to see one of the greatest films I've ever viewed in the year 2017. Film truly is an amazing medium. And as I pulled into my driveway and killed the engine, I fretted over the biggest question that I had that evening, a question that still haunts me now¬ÖIs it better than the original?"
106," MARRY ME ANA
",Ana De Armas is the most beautiful creature to ever exist on this planet. FACT!!!
107," ""Dying for the right cause is the most human thing we can do.""
","Watching ""Blade Runner 2049"" makes me want to go back and see the original film again. In some ways I thought this was the better movie, and I know I'm probably causing a rumble with that statement. But there was a lot of nuance built into the story of the long out of action Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford), and it's a credit to the writers and film makers that his identity as a human or a replicant was kept ambiguous for this story. My gut tells me he's human, but then again, if Rachael (Sean Young) was a replicant, then how does that work with the concept of a live birth as the central mystery of the story? So yes, many questions, very few answers.One thing is certain, if the movie hadn't gotten the Oscar for Best Achievement in Visual Effects, then they might as well have just hung up the award. The CGI was outstanding and some of the concepts that got play were stunning, as in the character of K's (Ryan Gosling) holographic girlfriend Joi (Ana de Armas). That's not to say there weren't some inconsistencies in the story line. For example, K's status as a new line replicant designed to obey didn't exactly match up with his actions throughout the picture, and I wasn't persuaded that an eventual discovery of a replicant offspring would be all that catastrophic as advanced by Lieutenant Joshi (Robin Wright). Taking things in stride, those matters didn't prove to be a big deal but they were somewhat distracting.So over all, I thought the film was masterfully done with exceptional cinematography and dazzling effects. I'd like to special mention those hologram images of Elvis Presley and Marilyn Monroe as being well done, but the Frank Sinatra sequence was a sure bet, as the song he was singing brought me all the way back to a 1948 picture called ""Road House"" with Ida Lupino and Richard Widmark. He could have been crooning about this film when he sang ""Make it one for my baby, and one more for the road""."
108," A true masterpiece of a sequel for lovers or the original movie
","Denis Villeneuve's Blade Runner 2049 is probably the best sequel to a movie that I have ever seen, & it's on a par ( if not better ), then the original movie.Not to say thought, that this movie will appeal to all, as the original Blade Runner movie was a big flop at the box office when it was originally released, as it was way before it's time, & proved to be a little too deep & slow paced for the audiences of the mid 1980's, & it's only reached cult status as the years have rolled by, when si-fi fans begun to appreciate it for what it was, & that is a magnificent work of art.Just like the originally, the visuals in this movie are stunning, but more so, thanks to Roger Deakins magnificent cinematography, & the soundtrack, that has been written by legendary composer Hans Zimmer & Benjamin Wallfisch, also sticks close to vangelis's masterful soundtrack to the original movie, & is a feast for the ears.I also have to add that ( in my opinion ), Harrison Ford also gives a career best performance in this movie, & Ryan Gosling also gives a strong & touching performance, & there's strong support from all of the other main cast members also. Most notably Sylvia Hoeks who seems to command the screen whenever she appears on it.Just like the original Blade Runner movie, Blade Runner 2049 is a movie that leaves the audience with some tantalising unanswered questions, & just like the original movie, it's a movie that will stick in your mind for a very long time after viewing, if not for years to come, just like the original movie. However, as I have already said, this movie will not be for all, as for all it's strengths, some will still find it a little slow paced ( just like it's predecessor ), especially at nearly 3 hours long. However, Blade Runner 2049 ( just like it's predecessor ), is an art movie, & is meant to be savoured as such, & is not one of these fast paced action flicks that they turn out by the bucket load.To sum up, Blade Runner 2049 ( just like it's predecessor ), is true work of art, & a magnificent achievement."
109," A Visual Triumph
","I lived in fear of this film since it was announced¬Ö having loved the original, a sequel was always going to be a risky prospect. But my fears were slightly quelled when I learned that Denis Villeneuve (""Arrival"") was at the helm. And having now seen it I am pleasantly relieved: this is a memorable film. In 2049 the first-generation Nexus replicants of the original film are still causing problems, and Ryan Gosling is 'K' ‚Äì a blade runner employed by LAPD lieutenant Joshi (Robin Wright, ""Wonder Woman"", ""House of Cards"") to track them down and liquidate them. On one of these missions, K uncovers a buried secret that brings the LAPD into a desperate race for a pivotal prize, against replicant-builder Niander Wallace (Jared Leto, ""Dallas Buyer's Club"") and his henchwoman Luv (Sylvia Hoeks). The mission leads to K searching out his illustrious predecessor Deckard (Harrison Ford), who is not keen to be found.Firstly (and most impressively) this is a spectacle to watch¬Ö. ""I've seen things¬Ö""! The visuals are just gorgeous, from the junk-yards of Greater Los Angeles to the radioactive ruins of Las Vegas, vividly glowing amber to glorious effect. Hardly a surprise with Roger Deakins (""Hail Caesar"", ""Sicario"") behind the camera, but Adam Heinis (""Rogue One"") and the rest of his special effects team deserve kudos for the effects never feeling overly ""CGI-like"".The music (by Benjamin Wallfisch and Hans Zimmer, via a replaced Johann Johannsson) pays suitable tribute to the spirit of the original Vangelis soundtrack. (It's curious though that ""Tears in the Rain"" from the soundtrack is a reworking of the Vangelis original, but Vangelis doesn't seem to be credited anywhere! Vangelis and Ridley Scott clearly had a SERIOUS falling out!). On the acting front, Ryan Gosling is his dynamic self as usual! (But here, somewhat justified). Harrison Ford is given very little screen time, but what he does do he does exceptionally well ‚Äì his best performance in years. It's some of the supporting parts though that really appeal: Dave Bautista (""Spectre"") is just superb in the opening scenes of the film, and I particularly enjoyed Ana de Armas's portrayal of K's holographic girlfriend Joi. I've seen comment in other reviews that described this relationship as ""laughable"" and a downward step for ""woman's rights"" compared to Villeneuve's previous strong female characters (of Louise from ""Arrival"" and Kate from ""Sicario""). But I disagree! I found the relationship truly touching, with Joi's procurement of a prostitute (Mackenzie Davis) to act as a surrogate body being both loving and giving. And as regards 'woman's rights', come on! Get serious! This is a holographic commercial male companion¬Ö. the ""Alexa"" of the future¬Ö. I'm quite sure the male version looks like Ryan Reynolds! Sex still sells even in 2049!! My favourite character though was a cameo by Barkhad Abdi (""Captain Phillips"") luxuriating under the name of Doctor Badger!I was less comfortable with Jared Leto's dialogue which ‚Äì for me at least was barely audible. In general this film is both a challenge for those aurally challenged (with some fuzzy dialogue/effects/music mixes) and those visually challenged (with 8 point font for the on-screen text that was almost impossible to see on the cinema screen, so good luck with the DVD!).I really wanted to give this film 10 stars. But I can't quite get there. The story ‚Äì while interesting and having emotional depth ‚Äì is lightweight for a film of this length (a butt-numbing 163 minutes!) and it moves at such a glacial pace that I'm ashamed to say that my mind wandered at times. The screenplay was by Hampton Fancher (one of the original Blade Runner writers) and Michael Green (""Logan"", ""Alien: Covenant"") but even with this track record, the it's the film's Achilles heel. It's a relief that Blade Runner revisited is not a complete disaster: quite the opposite in fact. It doesn't quite match C-beams glittering in the dark near the Tannh√§user Gate (what could)¬Ö but its a damned good attempt.(Please visit bob-the-movie-man.com for the full and graphical version of this review. Thanks.)"
110," A Modern Masterpiece that will (hopefully) have the same reputation as the original
","Having heard all the positive reviews and comments, I already had high hopes. It even managed to exceed those!!!K, the new Blade Runner, is what Harrison Ford was in the original. However stories from the first film find themselves playing a key role in the new one as the two interlink faultlessly.Ryan Gosling plays the character brilliantly. With such a diverse acting resume spanning from Comedies (Crazy, Stupid Love) to Action (Drive), There is no doubt about it he is a talented actor. Acting alongside Ford brings another big action to his growing A list blockbusters.Ford's talent is natural here, adapting into the character he played all those years ago and bringing it to modern day. An actor who doesn't show his age when he runs and gets beaten around!As for the supporting cast, K's love interest Jon (played by the beautiful Ana De Armas) bought an element of necessary romance to the film, carrying and helping our main protagonist along. Sylvia Hoeks, who plays the 'Replicant gone rogue' Luv, brings the majority of the films violence with her. Other stars including Robin Wright as the Lieutenant giving orders to K and Dave Bautista as Sapper providing a famous supporting cast.The visuals here are second to none! From the vast deserts of a 'post-apocalypse' Vegas to the futuristic neo-noir rendition of California, everything is built for purpose. Nothing comes across as a pointless fill in. Everywhere we go, we're pulled along every step of K's journey. When he is isolated, we as an audience feel isolated with him. When courageous, we are pushed to the edge of our seats. It really sets out to give the audience every emotion in the book and, in my mind, I almost found myself wanting to be part of that world (almost)!The score from Zimmer and Wallfisch juxtaposed incredibly here, just as it did for Dunkirk. However I feel that they have gone a level up here and to bring such emotion to individual notes pushes me to confess that it is the best score I've heard yet!OK, I know, lots of positives. No such thing as a perfect film (although this comes so damn close)! I have to admit I wasn't all convinced by Jared Leto's role. His character seemed cool and, as you'll notice, he has a pivotal role in the new era of Replicants. I just thought his character didn't have as significant a role in the film as it needed.I don't want to spoil the plot but so much is happening here that I'd rather you just watch it for yourself. Conclusions are made to questions from the original, however questions that are left felt intentional to bring audience to debate.To sum the whole lot up, it was an honour to spend 2 hours and 44 minutes in this amazing world created by all the cast members. Do I want a sequel? No. This is a film with a beginning, middle and end. Lets keep it that way. Dennis Villeneuve I applaud you for taking the brave step in making this film and pulling it off in such style!!!"
111," A simple deep complex poetic masterpiece
","Blade Runner 2049 does a perfect job of expanding on the brilliantly sewn seeds that were planted in the original 1982 Blade Runner. Before watching it we recommend you revisit the first and even read analysis online to get into the juicy juice. Blade Runner 2049 was made for those who are familiar with the story line and is a sci-fi monument and masterpiece. We predict it will win many Oscars ‚Äî starting with best-adapted screenplay to Hampton Fancher. To supplement the original film Dennis Villeneuve had the following trio of short films to expand on the exposition. They are not necessary to view beforehand as we didn't see them until after.Blade Runner 2048: Nowhere to Run Blade Runner 2036: Nexus Dawn Blade Runner 2022: The Black OutThroughout the film there are numerous references to ""the black out"" ‚Äî an event which saw the world live in darkness for 10 days and the destruction of any data which wasn't written down on paper. That means bank records, identification documents, even digital baby photos were all lost effectively resetting the world. The implications of such an event are obvious, but what I want to know is, what caused it? Was it an accident? Did somebody bring it about on purpose to hide something?The original Blade Runner ends with Deckard receiving an origami silver unicorn from Gaff with his voice-over ""too bad she wont live, but then again who does."". When Deckard mulled over the Rachel details he fantasized about a Unicorn. Keep in mind that a Unicorn is ""fake"" aka replicant. Moreover, keep in mind a unicorn without a horn would be a horse.Whatever you do ‚Äî forget about the reviews! One of the ones to stay away from is written by looser want-to-be and failed actor RICHARD LAWSON From Variety magazine. The following was a headline from another article he wrote: ""Who Is America's Most Envied Kardashian-Jenner? We finally have an answer to this most serious of questions."" Well Richard, go back to your social media and most serious questions with the Kardashians.STOP READING THIS AND ALL OTHER REVIEWS AND GO AND SEE IT FOR YOURSELF!"
112," Intriguing and engaging
","It is 2049, 30 years after the events of the previous movie. K is a Blade Runner, a policeman who tracks down and terminates replicants (androids) whose model are viewed dangerous to society. K is himself a replicant, but has been programmed to be beneficial to society. One day he tracks down and terminates a replicant that has managed to evade detection and capture for over 28 years. In his garden are found the remains of a female replicant. Shockingly, the woman died during childbirth and the baby appears to have survived. Replicants cannot reproduce. If word gets out that they can, the human-replicant hierarchy will forever be disturbed. K must find the child, quickly. Also after it is Niander Wallace, a billionaire whose company makes replicants and whose main interest is in changing the world order.An intriguing and engaging movie, directed by Denis Villeneuve (Prisoners, Incendies, Sicario, Arrival) and co-written by Hampton Francher, who co-wrote the screenplay for the original Blade Runner. Good plot with some great twists and turns. Some clever manipulation of the viewer too, as you are funneled down one way of thinking, only to have things turn out in another direction. This unpredictability, and requirement that you use your brain, makes for some intriguing viewing.Great special effects, without being too show-offy and gratuitous. Great action scenes too.While I have seen the original Blade Runner (in all three forms), you don't have to have seen it in order to enjoy, or even understand, this one. It works fine as a standalone movie.Solid performances by all involved.On the negative side, the plot is not entirely water-tight. There are a few key moments where things take a turn for the implausible and contrived. The end result ultimately justified these turns, making me less critical of them, but the writers could easily have developed the plot around those moments more, in order to make them less loose and clumsy.Though I thought it was going to be, the running time of 163 minutes is not an issue. The movie never drags and the time just flies by. Great movie - certainly not your average sequel."
113," 2049: Do androids (still) dream of electric sheep?
","After a 30 years gap, this continuation answers almost all the questions remaining at the end of the first episode (you'd better watch it before or read a good abstract in order to understand...), but it opens even deeper existential interrogations! Compared to 1982, it introduces some newer technologies (drones, holograms, augmented reality) and suggests some present themes (racism {against androids}, gender and clothing issues, human food {from insects}, bees dying, possible loss of digital memories {total blackout}). It uses some audio archives and a short sequence from the original footage, which allows a key character to make an incredible come back! But this VFX integration is rather elegant, at least in the 2D version. In short: Not a remake nor just a tribute, but an interesting follow-up!"

Being a fan of the first one made me love the first two acts, and cringe a little at the third act, although, it certainly didn't ruin the movie for me, there were just a few things that kept the film being an absolute sequel masterpiece (Godfather 2, Aliens, Terminator 2, Mad Max Fury Road, etc.), that said, it comes pretty close, and who knows, I could change my mind after a few more viewings.Beware if you want to blank slate the movie, but read on if you've read most other reviews and synopses, or even just watched the trailers. But I'll start off with my complaints, so pretty much once Deckard entered the story, things started to go sour for me. First of all, the magic nostalgia is kind of ruined by the fact that this is Harrison Ford's third role reprisal, and the other two, lovable as they are, are comparatively silly. Deckard is a very, serious and dark character, to put it lightly, he and Rachael do not have a Han and Leigha romantic relationship, it's a very hard boiled noir type affair, let's just say Rachael never seems to happy, or even consenting, about the whole thing most of the time. They both have a lot going on. But in 2049, Harrison Ford reminisces about love and such, and seems more like Han Solo or Indiana Jones than Deckard, maybe that's just from the overshadowing of those two other characters. But it's just kind of weird, yes, Deckard and Rachael do run off at the end of the original, but the film is so dark, I doubt too much sweetness occurred, but who knows? They could have had a passionate year or so after.Also, the last climatic scene does not have the emotional punch of the original, also the presence of Harison Ford does not help. And lastly, the last scene is powerful, but very Arrival, and just kind of out of place, sort of like Harrison Ford actually. It's like if Mel Gibson was haniging out in Fury Road.That said, the rest of the film is amazing! Visually it replicates and improves upon the the aesthetic of the original. I very much like the way the story mirrors the noir mystery story line and pacing of the first, perhaps that's why the nostalgic last emotional hour seems a little out of place. Also, it was extremely refreshing to watch shots that were longer than seven seconds, to just let the world, and even the interiors, immerse you. The connection to the first are actually very clever, and Gosling's K's involvement in the whole thing is a nice nod to the vagueness of the original film. Contrary to many reviews and general rumor, the mysteries of the first are preserved. K's holographic HER girlfriend is a nice element, and a welcomed contrast to the original. Ana DE Armas turns what could have been just another empty character into the most fleshed out character of the film. Robin Wright, in a similar role as in Wonder Woman, is fun to watch as a great sergeant character.In summary, all in all, two hours of an absolute masterpiece, with a final act that is, well, a movie, but still a good movie, despite the minor complaints, hence the 9 rating, it was almost there. Did I mention Wonder Woman?"

Sure guys I agree the girlfriend had a nice body and could satisfy me."
116," Standing in the shadow of giants.
","I broke a taboo and went to see the Film Which Shouldn't Have Been Made, aka Blade Runner 2049. And regretted it.Not quite sure which bit was the worst, so I'll start from the good ones. CGI was the biggest player and reaching levels never seen before. Rachael gave me, indeed, the goose bumps. Photography was gorgeous but in many ways not comparable to the original. The 2049 version of Pris was as good as the original, and not because of CGI, which is nice. The BR1-way of nice, which had no CGI.Lots of juicy bits to take us for a wonderful trip down memory lane, but all these great bits seem to have been scripted to make a replica(-nt) of the original film. They are not hidden somewhere to let the audience spot them and delight with their discovery. Beside the cameos played by the original actors, the numerous references to the first film are a substantial part of the footage. They are not nuanced, they are slapped in the face of the public in inescapable order: car zooming over LA (check), Pris (check), origami (check), exotic animal dealer in seedy district (double check), PanAm (check), Coca-Cola billboards (check), Atari ads (check). And the list goes on.With that out of the way, let's face it, if it hadn't be for the CGI, the cameos and the plagiarism, the film had very little to offer. The soundtrack was horrid; bombastic, droning and uninspired much like Hans Zimmer's previous stuff. The repeating nods to the original soundtrack were coarse and, at the same time, they made his almost bearable. No stupid voice over of the very first BR theatrical version, but a big fat explanation right in the middle of the film, by a one-eyed replicant, in a scene that made me expect Tina Turner appear in leather clothes. Beside the gratuitous explanation, the plot is not as linear as one might expect, but it seems that all the ideas and influences have been, sort of, stitched in a hurry, cramming as much stuff as possible in a film that was already too long.The influence of ""Her"" (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1798709) is evident, but while Her had all the time to develop the psychological drama, in BR2049 the same ideas are badly developed, and CGI gets massively in the way, distracting from the drama.The first BR blurred the boundaries of good and evil, as much as human and artificial. In BR2049 we have the reappearance of the super villain, much like in a Marvel flick. All the good old stereotypes of Hollywood film making are back, and one is to wonder why the cavalry didn't make it for the gran finale.There are also good reasons to dislike the closing scene, which lets the audience leave the theatre with nothing to remember beside the special effects. The film should have ended right on that staircase and let us sink deep in K's existential agony. Which is amplified by its similarities to ours. But no, the scene, which is a bad copy of Roy's death (check), underlined by the same music (check), but not nearly the same pathos, is whisked aside in a hurry, and the happy ending cuts in. OK, Gosling is no Rutger Hauer, but his character had the same potential. Why did his death need to look so unimportant? BR1 led us to question what should be considered human and what is not; it shook our certainties. BR2049 seems to put that boundary firmly back in place: if you are not born, your feelings are just a delusional dream; you are a machine. Period.Given the profusion of prequels, trailers and whatnot, we had to endure, it is only to be expected a string of director's cuts. While the first Blade Runner had a history that unfolded throughout its several editions, due to its initial misunderstanding and its later rise to cult status, the repackaging of this one has probably been planned upfront, as a way to stand firmly in the shadow of the original film.While Blade Runner inspired generations, I won't be surprised if its sequel will soon be forgotten. As already written by someone else, Blade Runner 2049 looks like a flawed replicant and the only feeling you will be left with is a sense of regret for having wasted three hours of your life."

STUPID.
This film is boring.
This film is not needed.
This film does not have a story.
This film's ending is just an invitation to a sequel.
Yeah, NOTHING HAPPENS in this movie.As for all the people who praise the women. Yeah, i understand. hollywood has made 'art' of putting unattractive females in films and when ONE movie comes out with a pretty chick it all becomes 10/10 because we are all so desperate.No, this film was bad. STOP SUPPORTING SEQUELS."
118," Enjoy the ride
","I've never bothered to write a review and this is less a review than just a note about some of the misgivings from a number of other reviews. In the negative reviews run time has been noted as a major factor for poor marks. Let me just make this clear, this movie gets the run time it respectfully deserves. Not only a movie but a journey into another world that may not be so distant, it is stunning and brilliant. One thing i absolutely love in sci fi movies, games and TV shows is quality sound effects and music and this is the best i have heard. A must see at the cinema to experience that sound, and then those visuals on the big screen, truly breathtaking. Back to the run time yes 90 minutes is fine for a comedy or basic action movie but for a masterpiece like this to come in under 140 minutes would not do it justice. Enjoy the ride, if you cant handle a true cinematic experience stick to the sitcoms."

","This movie was so bad I can't put into words. I loved Blade Runner but this sequel is so bad I can no longer watch the original. Music over the top Acting nonexistent Length, felt like 6 hours,and not in a good wayAs people left the theater I saw shaking heads.Don't understand people raving about it. They must be connected to the film somehow. Save your money, watch the original and don't let this ruin it for you like it did for me"
120," A superior sequel that stands on its own.
","The original Blade Runner I have more respect then fondness for. Similar to Ridley Scott's latter philosophical sci-fi film Prometheus, I admire the movie's ideas, themes and world-building but as a story I don't really care for. Where as the original asked lots of questions about human identity, Denis Villeneuve's sequel explores the answers posed by those questions in very emotional and psychological ways. The answers may not be ones you would expect but show how the famous question, ""what does it mean to be human"" is one not defined by our own creation or sense of destiny. He takes the many common sci fi plot tropes in many blockbusters and constantly turns them on their head. Similar to his previous film Arrival, Villenneuve uses the themes of memories to act as the driving force of the narrative. Unlike the original, 2049 feels fleshed out with compelling characters and multiple unique locations. It goes beyond just futuristic LA, which has gotten even bigger and more hi-tech to reflect how technology today has evolved since the release of Ridley Scott's film 30 years ago. The events and actions of the story are defined more by the impact of character's choices rather then the characters going along with the events. Despite having a longer run time then the first, 2049 feels like it moves at a better pace because more is happening then just a simple detective story. But Villenueve doesn't get lost in the plot of the mystery. He makes this story feel personal by following the blade runner K's journey as a character.There have been a lot of sci fi masterpieces with stunning visuals but I would say Roger Deakins kept stealing the show with the best cinematography I have ever seen. Nothing against the directing, writing and performances but the shot compositions kept me constantly in awe and distraction in an almost hypnotic ways. Not only are the shots and lighting atmospheric but they also feel almost like a character itself as they change to reflect the mood and tension of the scene. And they fit perfectly with the Vangellis-inspired score by Han Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch that makes you feel you are transported to that world.Gosling shows that he is perfectly suited to Villeneuve's style. Similar to Drive, Gosling's performance is very much quite and subtle. His character K does not say much as he does not feel the need to speak his own voice to question or challenge his way of life. But once he is put onto a mission that questions how his world actually worked, his quest becomes one of self-discovery. This leads to his journey intersecting with Deckard's. One of the issues I have with Blade Runner is the fact that Deckard is not really a character that you can connect with or feel sympathy for. One of the biggest improvements 2049 does is giving Deckard a tragic backstory. After a lot of build up to meeting Deckard again, it doesn't disappoint. Ford shows a more broken and human side of Deckard that the original did not. We see his isolation is one not of choice but forced to protect the only really human connection he has in this bleak world. Other great performance are Ana De Armas, Sylvia Hoeks, Robin Wright and especially Dave Bautista who has the least screen-time but probably gives the best performance of his acting career. The one performance I thought lacked subtly was Jared Leto's philosophical antagonist Niander Wallace. His character had some compelling traits but I felt the least connected to.While there have been a lot of genre classics revitalized to capitalize on nostalgia, Blade Runner 2049 does not feel like one that is forced to make you remember the past. Instead Villeneuve uses the original's story as way to tell his own story about choice vs destiny. By the end of this movie, you feel like it has been a satisfying conclusion to what the original Blade Runner started as opposed to being a setup for another franchise or cinematic universe. While many die-hard fans will argue about this, 2049 surpasses the first Blade Runner by giving a resolution instead of leaving it open with another question."
121," Beyond Blade Runner
","I'm a huge fan of the original 1982 Blade Runner, and as a rule, an even bigger fan of Ridley Scott. I admit I was a bit disappointed when I heard that Ridley Scott's role in Blade Runner 2049 was consigned to Executive Producer with Denis Villeneuve taking the helm. I have nothing against Villeneuve, and I quite enjoyed Arrival, my only prior experience with his films (No, I haven't gotten around to Sicario, yet). My disappointment was probably rooted in my emotional connection to the original, and my fear that no one would honor its core like Scott would. Following the opening sequence, my concerns were allayed. I won't add to the fray as to whether 1982's Blade Runner needed a sequel, but in the age of sequels and reboots representing lack of original thought, Blade Runner 2049 continues the story and expounds upon it with a complexity I never expected. All this is done while still honoring the moral implications, imagery, symbolism, and overall genetic imprint of the original. Frankly, I'm not sure Scott could have made a film like this, but it couldn't have been made without his influence.Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch's brooding, yet sometimes startlingly percussive soundtrack appropriately echoed necessary themes from Vangelis' futuristic original while expanding to a complexity deserving of the film. Additionally, while the original soundtrack can be replayed and enjoyed absent from its intended medium, 2049 is so tightly woven into the sound effects, I doubt it will have that same replay-ability. The electronic and artificial nature establishes the brutish impact of the human element on the planet almost before the imagery does. A genius move is the unsettling use of a brief, but recognizable excerpt from Sergey Prokofiev's Peter and the Wolf. Its having been relegated to little more than an advertising jingle or ringtone. Fragmented performances by Sinatra and Elvis are equally unsettling and alien amidst the dystopian landscape that is clearly a broken Earth.The performances from the ensemble were at the level I expect in a film of this caliber. While no single actor stole the show, there were a few surprises. For one, I had no idea Dave Bautista had this range. While his screen time is brief, it's impactful and effective. Ryan Gosling typically stars in films outside of my preferences, but his performance as a tortured soul trying to maintain his humanity was well done. I was pleased to see Harrison Ford's role being more than a trivial throwback. In lesser hands, playing the role of man who's seen and been through too much but still trying to hold it together, can easily come off as a crazy old coot. Ford made this role believable not as the Deckard from the original, but rather as someone he most certainly was destined to become. Robin Wright did an outstanding performance portraying a hardened cop tightly constrained by bureaucracy struggling to do the right thing---pride, defiance, and defeat moved across her visage in an uncanny fashion. Despite his fabled off-screen method acting antics, I suspect a large part of Jared Leto's performance was left unseen (pun intended). His presence was noteworthy but too brief. It may well have been truncated in the interest of time or possibly to add to the character's mystique. Sylvia Hoeks was unknown to me prior to this film, but I'm surprised I haven't seen more of her. She beautifully portrays a steely cold fa√ßade holding back a driven, trembling fury. Her character is likely be defined as the female equivalent of Rutger Hauer's ""Roy Batty"", but she's a bit more unhinged but focused all at the same time. Like other fans, I'd quietly hoped to see more of the original cast in some fashion, but that's why I'm not a screenwriter. As expected there were a couple of ""cameos"" that were unnecessary along with an ill-conceived special effects sorcery stunt that fell short, but nothing on the level of Rogue One's Tarkin and Leia.I saw this in IMAX presentation, and I'm glad I did. I'm usually drawn to IMAX presentations for the expansive imagery, and the 1.9:1 aspect ratio certainly contributed to the expansive nature of the film. However, the sound was an equal draw for me. I've already read about some complaints with respect to muddy dialogue in which the soundtrack seemed to drown out voices. To those I propose your issue is with your theater, as I noticed none of this at the AMC 14 in Tyler, TX. In fact, it's been quite some time since I've gone to a film in which the LFE (low-frequency effects) rattled my chest while I could still hear the male and female voices with exceptional clarity. One notable scene involves the viewer alternating between drowning in a body of water only to surface intermittently to the sound of pounding rain, gunfire and distressed voices---all of which was clear and effectively immersive. The question is who will enjoy this film. Formulaically speaking, a sequel's appeal to its original's fan base is probably largely related to its similarity to the same. In the case of Blade Runner 2049, it's not that simple. This will depend on what it is about 1982's Blade Runner that attracted you, and you may not even be able to define that. It is certainly possible to appreciate Blade Runner 2049 without having seen the original, but it will be a very different film for you. Even average sci-fi fans may take issue with the prolonged brooding and the 2 hr 44 min runtime, while others will bask in it and want more. Time will tell if Blade Runner 2049 endures like its predecessor. I will be viewing this at least once more in IMAX while it enjoys its theatrical run. Then I look forward to a proper home media release in which I fully anticipate a few Blade Runner marathons down the road."
122," So 35 years of wait is finally over... Was it worth the wait???
","This is my updated review as I feel I did not do the movie justice and I have also increased my score of the movie...
I was one of the lucky ones who got to see an early preview.... And the more that time passes by and the more the story of Blade Runner 2049 sinks in the more the gravity of the story hits me... First of all it really was not what I was expecting... I had watched many trailers and interviews and I feel like I had done quite a successful job in staying away from spoilers.... 
And....
Without spoiling it for anyone else and giving too much away.... Whatever you think you know about the film... well, forget it.... You're way off the mark... 
The best advice I can give though is however dark you think Blade Runner 2049 is.... It's darker than that.... It's much darker than the original... And the original was quite dark.... The cinematography is beautiful... it really is stunning... but the film itself.... did I mention it was dark??.. I think this is amplified (excuse the pun) by the movie's soundtrack... The work of Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch was for me... at times.... malevolent... And perhaps if the music wasn't so dark and hostile the movie itself wouldn't come across like that also... But then what do I know?... That's not to say the music is bad... It was for me.... like I said malevolent.... As for the movie itself... Again without giving too much away.... It's a story of loneliness.... A story of wanting nothing more than to be accepted... It's a story of desperate hope and anguish... Wanting for a better life.... Replicants being more human than humans, being more perfect than humans.... but not being human and wanting nothing more than to be human... even for all the faults the human race has and the perfection of the replicant race... Still the desperate hope and anguish of wanting to be human.... Are you keeping up??... And this whole time living in a dystopian world.... where the future of the human race is a lost cause and Mother Earth has never looked so heartbroken.... 
Speaking of heartbreak... again without spoiling the story... be prepared... the whole story is a story of heartbreak and literally at every turn Ryan Gosling is having his heart broken.... whether that be his relationships with others or his life in general... For me Ryan Gosling has a knack of playing the lonely leading role... and he has done this on a few occasions now.... both in the movies - ""Drive"" and ""Only God Forgives"".... which I hope he doesn't end up being typecast in... but saying that... I don't think there is an actor alive today who can play the role of being totally isolated from the rest of the world better than Ryan Gosling.
Blade Runner 2049 did have some nice surprises... which again... I won't spoil... 
In closing.... Ryan Gosling is excellent... It is Harrison Ford's best work for years.... This overall review may sound like I'm being negative about Blade Runner 2049... But I'm not... I'm really not...I should also mention the performances from the female leading acts in the show. Ana de Armas, Robin Wright and Sylvia Hoeks are all very, very good and each and every one of them. Including all the crew should be proud of such a beautiful sequel. As for where it stands next to the original... I never thought I'd hear myself saying this but I think as years pass by it will stand next to the original Blade Runner quite easily.... It's not the same movie as the original but it is as good as the original in its own right...
I think Ryan Gosling said it best in an interview
The film is incredible... it's.... haunting...
With this in mind a few days have passed now and I am still left with a feeling of being haunted by Blade Runner 2049.... 
So much so that I want to see it again and I will go and see it again... and again... and again....
Just like I did the original...
Blade Runner 2049 ""is"" incredible....
It's...
Haunting"
123," A long dazzling sci-fi sequel to a classic
","This film may be one of the longest I see this year at nearly two and a half hours. Films by Denis Villeneuve move at a slow steady pace with long shots. This sequel to the 80s cult classic is gorgeous and mesmerizing as it moves around various parts of this futuristic west from trash heaps in San Diego to the red desert of an abandoned Las Vegas. Los Angeles is constantly stormy or snowing as the detection takes place in drab buildings or on dark city streets. The film begins with text informing the viewer that in the thirty years since the original film the Tyrell corporation has become bankrupt and the Wallace corporation has taken over. Officer K (Ryan Gosling) is a new version of the blade runner but also a newer model replicant. He arrives at the house of Sapper Morton (Dave Bautista), a maggot farmer. He confronts him about his identity and the two fight until K finally kills Sapper with a pistol blast to the head. Before he leaves the site, his drone notices a strange box buried beneath a tree.K must go through tests to keep him at a baseline as they monitor the replicants more closely. Madam Lieutenant Joshi (Robin Wright) is K's superior officer. Other people know K is a ""skinjob"" and yell slurs at him or write them on his apartment door. He has a virtual woman for company, Joi (Ana de Armas). He brings home a new update that allows her to travel around but he's called back to the office before he gets to use it. The box beneath ground contained bones of a recently pregnant woman but K zooms in to find a serial number etched mysteriously on the bones. Lieutenant Joshi is disturbed by the revelation that replicants can reproduce and orders K to destroy the evidence. Tracking the serial number brings K to the Wallace corporation where he is met by the replicant Luv (Sylvia Hoeks). She identifies the number as belonging to Rachel and plays the recorder from the first film when Deckard (Harrison Ford) tested her. Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com"
124," Hair pulling torture
","I have not seen such a badly made movie in a really long time. The only thing good about this movie is the actors. who did a good job in doing what they were told to. But the story is a pathetic layering of a typical family drama projected onto flying cars that is supposed to be our future. The jest of story, we industrialize ruthlessly to shred nature and then struggle to find a human emotion within ourselves and wage a war to hold on to it. Pathetic, heard many times, over and over. I am not sure if the theme was disguised as to give a facade of art or was so poorly directed that it was not even strongly projected. Either way, it gave me headaches. And the music was so grossly out of sync with the picture, it made no sense remotely. The unnecessary loud noises had not 1% context with what was happening on screen. Ridiculously long, out of context, poor direction, senseless sound effects, sorry picture of the story. sheer torture to sit through it."
125," How Could Anyone Make Something This Good?
","Blade Runner 2049 is simply one of the best movies I've ever seen. This movies nails every key aspect of filmmaking from the direction, the performances, and the CINEMATOGRAPHY. Roger Deakins outdid himself in this film with some of the best shot in film I've ever seen. Ryan Gosling, as always, is fantastic, as well as Ane de Armas. You expect some to say that this movie was ""too boring"" or ""not enough action"" and I guess if you were expecting constant thrills, you could have been disappointed. And yes, this movie is LONG, running at almost 2 hours and 45 minutes, but there isn't a moment in this movie that felt unnecessary. However, this movie is amazing and you should see Blade Runner 2049 without a doubt.Blade Runner 2049 - 10/10"

",Watched it last night. We had high expectations from this movie based on the first one. It is so slow in the beginning that we already started to lose interest in the first half hour of play. We showed some understanding taking into consideration how long the movie was. My mates and I ended up sleeping sometime through the movie. This is the first time such thing has ever happened to us so you can understand how bad it was. The second half was a bit more interesting. Nothing more than dragging the plot and all those stupid unnecessary sounds woke us up every now and then. In overall it's a 163 minute masterpiece of crap.
127," A shining neon-glowing sequel.
","This review of Blade Runner 2049 is spoiler free ***** (5/5) WHEN RIDLEY SCOTT released the first Blade Runner back in 1982 it was unlike anything before it, it was essentially more than just a film with an impressively compelling performance from Harrison Ford, it was immediately noticed as a technological accomplishment filled to the brim with an impressive collection of special effects ‚Äì the moving holographic billboards were enough to make your eyes pop, the flying cars which now are more of a fantasy than a reality and a combination humans and robots called replicants. It really achieved higher than any other sci-fi before and even after the time ‚Äì which essentially is why today it goes down as a masterpiece and perhaps the best that cinema has ever been. However when French-Canadian director Denis Villeneuve announced that he was going to do a sequel long time fans were sceptical about it saying that it wouldn't be as good, it would give the predecessor a bad name and won't go down as well.Emphatically now at the long-awaited release of Blade Runner 2049 you can erase your fears as this is by far the best a sci-fi sequel has ever been. We open with Ryan Gosling's Officer KD6-3.7 a Blade Runner for the Los Angeles Police Department who's on a case to bring in any old replicants while on the case he unearths a long-buried secret that has the potential to plunge what's left of society into chaos which could destroy everything they have come to know. Set in a world where the Earth is left in anarchy after an event which shook the world and brought the people of the city into fear shattering previous memories everything is left empty seemingly without repair. The film erupts from the opening reel as Villeneuve drags you into the often lonely life of Gosling's policeman who tries everything to repair his life back to the way it was, his character is complex yet cleverly thought out thanks to a script penned by Hampton Fancher and co-writer Michael Green they give his character a simple story but he's emotional too dealing with feelings way beyond his thoughts. And for any of you La La Landers out there Gosling is on top of his game much like Ford's performance in the film's predecessor he's incredible and brings a powerful dynamic to his story and essentially the film would be nothing without him.As an experience it's a must see especially in IMAX ‚Äì it's loud ominous score quakes around the halls shattering your eardrums from the vibrations, the beautiful giant holographic billboards are enough to make your eyes pop just looking at the colour and the bright city lights and the sci-fi action is riveting and fast paced. Immediately after entering the live futuristic city of Los Angeles it's clear that Villeneuve is right at home here using the same directing techniques he's become accustomed with during Sicario, Prisoners or indeed Arrival using impressive close-ups, stunning long shots and eye-shattering panoramic shots. However at a runtime of 2 hours 43 minutes it's quite a long marathon that you will have to exercise for before stepping into the theatre yet that exercise is worth and is thoroughly paid off.Stylistically it is a Blade Runner film so for long-time fans the environment will be all too familiar and producer Scott who's happy to be back in this territory he makes every collection of images as real as possible bringing Villeneuve's imagination to life it really doesn't get any better than this. Happily when Ford's Rick Deckard comes onto the audience smiles from ear-to-ear. Story wise his character is a bit like Luke Skywalker from Star Wars: The Force Awakens he has been missing for thirty years and there is an extensive search for him. When found, Rick doesn't take to K at first he immediately thinks that K is trying to kill him. Here Ford now 75 years old looks a little worse for wear as if he's been lost aching for a little company which has been missing from his life and he brings this emotion into his character's grief giving him some emotional prowess which thanks to his stunning performance pays off.Happier still, the action is incredible there are only a few action scenes but each one is as brutal as the previous time round ‚Äì Villeneuve introduces the action scenes as a cinematic thespian adding momentum to the white knuckle punches and a deafening ping from the two characters' blasters which surprisingly look as good as new. The action is relentless, fast-paced and utterly riveting from a wide-eyed opening fight scene with Dave Bautista's Sapper Morton, through electric chase scenes to a brutal final fight scene they are compelling and Villeneuve lets them play their toll painting a shiny gloss to the end credits. What Villeneuve has created in Blade Runner 2049 is an impressive, compelling and brilliant sci-fi sequel that shines with a glossy finish and will still look good with multiple viewings and is an experience that will last for decades to come.VERDICT: An impressive exercise of stunning colour, immersive CG images and incredible techniques Villeneuve's sequel isn't just a movie, it's a technological accomplishment, and is by far this year's best film."
128," Excellent, Intellectual Science Fiction
","This is an amazing piece of work. It has incredible artistry. As a visual exercise, it is breathtaking. I thought the original was way ahead of its time in creating a milieu, a dystopian world, full of disease and commercialism. Given the wonders of modern times, the world where this takes place is nonpareil. Ryan Gosling is out to eliminate the old replicants because there is a secret which needs to kept. The hierarchy is doing what it can to keep a world event from eliminating the awful world they have created. Goslin has memories, but they could have been implanted in him, so he is continually torn by dealing with details that may or may not be true. He needs to return to the place of his childhood. Harrison Ford reprises his original role of Deckard, now old and living in the ruins of Las Vegas. Evil is in control, but there is hope. The final scenes are incredible and puzzling, but it is a great challenge to the viewer."
129," Did not ruin the image of Blade Runner - hardest thing to achieve
","Beautiful image, very good acting, good story with powerful symbolism and bad music. That sums up the movie. For excessive verbosity and self-important attitude you can read other reviews below. Stayed true to the original in many ways and that's important for fans of the original BR. Remember that the original BR had a pretty cold reception in the early 80s. Who knows how this one will be perceived a decade from now. And yes, I do miss Vangelis; the movie really came to life when they played pieces of his original music. Zimmer just didn't seem to understand the project.Those who complain that the movie is long and slow clearly have the attention span of a 5-year-old and should probably stick to Fast & Furious.Blade Runner 2049 could have been more but it could have been a lot less too. Thankfully enough it wasn't. I'm not ecstatic, but not disappointed at all and I realize that my expectations have been incredibly high. I will go see it a second time for sure.EDIT Oct 13 after seeing the movie a second time (in 3D). I'd like to upgrade my rating from 8 to 10 if y'all don't mind. Blade Runner 2049 is a 150-million-dollar gift to a small but dedicated fan group of the original movie. Thank you for that gift. I don't think there's any sequel in the history of cinema that stays true to the original to the point where even the tiniest details - noticeable only by hardcore fans who've watched BR 1982 thirty times - are being transplanted into this new film. And, no, BR 2049 did not make Blade Runner mainstream as some complain here. On the contrary, it kept its secrets open only to the same group of initiates, with the possibility of others from the younger generation to join, if they have what it takes. As many of the reviews below testify this movie still remains a mystery to most people out there, whose ability to digest abstract ideas is unfortunately very low."
130," You'll be blown away
","Remembering Ridley's masterpiece from 1982 coming into 2017 as new Blade Runner it had a potential that were in creation for 35 years and it was a magnificent picture that will shame even some of the best movies. Blade Runner 2049 tells a story of LAPD officer that is still picking up old Replicants and comes up to discovery of something greater. Words cant' describe feeling that Blade Runner constantly provides you with as it moves along expanding your understanding of Universe where it's placed. Director Denis Villeneuve (Sicario, Prisoners, Arrival) comes into this project as a refreshment and brings everything that is so special about his work into this movie with so powerful directing and bring's us to the edge. Alongside Roger Deakins as cinematographer with his ability to capture moments in such profound and beautiful way that will blow even hardest critiques away. Combination of them two and amazing screenplay that they were provided with created this new kind of movie that gives us new insight into film making and how good movies can be. From the start of year with such a great Logan that was dramatic enough to move us all but at the same time entertaining and now with this beautiful masterpiece that is Blade Runner 2049, movies started to adapt and evolve into a pictures that can in every moment be viewed as entertaining and imaginary as much as possible but with emotions and drama is just beautiful to watch. Without any doubt you may say that Blade Runner 2049 is the best movie of 2017 so far and there will be much trouble for movies to top this one. K/Joe (Ryan Gosling) was brought to play an amazing role and he gave an incredible performance proving himself to be a leading man that may lead to being one of the great actors of his class. Deckart (Harrison Ford) returned for his role and as usual he showed us that he can't be forgotten. As for music there is always Hans Zimmer with Benjamin Wallfisch that made a wonderful job in creating certain moods inside movie. You may say Blade Runner 2049 continues to be one of the movies that top it's predecessor and just take off into great universe that it may give. 4/4"
131," A very good sequel to a classic
","I am a big fan of Blade Runner and I was excited to see BR2049 but I didn't come into this sequel with too many high expectations, fearing to be let down. I love Denis Villeneuve's work with a passion and when I saw Arrival last year, I was very confident in what he could do with sci-fi. I must admit that from the first frame of BR2049, I was sold. The few callbacks to the original movie you can catch here and here were magnificent. The cinematography is absolutely insane. I saw it in IMAX and it was one of the most breathtaking visuals I've seen in a very long time. The lighting, the set designs, they all brought me back to the feelings I have when I watch the first movie. I've read that Villeneuve wanted most of the props and locations to feel real and thank god he did. Not only Roger Deakins's work is going to earn him a well deserved Oscar, he teams up perfectly with Villeneuve's style and they make magic together. As for the music, I like that it stands on its own, I didn't want them to copy the Vangelis score too much and they do just enough references. I think Ryan Gosling was the perfect leading man for K. Even when he must be cold and serious, I feel that he still keeps his charm and magnetism intact. Ana De Armas was a pleasant surprise, bringing a bit of sensitivity as Joi. I also liked the Luv character, played by Sylvia Hoeks, and Dave Bautista. And let's not forget Harrison Ford, who did a pretty good job playing Deckhard again. You must go into this movie as an experience, not watching a big blockbuster with big explosions all the time. You must know the first story to really enjoy it but you must also not compare it too much. It's a contemplative journey through dark cities, snow and ashy deserts. It's a movie that raises many questions but doesn't give all the answers. Just like the original, it's not perfect. I thought it was way too long and some scenes almost made me laugh because they were a bit ridiculous and predictable. But in the end, I strongly feel that Villeneuve won his bet and he proved without a doubt that he's one of the best directors of the last 20 years."
132," Spectacularly boring
","If you haven't seen the original, don't you'll wish you would have never watched this one.The remake has some of the best visuals I've seen in any movie, that does not make for a complete movie.Should have known from the IMDb (too high) of rating that there was something afoot. Turns out my senses was correct."
133," Holy mother of god.
","The girlfriend is eye candy and the film is useless.
No words will suffice. So, so bad. So cliche. So sequel-ish. So unoriginal and not just because it's a sequel. It does empower women to be attractive however which is against the trend of Hollywood."
134," Great Achievement
","I've seen over 1,000 movies in my life, and I'm in my early twenties. I've seen terrible films, good films, great films and then there are the few that are just truly great achievements in filmmaking. the score for this film is one of the best I've ever heard, it is visually stunning beyond anything, and the plot that makes this one of the greatest sequels of all time. you shouldn't really see this until you've seen the original, but either way, its doesn't matter. i left the theater speechless, and that's never happened before. yes its long, but get over it. people are too used to a lot of action in movies these days. go see it, that's all i can say."
135," A Masterpiece of the highest order
","First let me just say that I am not going to spoil any of the plot points of this movie as the director has himself insisted not to and I urge the reviewers to come to respect his wish.Now let me just start by saying the original Blade Runner was one of the most influential sci-fi film to be ever made. Some people may not like it as it is very slow paced and deeply philosophical and I respect their opinion but you cannot deny its legacy. As it so happens Blade Runner 2049 might just fall on the same category. Directed by Denis Villeneuve who directed Incedies, Prisoners(another masterpiece), Arrival, Sicario and Enemy has outdone himself. This is seriously his best film to date. Even though this is a sequel to a movie he wasn't involved in whatsoever he has managed to expand its universe extremely elegantly and marked his directorial trademark in it. I won be surprised if he is put in the same bracket as Kubrick, Spielberg, Tarantino, Scorsese, Eastwood in the coming years. Talking about greatness we have director of photography propelled by Roger Deakins who already had his hands on Shawshawnk Redemption, No Country for Old Men, Skyfall, The Big Lebowski and Fargo to just name a few and to think he has never won an Oscar despite being nominated 13 times. Well this is about to change this year or you cannot ever take Academy seriously because I strongly believe this is his best work. The way he uses color palette is quite remarkable to watch and it might just be one of the best looking film to ever exist. Acting wise Harrison Ford gives one of his performance in a long time. You can just feel he loved working on this film(unlike that reboot on 2015). I have always been a fan of Ryan Gosling since Drive(another Neo-Noir masterpiece) and after watching this I am convinced that he is one of the best actor working today. Jared Leto gives a another stellar performance as expected from an Academy winner. Dave Bautista, Robin Wright, Ana de Armas all are impressive with their given role. Another thing that made the original Blade Runner so iconic was the soundtrack. And with this film it is no exception. Though this has Hans Zimmer Benjamin Wallfisch collaborating it feels a individual work like the first one. What else can I say? No praise is enough for what I just witnessed. This is one of those films that will inspire people to be filmmakers, that will make people realize why we go to cinemas and spent our hard earned cash, that will continue to put cinemas as art forms. Just go to the biggest theater possible and witness an piece of modern art put on by extremely visionary and talented people. You will not regret it. 10/10"
136," Children crying and not going to bed?
","Put them in front of the TV to watch this! They will fall asleep in no time flat. Voila! problem solved. What is more? They will watch a few hundred kids work as slaves and learn a lesson in being brats and demanding this and wanting that. Of course, we all know they have fallen asleep by then so you may want to show that part the fifth or sixth time you need a 'babysitter.'As for grown men, well as the reviews say the threesome was cool and the girlfriend had nice feminine hair, but you can just Youtube that."
137," A new Sci-Fi masterpiece. Each element of this movie is just amazing and they work very well together.
","Non-Spoiler ReviewThe cinematography is absolutely beautiful and stunning and it represented the world of Blade Runner very well which I liked most about the original. Alongside the visual effects, it also expanded the world and showed how it evolved over the 30 years gap.The story is very effective and unpredictable, each character has a compiling arc which all contributed to the main plot (main character's) and the later was very emotional and suspenseful which Ryan Gosling was perfect for. Other main cast members did great a performance as well from the famous ones; Ford, Leto and Wright, to the less known; Hokes, de Armas and Davis. Oh Dave Bautista did great as well.The Score was astonishing as expected from Zimmer and Wallfisch, it worked well with the movie and helped to build up the scenes.I would recommend watching the 3 shorts on WB YouTube channel before and the original Blade Runner."
138," Worth 35 years of wait for us
","I went out as soon as I could to watch it. From trailer it seemed to be very interesting and very beautiful, I also watched the original a week before once again. I truly love the original and I enjoyed the soundtrack for the whole week before, nothing is as close to the eerie original blade runner soundtrack. So I went in on the 3D version.I won't spoil a lot. The movie is beautifully shot, although I'll see in 2D as well, because I prefer 2D brightness compared to 3D. The storyline can stand alone in 2049, although that is something I thought at the beginning. The more film goes deeper into the story the more I felt connected to the original film and I think the goers who have not seen the original or did not loved it for the all the weird reasons, will miss out on atmosphere and emotions conveyed in 2049. I enjoyed the duration, I enjoyed the acting, DP (well everyone is right about it). I had a little trouble to navigate into the 2049 storyline though, but I think it was on purpose, because by the end of the movie I still had (like in original blade runner) this monstrous question over (although different this time), I had a different feeling, I had confusion and I had developed love for the character - I think this would not be possible be it more concrete story, so by the end it helped to give the viewer exactly what he went in for (at least for me).Compared to the original, 2049 is more complex film, has a more complex storyline, but is worth every second of watching it. It is worth 30 years of wait. It is worth everything, for those who loved the original this is a beautiful continuation. It left me crying and as well thinking and as well it still leaves lot of questions. This is truly a beautiful film and Villeneuve has done amazing job on any aspect. Music, tension, visuals, acting and everything in 2049 feels complete, some scenes are simply fantastic both in action, physics involved and of course visually. I'm still in awe from this one, still thinking about it, and still having the emotion that I left the cinema with - and this is definitely something we pay money for. It sucks because I think general audience will not be moved by this dark sci-fi, but it is so beautiful and poetic, 2049 is obviously destined to be another cult. I also assume that haters will be saying how complicated this one is compared to the original but I have to say the complexity just made it more beautiful and let's be realistic making a sequel on the original could not be a streamlined story. Go watch 3 shorts as well on youtube to have some questions filled. If I had only one regret and complain about this film it would be that soundtrack album for this is not as beautiful as the original, but I guess that is what Hans Zimmer means, bringing in Vangelis was a very different thing for the original and bringing generic score composer on this one is well not enough creative I guess (nothing against Zimmer, but I was waiting for something more vulnerable as OST), and I would as well say that dialogues are not as powerful as in original, I wanted ""tears in rain"" moment here too, but I guess that is the result of a more complex storyline, we do not get that obvious phrases, but we get such a dense emotions through interior dialogues of characters and the atmosphere that it is enough. Overall words and review from my perspective is just a ramble, go and watch it and love it and feel it and bleed it - this is such a powerful cinematic piece!"
139," The 35 Year Wait is Worth It
","It's been 35 years since Ridley Scott delivered his iconic sci-fi noir based on Philip K. Dick's novella 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?' and now director Denis Villeneuve has brought us a sequel that many fans have been anxiously anticipating. Was the three and a half decade wait worth such a lengthy hiatus? Honestly it sure as hell was in this writer's opinion.A brief plot synopsis: 30 years after Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) hunted replicants, Tyrell Corp has now been bought by wealthy financier Niander Wallace (Oscar winner Jared Leto) who now manufactures obedient replicants who don't question their purpose unlike their predecessors. However replicant Blade Runner 'K' (Ryan Gosling) soon begins to find bizarre clues that lead him to question whether he actually is a replicant or may have been human when he finds some bones at the sight of his most recent assignment. Soon the agent goes on the run in order to find the truth and it's a slow-boiling adventure that will make your mind race.Director Denis Villeneuve casts this film quite well especially with Ryan Gosling's portrayal of the new Blade Runner. Gosling's K is the character we stick with for the majority of the film's nearly three hour run-time and the actor is more than capable of commanding the screen and bringing a supposedly emotionless character to life. Gosling sticks to stone-faced expressions for the film as K is quickly revealed as a replicant and is extremely skilled at his profession (like Deckard before him), but when K finds the bones of a female replicant (a character from the original film) and as he probes further into the case K begins to question if he is actually human and Gosling's stony fa√ßade begins to crumble little by little. K begins to feel some form of love for his A.I. called Joi (Ana de Armas), he has a moment where he cries after finding a wooden horse that he remembered having as a child and even at the film's climax K smiles at Deckard and has a look of serenity after the old Blade Runner leaves K alone outside.Original star Harrison Ford doesn't appear until the film's final act which is beautifully built up. Not much is explained about Rick Deckard's thirty year absence except for hinting about his job being a main reason and who he took off with at the original film's conclusion. Thankfully not having the original film's star appear until near the end helps keep the emphasis on K and his mission.Sadly the most underused character in the film is the primary antagonist, Niander Wallace. Jared Leto brings his usual A-game to this blind mogul, but his screen-time is so limited that we never get to know much about Wallace other than his takeover of the bankrupt Tyrell Corporation and his mission to create replicants who won't question their lives like Roy Batty and company in the original 1982 film. What lead Wallace to create replicants who are subservient is never made clear, but it could be that Wallace is aware of what happened with Roy Batty and his group of rogue replicants in ""Blade Runner"". Leto's performance in the film is good as he has to use his voice and subtle body language as Niander is blind; his voice lilts from his trademark softness when close enough to another actor to a slightly raised when he enters a scene or gives a bit of a lecture. However Leto isn't wasted and makes the most of his brief screen-time and does leave an impression.The film's style is just as distinctive here as it was in the 1982 film. While Ridley Scott's visuals had a little more lighting in a mostly blackened landscape, Villeneuve's film is even bleaker as the cinematography (shot marvelously by Roger Deakins) with grays, dark yellow-gold and black for the shadows; the three leads, K, Rick Deckard and Niander Wallace are introduced in shadow when they each speak their first line of dialogue. With this sequel the new color palate makes the setting of 2049 L.A. even more dystopic than the 1982 film was and also capitalizes on technology that is now available in the film's time-line like the flying cars seen in the original, A.I. being a psychical presence (evidenced by Joi's hologram form) and of course our replicant hero. The film also has some subtle throwbacks to its predecessor like K eating Asian cuisine alone in a Chinatown-like district which is similar to Rick Deckard in the 1982 film. Another highlight of the film is the musical score (co-written by Oscar winner Hans Zimmer) which almost has a war drum feel to it as the pounding percussive vibrations are like a call to arms and echo heart-pounding anxiety.With a nearly 3 hour run-time the film does feel a bit tedious at certain points, but the action scenes help speed some of the slower sections up thanks to the relentless movement of characters and the driving musical score. The story is a potboiler of events; a slowly escalating chase between K and Wallace's replicant assistant, Love, as she is restless in her pursuit of our hero once he essentially goes AWOL. There are many emotional moments that might produce some tears or make you wring your hands.Go see this movie and experience a new adventure"
140," The first proper ""science fiction"" film with a big budget to come out in a LONG time
","Sci-fi is everywhere these days, but real science fiction, the sort that plays with big ideas in a way you've never seen before, is hard to come by... especially in big budget movies. I'm talking about films like the Matrix or the original Blade Runner, which create worlds unlike anything seen before that are built upon scintillating ethical quandaries. There are still shows (like Black Mirror) and books that do this kind of thing, but this is probably the first blockbuster film released in my lifetime to achieve what this on the same scale as the classics. There are a couple of scenes in particular that explored concepts I had never seen before in a way that could never have been done in an earlier or lower-budgeted movie.Speaking of things were done in the film, the cinematography is absolutely outstanding. For those not in the know, the Director of Photography on this film (Roger Deakins) has been nominated for an Oscar 13 times... and has never won. When you watch this film, you can tell he's pushing real hard for this to be the time he wins. Every single shot is stunning, to the degree where you can almost feel the furious determination behind it. Watching Blade Runner 2049 feels like being punched in the face for three hours by an art gallery with a vendetta. At this point, if Deakins doesn't win, the Academy is being just downright cruel. Even funnier than the sheer madness of the cinematography is the critical reaction to this whole situation; the reviews seem to talk more about Deakins than Denis Villeneuve; the director of the film!The movie is nearly three hours long and pretty slow paced, yet I didn't feel a minute of it. I was surprised when it ended; I was sure there had to be another hour at least. That's how engrossing the film was. I think people should do their very best to avoid spoilers because the experience of watching the film unravel for the first time was absolutely brilliant. For once the studio managed to restrain themselves, and not give away the whole movie in the trailers. In fact, I was pleased to discover not only that all the clich√© dialogue and moments in the entire film had been put in the trailer, but also that those moments had a much less conventional meaning once put into the context of the film. Ryan Gosling in particular had me worried with his completely bland and emotionless face in the trailers, but the in the movie he showed more range, justified the moments from the trailers, and created one of the most interesting characters in the movie.The only element of the film that I found to be somewhat lacking was the sound design. Vangelis' sweeping soundtrack was one of the most iconic aspects of the original film, creating half the atmosphere of the world. That music is notably absent from this film with one notable exception late in the film. It is replaced by a generic, forgettable, and at times ill-fitting suspense soundtrack with one or two synth sounds thrown in as a vain attempt to recapture Vangelis' magic.In short, Denis Villeneuve has crafted a true science-fiction masterpiece, a film that somehow manages to rise to the level of the original film and stand alone as an impressive achievement in its own right."
141," Simply boring
","This film tells the story of a modified, manufactured man who hunts down and kill old versions of manufactured men. The discovery of a secret makes him re- evaluate his life and values.It is unfortunate that""Blade Runner 2049"" is so desperate to impressed with great lighting, to the point that it ignores the story. Scenes drag on several times the length needed to tell a story, making the film overly long. The first hour already felt like eternity, and the next 100 minutes were even longer. People in the cinema were restless, head resting on hands or just looked at the ground because it was so boring. The story was thin, and could have been told in a short time. Even the drowning scene had no sense of thrill, urgency or threat. It is simply plain boring."
142," Futuristic version of A Fistful Of Dollars.
","To be honest with the reader of this review, I had never seen the first Blade Runner however it had been near the top of my ""must- watch"" science fiction movie list in my head for a very long while now and I decided to watch this movie expecting an exciting sci-fi blockbuster with action-packed car chases rolling in all over the place. Surprisingly this film was not the ""good action-packed popcorn fun for the whole family"" that I was expecting and the film actually takes the slower, more patient and realistic approach with it's storytelling rather than a lot of car chases and rushed editing. This is a very similar film to the likes of A Fistful Of Dollars because the main character, Ryan Gosling, resembles the personality of Clint Eastwood's character in A Fistful Of Dollars, the musical score carries away the movie like A Fistful Of Dollars, the pacing remains slow however manages successfully to keep our interest like A Fistful Of Dollars and the film carries an incredibly dark, bleak tone much like A Fistful Of Dollars. I'm glad I saw this movie earlier than most people because then I can write a good review for this movie so that more people can consider watching it before the negative remarks start coming in. Before those come in, let me remind you that this movie is pure, bleak, raw and dark science-fiction to the core that goes with the dedication to telling a story rather than the dedication to kill as much people as possible. It goes with the more slow approach which some people may find a bad thing but others like me will find a good thing. But I think something all viewers will respect here in this movie is the intense cinematography that is common in a lot of other Denis Villeneuve movies and the fascinating special effects as well as the subtle performances by Ryan Gosling who understands the character he is playing and doesn't overdo it. Ryan Gosling's character is an interesting one because although he is emotionless and straight- forward we, as the viewers, can detect that there is more to this character and throughout the movie we slowly start to see a bit more of his own self. Blade Runner 2049 focuses mostly on the main character and if you are going to see this movie expecting Harrison Ford to have a lot of screen time that is similar to the length of Ryan Gosling's screen time, you're very wrong because Harrison Ford only plays a minor role in this movie which is, although important, not the main focus of the movie. Even if someone can view this movie as a science-fiction movie, someone can also view this movie as a character piece instead depending on their preference because of how much dedicated focus is on the main character.When the movie was finished and all was done, despite the reasonably long runtime I still felt that the movie should of been even longer. Because I don't like to be sentimental I gave myself thirty seconds and then I got up from my chair and walked out as the credits rolled despite me still being in a very deep emotional zone however I want you to know that the emotional zone was almost impossible to get out of. As I was walking out I still saw a person watching the credits in his chair and I understood that he was also in a very deep emotional state and people usually do that so that they look cool to their friends, but the person I saw really was in an emotional zone - I could tell. I could also tell that I wasn't the only one that enjoyed this movie in the room and I was relieved because I was a bit afraid that people wouldn't like it because of it's more slower approach than other science-fiction movies. I was incredibly glad that someone else understood the style of the movie.I'm not going to spoil any more of the movie but I will leave a last note to say that Blade Runner 2049 is an incredibly dark and intense movie that is probably one of the best science-fiction movies I've seen that has been made in the last five years so it very much is a masterpiece. If a futuristic version of A Fistful Of Dollars sounds bloody good to you, then you'd be killing yourself if you didn't pay this movie a visit at your nearest cinema. In my personal opinion, the film was most definitely a masterpiece and it has me even more excited for seeing the original starring Harrison Ford in the main role."
143," A slow moving art film that has an engaging yet provocative concept, nonetheless an immersive experience with incredible atmosphere and ground-breaking visuals.
","Only several criticisms that came to my mind in this futuristic mystery noir about a missing child, and the existential crisis that engulfs not only the officer investigating the case but the very nature of our very own existence. The story again revolves around several characters that were placed in a grand, epic environment, hence creating a small plot that implored more substance to other branches in the existing world. The unanswered question still clouded over as to why Tyrell Corporation intended to create near perfect replicants when they were only used as slave labour? The biggest concern probably is the existence of government/military supervision (and that's whether they will occur in future instalments/sequels remains to be seen) hasn't yet intervened after so many years? There is also no mention of pharmaceutical companies which may have also benefited in terms creating vaccines or genetically modified transplants which questions the very existence of A.I. and its purpose in a volatile environment in which humans incurred a famine, blackout, etc within the 30 year time period. Perhaps the film would have benefited by expanding the dystopian future, delving more into the co-existence/relationships between humans and the highly advanced versions of bio-engineered androids within each sector from education/technological advancements in health/rehabilitation to governing cities/countries. Why again is there only a single megalomaniacal industrialist seeking his own ambitions in order to fully utilise and strengthen the existing populace of replicants? A minor glitch is that there is no mention of contention from other corporations/factions that may seek supremacy or political gains. Most concerning, as mentioned before in the original film is why did Tyrell Corporation intended to create androids that were indistinguishable than the human counterparts? After all they were only intended to be used as slave labour/servants for elite corporations on earth, and on other planets presumably excavating various natural resources for exactly what purposes?Due to the long duration, the film may not have covered the many complex issues that will inevitably arise as technology progresses over the years and how it will affect the existence of humanity and future generations, I was still fascinated by the many other questions raised in the film surrounding our very own existence between humans and androids which will eventually over time lead to larger and more sinister plots/story lines in order to fully realise this long and perilous journey (A geisha taking a red pill to see how far the rabbit hole really goes in the real world, as seen in the original film). Regardless, a repeat viewing is still required to fully grasp the merits it's still one of those rare, visually spectacular, thought- provoking and profound experiences I've encountered on the big screen; highly recommend the IMAX version, preferably in 3D."

145," An Unforgettable Cinema Experience
","Blade Runner 2049 was an absolutely stunning sequel to the original film of the series from 1982. As a fan of Blade Runner, my already high expectations were completely blown out of the water by the captivatingly unpredictable writing and the incredibly artistic cinematography. This movie has some of my favorite scenes in all of film to date; shots that left my jaw dropped and my spine tingling in my seat. I actively crave my next experience watching this movie and cannot wait to be thrust back into its breathtaking cyberpunk landscape. This movie will leave a permanent impact on me, and I expect to return to it many times in my life to feel the original rush I got when watching this film in theaters.Blade Runner(1982) is a timeless classic that deserves to be honored in only the most carefully crafted and perfected of manners. Denis Villeneuve and the entire crew did exactly that with this masterpiece."
146," A real disappointment
","I loved original but I have to say I really hated this one. From movie music score to plot and cinematography - everything was a disappointment. The music score (loud noise) and cinematography was especially heavy handed in trying to force drama when it was not warranted by plot. Instead of so much CGI producers should have spent some $ on a better script and director. A bad movie should not be this long, people walked out at my showing."
147," When a Blade Loses It's Edge.
","Beautiful and empty Bladerunner 2049 is the needless squeal to the 1980s classic.Set 30+ years after the events of the first film we meet Ryan Gosling continuing in the Bladerunner tradition of shooting robots. Along the way, he discovers a great secret that might change the social order of a world that is made up of humans and they're purpose built slaves.All of that was covered in the first 20 minutes of the film by the way. Skip ahead to the 3rd act, grumpy Harrison Ford shows up and, well, that's about it.Leaving the theatre my wife and I tried to decide just why Bladerunner left us both feeling so indifferent to it's existence. She had never seen the first film, I had, but our feelings were the same. Bladerunner is great to look at and I appreciated the nods to the original, but, it became quickly apparent our apathy stemmed from the fact nothing much happens in this movie.Office K's (Gosling) investigation into a missing person moves at snails pace and none of the people we meet along the way are as interesting as the scenery around them. One example is Wallace (Jared Leto) the new Tyrell and the main villain of the film. His speeches are dull and only go to serve the plot, he leaves all of his serious evilness to his sidekick while he stays home sporting a handicap which must be a desired physical affectation considering how easily it could be treated in his time.The main theme in both Bladerunner movies is one day the slaves will cast off their chains and be free. Sure, there's stuff about love and self-awareness but these are side issues that have been explored elsewhere to better effect. The main focus of 2049 is humanity needs an indentured underclass to do its heavy lifting and either you are for it or against it and that is a pretty thin premise for a movie this long.Late in the film Officer K sits on a deck chair staring out over an irradiated city. He looks like a man lost, not knowing where to go next. This moment is the perfect metaphor for Bladerunner 2049. All of it's surprises are revealed too early on leaving both the audience and characters to mull over the same obvious of choices for the rest of the movie.A wasted opportunity."
148," Just Another Middle Of The Road Movie
","This film is just another average modern production. It shares the same faults and advantages as all the other films being release nowadays.It is too long. Directors start believing in themselves and banish their editors to the corner The CGI is great and improves day by day. The palette is impressive here, but the originality of the prequel is gone.Reviewers are overwhelmingly obedient when they have to be and are overly positive. Moreover, the reviews are give away the plot. going on I knew what half the story was.It is a sequel. Dick wrote one book on the topic. Why are there two films now? Hollywood is addicted to its sequels. This drug is bad for the taker, but Hollywood cannot break the habit.Not enough good looking flaunting women. These are PC times we live in, which is sad for the eyes.Movie is slow. Should they bring back intermissions? They could, but in today's busy society it will not work.This sequel was not a necessity, but it is not bad either. It just is too stereotypical for current films."

150," One of the best sequels EVER
","""Blade Runner 2049"" (2017 release; 162 min.) brings the story of K. As the movie opens, we get a thumbnail reminder/explanation of what replicants are and what a blade runner is. The newest generation replicants (in ""California 2049"" we are told) are fully integrated into society. We see K visit a farm outside LA, where he ""retires"" an old model replicant who had taken up farming. On the farm, K stumbles upon a mysterious box that contains the remains of a female replicant who it seems was pregnant and died while delivering the child. How could that be possible? At this point we are less than 15 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: first, this is the long-awaited (35 years!) sequel to the seminal sci-fi movie ""Blade Runner"", which when it came out in 1982 was light-years ahead of its time and cemented Ridley Scott as one of the top directors of his generation. This time around, Denis Villeneuve (who previously has brought us, among others, the excellent ""Sicario"" and ""Arrival"") is at the helm, and, apparently not feeling the weight of sky-high expectations 3+ decades in the making, Villeneuve takes us on a journey that delivers, and then some. This is a plot-heavy movie, so the lesser said, the better. But a couple of general observations: I cannot easily recall a movie where the production and set design is so integral to the plot, and so remarkable. The production budget for this movie reportedly was $150 million, and it certainly shows. But even more important, it is absolutely amazing how closely this sequel stays true to the original movie in spirit and in tone. If you are expecting an ""action movie"" (as the Blade Runner 2049 trailer gave the impression), you will be wildly disappointed. Sure there are some action scenes, but the movie is slow-paced in the best possible way. Ryan Gosling brings perhaps the finest performance of his career as K. And don't be mistaken, this is a Ryan Gosling movie far more than it is a Harrison Ford movie (who finally appears almost 2 hours into it). Cuban actress Ana de Armas (previously in ""Hands of Stone"" and ""War Dogs"") has a break-out performance as K's virtual PA. Jared Leno has a small but noteworthy role as the replicant manufacturer Wallace. Robin Wright stars as K's boss in the LAPD. Dutch actress Sylvia Hoeks (keeping the Dutch connection with the 1982 movie starring Dutch actor Rutger Hauer) is remarkable as Wallace's enforcer Luv. Last but certainly not least, the original score (credited to Benjamin Wallfisch and Hans Zimmer) is very much Vangelis-inspired and sounds glorious. Beware: at 2 hrs. and 45 min., this is a dense movie which takes its time, but which rewards richly for those wanting to invest their time, interest and emotional involvement.""Blade Runner 2049"" opened wide this weekend and I couldn't wait to see it. I went to see it with my 30 yr. old son. In anticipation, we had watched (for me: re-watched) the original movie, and our expectations were high. Even so (or despite that), we were both stunned how good this movie was. We literally couldn't movie from our seats when it was over and we stayed stuck for the entire end credits (which seemingly take forever). The Saturday early evening screening where we saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended nicely, but by no means was it a sell-out. Regardless, if you liked the 1982 movie, I bet you will LOVE this sequel, one of the best ever sequels in my humble opinion. I'd readily suggest you check out ""Blade Runner"", be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion."
151," Slow, Bad, and Lousy show - time wasters!
","IF there is a 0, this movie deserved it fully.Here's why: 1. It is awfully long and draggy More than 2 hours of screen time, with simple and needless scene taking more than 10 seconds to show.... nothing but time wasters. Does not contribute to the plot. I have a feel the director just felt that he did a lousy job, might as well throw in as many scenes as possible to hopefully gain some sympathy vote from its viewers.Here is my sympathy vote... 1 out of 10 rating. This 1 is given because i can't bring the rating further down.Denis Villeneuve - i will forever ban your show. If i see your name, i will surely not want to watch the show2. Poor story plot Its a very simple story but poorly done. Due to the drag in the show, the story gets muddled up.3. Everyone was waiting to get out of the cinema. I have never get into a cinema where i heard so much of conversations among the viewers, and yet the rest beside them were not unhappy about. Why? Because the movie is awfully draggy. We just stayed on to enjoy the air conditioner since we had paid for the show.4. Most number of audience found sleeping throughout the screening I haven't seen so many sleepers in a movie before. This has to be record number i have seen.Right across my row, about 4 of them were found sleeping. Beside me, that guy was sleeping. In front of me, the gentleman kept moving around. Behind me, people were snoring loudly.THIS IS how BAD this movie is."
152," Denis Villeneuve... making sci-fi great again
","Los Angeles, 2049. Thirty years have passed since Deckard and Rachael fled the city to make a life of their own. The futuristic cityscapes created by visionary director Ridley Scott were the perfect backdrop for one of the most influential science-fiction films of all time. While the creative team may have changed for Blade Runner 2049, the cityscapes remain for one of the best experiences I've had at the cinema in 2017.When K (Ryan Gosling), a young blade runner, uncovers a long-buried secret that could change the future for both humans and Replicants, he tracks down former blade runner Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) for answers.It's no secret that audiences didn't take to Blade Runner straight away upon its release in 1982, people not seeing the mark the film stamped in the genre of sci-fi or film history until the years after. Several versions of the film and over thirty years later, Denis Villeneuve brings us Blade Runner 2049, a direct sequel and continuation from Scott's final cut of his original film.Villeneuve, who I'd have to describe as a visionary, is one of the most exciting directors working today and he brings his A-game to Blade Runner 2049. It's always risky making a sequel after such a long time, especially for a film as renowned as Blade Runner however, from the very get go, it's clear that this film is being made by someone who is incredibly indebted to and respectful of the original.This is a beautifully crafted film, visually stunning and utterly engrossing in its narrative. I was worried about how they would take the story forward but knowing nothing about the plot and going in blind worked wonders because I was gripped from the opening shot to the very last. The runtime could have been an issue but when the film is of such a high quality, it ultimately flies by and finishes too soon if anything.The work from Roger Deakins on the film's cinematography is nothing short of masterful, surpassing Jordan Cronenweth's work on the original which is no easy task. Deakins has never won the Academy Award and if he doesn't for his work on Blade Runner 2049, I'll lose hope in him ever picking up the award. The music from Vangelis in Blade Runner was mesmerising and while both Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch ensure this film has an impressive soundtrack, it never comes close to topping Vangelis'. Coming to the performances, Blade Runner 2049 features a cast intent on making this as memorable as the original. Ryan Gosling leads the film with an impressive performance where the subtlety of facial expressions are as important as the delivery of lines, leading to arguably Gosling's best performance to date. The returning Harrison Ford is as gruff as you'd expect as a Deckard who's been in hiding for thirty years, his pivotal role in the film surprising yet incredibly worthwhile.The supporting roles, ranging from minor to major, are filled by plenty of capable actors, whether it be Jared Leto's mysterious turn as Niander Wallace or Robin Wright's authoritative showing as Lt. Joshi. The pleasant surprise was Ana de Armas, who I didn't think too much of as an actress prior to this film.Blade Runner 2049 is a heavy dose of pure science fiction that will leave a lasting impression on the genre for sure. With this and Arrival last year, Denis Villeneuve seems to be on a one man mission to make sci-fi great again."
153," Another soulless Denis Villeneuve movie 2 out of 10
","Why this film has so much critical praise is beyond me, visually it does have some merit but in no way is this close to the brilliance of the original. The plot moves at a snails pace and as with other Denis Villeneuve movies lacks a soul, characters you actually care about and a plot twist that is nowhere near as clever as it thinks it is (yes I'm talking about the other turd fest that was Arrival) The one and only SPOILER I'm going to discuss in this review if you can call it that is?""The Ryan Gosling sex scene""and I won't reveal much. Basically if you've seen the far superior Patrick Swayze classic Ghost your getting the whoopi Goldberg/ Demi Moore love scene rehashed for a futuristic world and yes it comes across as pathetic as in sounds. Never in my wildest dreams did I think I'd be comparing Blade Runner 2049 to Ghost or even one I haven't mentioned ""watching paint dry"". Especially on the back of such outlandish reviews as best sequel ever. In terms of sequels I class this as an Alien 3 of sequels, we had the original Blade Runner and Alien films both sci-fi classics but I expected Blade Runner 2049 to be the Aliens of sequels instead of the Alien 3 of sequels a bit rubbish if your honest but there's always some weirdos who'll like it.Even the the sight of a skyscraper sized topless Ana de Armas hologram failed to arouse any emotion within me after being bored to a near death state by the first 2hrs let alone the remaining 44 minutes."

156," 'I've seen things you people wouldn't believe...'
","My memories of Blade Runner 2049 won't be washed away any time soon. More Blade Runner than Blade Runner? No. And yet this is what makes Blade Runner 2049 brilliant. Of course any consideration of Villeneuve's film must take account of the now sacrosanct original, and this is something Villeneuve himself has evidently been aware of from the outset. It is obvious throughout the film, tonally, thematically, musically, and in almost every other aspect that not only the director but the entire cast and crew hold a deep reverence for the original film, in a manner akin to its many fans. Again and again the film draws inspiration from Blade Runner, as the 'feel' of Scott's film imbues this sequel in its entirety, and yet, astoundingly, Villeneuve's production balances indebtedness with independence. Due to skillful and assured direction, emotionally nuanced performances, incisive cinematography and sound, and perhaps most importantly, some truly beautiful writing, this film has the strength to emerge from the shadow of Blade Runner and become its own distinct entity. In Blade Runner Roy Batty declares that it's 'quite a thing to live in fear', and yet Villeneuve's film manages to avoid this traumatic state, dreading neither the weight of the original nor the subsequent expectation upon its shoulders, as it cleverly recalls Scott's film whilst following its own direction. 2049 builds upon the eclectic themes of its predecessor in a thoughtful, moving and sometimes shocking manner, satisfying audience expectations given the arc of the original story - Villeneuve playfully echoes its diegetic and moral ambiguities - without ever sinking into the kind of palimpsestic homage we've witnessed in films such as The Force Awakens. Once again Gosling is on fine form, and whilst some critics might mistakenly interpret his performance as restricted and somewhat lifeless, he in fact offers both the quiet fortitude and humanity that the role demands; you can understand why he was so desired for the part. Stylistic and character based twists upon the original characters abound, and yet in reprising his role as Deckard Ford also excels, whilst the supporting cast are all committed and, crucially, in tune with the aura of the film. Jared Leto's performance is perhaps slightly melodramatic at points for some, however he is integral to some of the film's strongest moments (one very raw scene in particular stands out - you'll know it when you see it).My only criticism would be that at 163 minutes the film loses a little of the focused intensity which contributes to the original's brilliance, however the emotional payoff for this extended length is rewarding and not altogether misguided. In the end such criticisms are largely nitpicking, as the film excels in all areas and stands as one of the strongest releases of the year. Bravo to Villeneuve and co., they can certainly be proud of what they have produced. Perhaps the greatest compliment that can be paid is that much like Scott did so powerfully in his original (after the excision of certain studio-led material), Villeneuve and his team have produced a visually immersive, gripping and considered interrogation of questions central to not only those in the audience, and not even simply those in the world around them, but also those that will come after Blade Runner 2049's release. Consequently it feels as though this too will maintain its place in popular culture, and in doing so remind us of the power of cinema to understand humanity's past, present and future."
157," Vapid, Barren, Antiseptic, Drubbed Down, and Dull
","The original blade runner had gritty street-scenes that were immersive and set the stage for believing, imagining, and then becoming immersed in the context of a dystopian future. In terms of grit, nothing from the original movie survived into the current production. The characters in the sequel are vapid (caricatures) in comparison to the original movie. Tyrell was a thoughtful genius, Roy was passionately fighting his own pre programmed mortality ,Pris could not find humanity, and Leon was locked into the anger of his past, Sebastian was captive to his own body. Then there was Rachel who was searching for personage and Decker for purpose. NONE of that kind of character developing can be found in this sad excuse for amovie.This movie was a shell, a sham, they even had a shell of a Pris character. A total vapid, barren, antiseptic, drubbed down, and dull waste. This movie did not even have the decency to have any grit."
158," No longer trust reviews. Boring, dragged on, flat story. Good visuals.
","I'll keep it short, unlike the unnecessarily long movie. It's simply too boring. The whole movie, the story can actually be done and dusted within less than an hour if it wasn't unnecessarily extended and dragged on, and if the characters weren't always moving so inexplicably slow.Sure the visuals and cinematography is great, but a movie isn't just a photography slideshow, or a TV demo. I mean, had it been called that beforehand we would all know that's the only thing we're in for.Also learnt for the last time not to trust the reviews anymore, especially for new releases. I've seen time and time again that it's not as reliable as it used to be. I predict the rating will fall in time (actually has since I've seen it). Back to pre-internet days where word of mouth is more reliable."
159," Goes through all the motions of a good movie but has no meat on it
","As someone I know said, this is a ""cargo cult movie"". It has all the exterior of what a great Blade runner sequel would look like but there is little underneath. Visuals are stunning, music and sound are good, camera work is as it should be, but when you get down to its core, there's little there. I am not usually the one to complain about a slow pacing or a plot that requires some suspense of belief, but here It seems they serve as a way to achieve the deep and philosophical feel without actually being either. Acting overall is mediocre at best, actors fail to convincingly relay emotion of the characters, that are themselves written quite shallow, unrelatable and one dimensional. There are some interesting questions raised by the plot, the whole thing is far from a total disaster, but nothing is explored deep enough or clearly enough to be truly interesting or engaging. That's why this movie is going to be remembered just as a sequel to it's famous original."
160," in a word, spectacular
","My wife and I streamed the 2007 ""final cut"" version of Blade Runner last weekend and went to see BR 2047 today; it's just spectacular. The attention to detail is amazing. Roger Deakins hits another home run with lighting that's perfectly natural. His framing is, well, it's Deakins; it doesn't get much better. And the sets... dang. Those people should be picking up some serious awards for this film. The music is awesome, the use of Tibetan horns is perfect. And the rest of the sound was amazing. Anyone who's interested in sound should make a trek to the theater for this movie.Contrary to many, I thought the pacing was perfect. As was the length. I can't think of anything I'd be willing to cut, or anything I'd be willing to shorten.I loved the original Blade Runner; this sequel actually builds on and exceeds the original. I wound not have thought that possible.After Arrival and now BR 2047, Denis Villeneuve is my new favorite director."
161," What a bore
","What a bore.The film felt like it went on for a lot longer than it actually was, and with a very thin plot stretched out for 2 hours and 40 minutes. It would have been quicker to read 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep' by Philip K Dick, which influenced the original film.The imagery and special affects are spectacular. The sound track is clearly influenced by the original film and was quite good. The film didn't get anywhere near the atmosphere of the 1982 film.There were times when it was hard to hear some of the dialogue but as most of that dialogue was pointless waffle that wasn't too much of an issue. There were long scenes of dull silence followed by long scenes of needless chatter, all with no action or interest.I got so bored watching this I counted 17 people leave the screen in the last hour of the film who didn't return.Ryan Gosling (K) was mostly poor throughout the film. A small tree in a leather jacket could have played that role just as well.Ana de Armas (Joi) stood out amongst the cast as K's hologram love interest, backed by spectacular computer imagery.Jered Leto played Niander Wallace, for some reason. His scenes were amongst the longest and most tedious. They went on and on with the dullest dialogue in the whole film.I since found out that Director Denis Villeneuve is also responsible for Sicario and Arrival. If I'd known beforehand I wouldn't have bothered going to see the third film in his 'Trilogy of Tripe'.Don't go out of your way to see this. Stay at home and watch the 1982 original, it's so much better."
162," beautiful but disappointing
","The movie is definitely a masterpiece in terms of cinematography. Ryan Gosling does a decent job as well. That's where it ends though. The most frustrating part about it is how it insults the intelligence of the viewer. While the original movie was laid down like a puzzle (the unicorn dreams and origami at different moments in the movie) this one just spells out everything to make sure the dumbest person could get it. The only thing missing was a big sign flashing: ""pay attention here"" . The flashbacks were placed totally artificially and the whole sequence was so linear it hurts. Also the whole story was way too shallow and included too many cheap tearjerkers.Another frustrating thing is how, just like all the other recent reboots, it just runs on pure nostalgia while adding virtually nothing new. Edward James Olmos's appearance is a perfect example. The short scene involving him adds nothing to the story. It's just there because they had to find some reason to put him in the movie.They should have left the original movie alone."
163," Fat Women in SUVs Won't Appreciate It
","But 6 stars for the slim and appealing women.
The technology is cool.
The movie still does not make sense."
164," Blade Runner 2049 is a visual masterpiece.
","Blade Runner 2049 is the sequel that measures equally to its predecessor, a masterpiece in its own right. However, it seems much like the original, that Blade Runner 2049 will not meet its status as an iconic sci-fi film for some years to come. This is a visual masterpiece, depicting the most beautiful ruin of a city that has graced a film. From beginning to end in its 2h 44min run-time, it captivates the wonder of a decrepit dystopian world, all of which is shot beautifully by the incomparable Roger Deakins. The cast led by Ryan Gosling who plays ""K"" and Harrison Ford who returns as ""Rick Deckard"", act superbly to create an awe-inspiring film on the big screen. Under the direction of Denis Villeneuve, Blade Runner 2049 shows that he is one of the most talented directors and one of the few masters of storytelling in the movie business today."
165," Blade Runner 2049 - A monumental feat of genius sci-fi filmmaking
","Let me start by saying that I am fairly new to the Blade Runner universe. Prior to seeing 2049, I had only had the pleasure of seeing the original twice (both times being The Final Cut), and both viewings within the month leading up to the new installment, helmed by French-Canadian Denis Villeneuve, a man who has solidified himself as quite possibly my favorite working director at the moment. So, having been a massive (albeit brand new) Blade Runner fan, does this one live up to the hype? In short, abso-frickin-lutely.I need to see it again now, not because of how much I enjoyed it, but because 2049 requires a great deal of thinking. The plot, the story developments aren't conveyed via words, but rather mainly through visuals. I won't deny that there were several segments throughout the film where I felt about as intelligent as a can-opener, because as an audience member you're forced to sit back and think about what has happened and why. There were moments where I actually had to ask myself if I was an idiot for not understanding why something was happening upon initial viewing, or is this a film that asks you to think instead of explicitly displaying everything you need to know at the tip of your fingers? After some theorizing once the movie ended I realized that it was definitely the latter. 2049 is one of very few sci-fi films that actually forces you to think, not because of plot convolution or narrative inconsistencies, but because of its complex nature.Everything is on point here. The direction is superb, as is the writing. The cinematography is genuinely among the best I've seen from a mainstream film (as is Gassner's heavenly production design). And every actor brings out some of their best performances (with Ford deserving special praise, he truly is a powerhouse here). Blade Runner 2049 represents a monumental achievement in modern-day filming that meets and supersedes the expectations set by Blade Runner (1982), thanks to the undeniable efforts of everyone involved."
166," Disappointing
","Anticlimactic and over-complicated in some places, generally boring. The plot made up entirely on excuses after excuses. It's more visual experience rather than sensual.And that visuals is pretty superficial and not entirely fits into built up environment so it feels very inconsistent. From that type of visual concept development and detailed design you definitely expect something more, than movie offers you.Overall, it's pretty mediocre and disappointing experience for me."
167," Touching Story and Smart Telling
","I recommend to saw the first one to enjoy more.The thing i love with that movie was the story telling, each time you just understand a key point, something,there is not false suspense seen miles away.this is a too much modern's movie curse when you feel the scenario is poorly edited.Also Everything is build around the theater experience. A pure art. amazing actors, amazing photography and a brilliant use of VFX's and sounds. It's kinda like after the first 3D where the movies are based on the visual, here in Blade Runner it's rock solid and this is the lights, colors and sounds are put in the front.This is why i love movies and this is the main reason to go to the theater. There is a lot of TRIBUTE of the first one and it took both new things and enhance what we saw in the first one. Like the editing process, slow paced. It's really good to take time, i realized i have a lot of souvenir of different shots, witch i usually don't on "" traditional "" 2 hours movies. And here you don't feel the classic final mass battle, of that kind of long length modern movies. this is just a deeper movie. For me the duration and the pace are well balan√ßed, and rare to see. Also a tribute to the first movie.It is the star wars 7 should have been. i'm not a particular fan of the first Blade Runner from 1982 one because i saw it too young ( but in 2000's ) and i didn't catch the essence of the movie.Well i've been hit at the end of the movie, and that's matter, a perfect ending timing and editing trough all the movie. So huge, so simple and so beautifully. Actually this is my favorite sci fi movie of all time."
168," Comparisons reveal the odious.
","I'm sickened by the fawning over this spectacularly empty drivel.So utterly characterless for something purporting to reflect on the nature of human consciousness. No character = no script, of course. The original revels subtly in the exploration of how identity and memory are intrinsic to one another. How the objects we surround ourselves persuade us of our identity. Gosling's apartment in contrast, characterless. Literally. There is no character that lives there. Perhaps they feared that a character, with an actually believable life, in the film might detract from the computerised holographic eye candy companion? Did Harvey Weinstein have some say in this element? This avatar of desire has potential for commentary, but resolves as an astonishing endorsement of computerised companionship as a viable alternative to human relationship. In our dystopian future, as the capacity for community dissolves, this is our great hope; the post prostitute/hologram wife sex - ""coffee?"" - results in smiles all round.¬† This element to the film made me a little physically sick and highly sympathetic to militant feminism. The film's clumsy attempts at visual poetry pale into comparison with the original - proving the point that the soul of the work is what creates a spectacle with substance, not computing power.Jared Leto's Kurtz impression might have fared better had their been any craft in the script. Perhaps if they'd gotten Rutger Hauer to improvise some lines there'd have been some semblance of originality, instead of memorable quotes such as ""You do not know...pain.""The score to the movie was effective, but lacked the nuanced, cohesive beauty of Vangelis' offering in the original; of course it suffers from the hodge podge on screen. There can be no artistic combinatorial explosion when so many elements are lacking in subtlety, originality...spirit. This deficit being exemplified by the Power Rangers finale...PEOW PEOW - HIIIIYA!!!And there is no spirit. This post-modern parable embodies and endorses the pseudo-scientific reductionist view of humanity as essentially worthless and doomed. It is an unrelentingly shallow and joyless indulgence with plot holes you could drive a bus through (it's a real memory... then it must be mine! *BOOOOM* - great work detective!). To give the team the benefit of the doubt, let's say that some elements may be excused by the use of focus groups by the studios. It wouldn't take much to alter the attitude of Gosling to his 3D spouse to highlight to the viewer the 1D nature of his relationship. Maybe those takes are on the cutting room floor, maybe there'll be a superior director's cut. I doubt it'll be any the better, the changes needing to be radical; including shaving about an hour off the running time.Perhaps the director's cut will appear before the sequel. Yes, thanks to the introduction of a rebellion, we can look forward to the Matrix style ""Bladerunner reloaded"", ""Bladerunner revolutions""...I wonder whether Netflix or Amazon will make the series? #justanotherfranchiseIn the year 2019, I believe this effort will suffer horribly from hindsight; unlike the majestic original...and we'll always have the original. A memory of exemplary filmic storytelling, indelibly etched in my mind forming part of my identity, available for generations to come...1*"
169," Captivating, Stunning, and Emotional. A Modern Masterpiece
","Just wonderful, what Denis Villeneuve did with this movie is fantastic. He did a sequel of the science fiction masterpiece that is Blade Runner, and he did it well. Not only well, but on the same level of the original, without a doubt.This movie tells the story of K, a Blade Runner of Los Angeles that discovers a secret that could bring the whole world to war. This is not a very good summary, but it's better you watch it without knowing too much about the story. Well, the first movie treated themes like what makes us human, our own identity and the ethics of robotics and so. This movie goes even further with this topics and develops them more, introducing many questions about the meaning of the characters and all this things, and it leaves you thinking a lot about it.Ryan Gosling is the main character K, and he is fantastic. I still have to watch a movie where he is not good at. He carried a big part of the movie, and you really connect with his character and his motivations. Then there is Harrison Ford, who reprises his role of Rick Deckard from the first movie, and even if he does not have many screen time, when he appears on screen, he owns the scene. Ana de Armas plays Joi, a mysterious character that I won't spoil anything about, but she has a really powerful performance. Sylvia Hoeks also has an important role in the movie and she is really badass and brings a great performance as the assistant of Wallace played by Leto. And now about Leto, he has a small role in the movie, even if he is in all the trailers, but he is really great. There are also some minor roles payed by some great actors like Robin Wright, Mackenzie Davis, Dave Bautista and even Edward James Olmos. They all don't have a really big role, but they add a lot to their characters and their scenes.Now, let me talk about the visuals. WOW! Roger Deakins deserves the Oscar just right now, because the visuals of this movie are really amazing. Not just Los Angeles city, but all the environments, the deserts, all of it it's just a beautifully crafted shot. This with the magnificent directional work of the great Villeneuve, creates a fantastic landscape that will captivate you for more than two hours and a half and will keep you staring at the screen with your eyes open looking at this stunning movie. Also I have to mention the also captivating and powerful score that Benjamin Wallfisch created with the help of Hans Zimmer. The soundtrack is really near the same level of the one Vangelis created for the first movie and together with the stunning imagery, the powerful performances and the captivating story, you have a really great piece of cinema art, that will come down as one of those classics of the science fiction..I would recommend this movie to everyone in general, but specially to the fans of the original, the fans of this director or the fans of science fiction, because this is truly a great achievement in the genre of the science fiction and in movies in general. Do not miss this one!"
170," Villeneuve screwed it up just as I thought he would
","This came out to be a 2+ hours of pretentious garbage. Ranging from a retarded-soulless dialogue to an annoyingly-monotonous sound track, from the simplistically-clich√© plot to the bland-jelly-fish color scheme. Everything is gutless in this pile of failure, especially the chubby sequel-implying ending.Villeneuve is such a try-hard. He just doesn't have the talent. He desperately tries to make up for this lack of talent with shallow long shots, meaningless misplaced close-ups, long pauses that lack tension and just about every other clich√© he could find in the book but inevitably failed to execute the intended appeal, which resulted in all of his movies being torturous experiments on the viewer. This one is no exception.Villeneuve is the ironic master of boring and flat movies. He couldn't have made a good movie if his life depended on it. Beats me why he is praised so much. I wouldn't hire the guy to cut my lawn.Seriously, if you want to waste 2 hours of your time - watch it. But I guarantee, you will not want to watch it again.This crap MUST NOT be associated with Philip K. Dick's work."
171," Simply Stunning
","I just got back, and as many others have already stated, the film is simply stunning. Bladerunner played with the notion of life and death brought emotions I rarely, if ever, have received from a film. The way the film showcases the beauty of the human body and our behaviors was fantastic. Changes in score and aggressive tones were perfectly placed and the cinematography was top-notch. For me though, the real masterpiece here was the story. I was engaged the entire time, and at no point felt any part was unnecessary. Ryan Gosling and Villeneuve are a dangerous combo. 5/5! I cannot recommend this movie enough. I wish I could go back and see it for the first time again, it was that good."
172," What's the point??
","It's so boring I would fall asleep two or three times if the music was not too loud. Sound mixing is a disaster. The only reason I did not leave the theater was that the story always had something above the threshold minimum to stay. Too many pointless scenes. Even pointless violence. And for God's sake, what's the point of the ending?? Is this all from the sequel of a masterpiece: to die for the good purpose? Really? It's so weak that it hurts. The only positive thing about the movie that it tries very hard to respect the first one, that's why I gave two stars. But it's way too superficial.Ps.: For the professionals: It's time to learn to create an atmosphere without so much color grading! At least look at the original...."
173," Disappointing... but still worth seeing
","This film had so much potential. It has great acting, wonderful and innovative special effects, lavish and imaginative environments, unique science fiction elements, it feels realistic, the music and tone are spot on, the cinematography is the kind you can watch for days... they only forgot story, and unfortunately that's kind of important. I was secretly hoping that they would have gone back to the source material, the original source material: the novel ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep."" The themes explored in that book are compelling and fascinating and include morality, religion, and what it means to be human. The original ""Blade Runner"" adopted some of these themes. This film abandons them. Because of that, it feels soulless, nothing but a pantomime of the original.I think that the primary plot failing is that ""Blade Runner 2049"" lays itself bare. We know right from the start who is a replicant and who is human. This strips out the heart of what (to me) makes Blade Runner special: the questioning of what it actually means to be human and the juxtaposition of humans acting like androids and androids acting with selfless humanity. Very little of that is to be found in this film.Walking out, I was left scratching my head at what themes they actually were trying to get at here. None are readily apparent. So it ends up being a cool looking, atmospheric action/sci-fi flick. That's makes it a good movie, but doesn't make it a ""masterpiece.""People still talk about the original ""Blade Runner,"" 30 years after it's release. Nobody will be talking about this movie when the year 2049 actually rolls around."
174," The best movie I've seen in a long time.
","Seriously, this might have topped my favorite movies. The transition from the original is seamless and unprecedented; despite the time that's passed both in and out of the movie it feels as if you're stepping in to their reality, something that feels both magical and close enough to our own to feel tangible. Really such a beautiful movie in every way. The soundtrack, cinematography, dialogue, direction, I literally couldn't criticize a single thing. I can't say enough, especially without eluding to the plot, but I wholeheartedly recommend this film; not just as an adequate sequel, but in my honest opinion, a movie that has surpassed the original. If you can, please go see it in the theater; it really amplifies the beautifully done atmosphere of this astounding movie.That said, fair warning to those with seizure disorders, you may want to consider waiting to view this at home. There is a scene in the movie that lasts... maybe five to ten minutes(?) that caused me to have two seizures. It's a great scene, but there are strobing lights that could be potentially triggering, so please be careful."
175," If the original Blade Runner was a classic, the 2049 sequel is a masterpiece
","Superior to the original Blade Runner, and one of the best scifi films for both scifi fans and non-fans alike. I just rewatched the original Blade Runner last night so this is not a comparison based on distant memories. The sequel has a richer but also more approachable and understandable story, better acting and cast, and even better cinematography and music. Must see! Don't be scared away by the weak box office results or long run-time."
176," Don't watch. Completely waste of time.
",Movie is too long. Story is way too simple. Maybe the director think there is twist but it is definitely not. A bit of everything while not successful in any part of it. Using CGI in sex part. How it is relevant to the story? Sony logo is everywhere. A completely waste of time. Don't watch it.
177," regular Hollywood crap disguised as ""a masterpiece"".
","i will give it 3 for the efforts in beautiful design and shooting.ALL THE REST - directing, script, characters, music, editing - BAD BAD BAD.seriously - go watch the 3 shorts they done to promote this. they are way better.let me dig deeper: directing - i respected and trusted Hollywood's wonder boy, villeneuve - until now. this heavy load of a responsibility was not for him. he fails in delivering the true gritty vibe needed for this. i bet his hands got tied with the studio, they probably changed editing, script etc, and he bailed out. creating a beautiful CGI world is not enough, sorry.script - starts interesting and after 20 minutes turns into usual empty, soulless, Hollywood of today's blockbusters. nothing feels genuine, all is explained a few times, for us dumb audience. the story is so simple, and the script stretches it so it all fails. it's not smart, not tight, not intelligent. it's bad. characters - flat and hollow. they all feel unnatural (OPPOSITE of the original), delivering the performance that is ""needed"", no more. Ford pops up for a minimum effort (almost like ""the Force Awakens""), and is nothing like Deckard's original character. pathetic. the Leto character is a cardboard villain. and of course Gosling. what an excuse for playing a stiff android. terrible.music - Zimmer's usual Inception trademark. the lowest point was using ""Tears In Rain"" which is the most beautiful Vangelis tune ever, and used it in the ending to squeeze some fake emotion from us. can't believe villeneuve agreed to this crap. editing - by editing i mean - take 30 min. off this, even an hour. lose many unneeded parts. shorten all scenes. at least people will be able to enjoy a bit of eye candy instead of suffering.the first film is very good IMO. go watch any scene in YT to remember how much better it is. quality sci-fi at it's best.the word ""masterpiece"" is mentioned regarding the new film. so don't believe it. you won't miss any ""subtleties"" as the ""worsheepers"" of this crap say. there aren't. if this film settles on a 7 rating, it should be an honor."
178," Failure as sequel, failure as stand-alone.
","** Warning! Here May Be Spoilers, for this movie and others. ** The original Blade Runner evoked a strong feeling: I might be manufactured by others, but it doesn't invalidate my identify. My experiences are singular and I feel them deeply. However I got here, I am real.Blade Runner 2049 starts with an alienated second-class citizen craving that validated authenticity. His story is derailed by side issues -- his owner/operator's problems, corporate drama, a sort of love interest, profit motive, the Resistance, (pseudo-)scientific posturing, and other irrelevancies. By the end, when the story has gone in a different direction entirely, our hero just lies down and gives up, and us with him.Specifics: Pacing / Story / Characters: BR2049 is too long and way too slow. There is no point or purpose, no golden narrative thread. Overall it watches like the boring parts of Matrix movies, eliminated from the supercut and reworked for a different color palette. Ryan Gosling is Neo, Jared Leto plays The Architect, Carla Juri is the Oracle, Edward James Olmos is The Keymaker...the parallels don't stop there. Yawn.Dialogue: the pretentious, vaguely ominous, Messianic BS that put you to sleep in the Matrix sequels has been refurbished for our sad, hunky Pinocchio in his futuristic pimp coat.Deckard: his part begins with a Disneyfied sequence a la ""Cowboys & Aliens"" including cheesy wisecracks and a rough-and-tumble meet-cute, which ends unceremoniously with an ""I'm too old for this"" surrender. The sequence takes place in a post-apocalyptic Las Vegas that has occasional funny parts (which I hope were unintentionally funny rather than failed attempts at comic relief for non-existent tension.) After investing so much time in Ryan Gosling and his story, the focus shifts to Deckard, who isn't himself away from LA, and whose tacked-on storyline hijacks the movie. (Regret: The lost years of Deckard and Rachael with the Replicant Resistance underground should have been a separate movie.) Here, Deckard starts as comic relief and ends as a plot device to move the story to some kind of conclusion. There is some emotional button-pushing for fans of the original (oh, Rachael!) and a tired attempt at emotional manipulation (getting to know the child we had no idea you'd ever wanted but for that one line a few minutes ago.)Costumes: there are no costumes, styles, or fashion. Only clothes.A/V: there are lovely, lingering shots of what appear to be abandoned Brutalist / Eastern Bloc / doomsday cult headquarters blanketed in untouched snow. There is gorgeous, impersonal CGI. There are building-high images of beautiful naked women, blandly presented and titillation-free. The music includes watery variations on the original score, interspersed with sinus-clearing brown noise.(I will probably buy this movie for those location shots, quiet stills, and long, honking chords. I even want the music. But it's sad that the kernel notes of Vangelis, so precise and delicate, shine out purely even as their impact is bled away by the insubstantial context of the movie and the score.) In contrast, I saw the sequel as a double feature with the remastered original, which took on new richness in the cinema setting. The original is a quick sit, modeled after rogue cop film noir: vibrant characters, clear narrative purpose, a stunning moll, gritty romance, and a getaway ending with a crystallized message. The sequel is pointless, diluted, internally inconsistent, and slow.In Blade Runner 2049, people cry All.The.Time. -- and now you know why."
179," Garbage.
",The only saving grace for this mince is that Ana De Armas is in it. All you fools who are just discovering her know nothing. She's a goddess. FACT!
180," A visually stunning return to the world of Blade Runners and replicants
","Thirty years after the events portrayed in the original film Blade Runners are still hunting down rogue replicants; this time Nexus 8 models who have no expiry date. Newer models are considered safer as they must obey orders. One such newer model is 'K', a blade runner whose existence is thrown into turmoil after bones are found at the home of a Nexus 8 he 'retired'. They show evidence of something thought impossible; something that if made public could undermine the peace between humanity and replicants. He is tasked with ensuring that the most important evidence of what happened is destroyed... in the process he learns more about himself and eventually meets Deckard. He isn't the only person searching; the Wallace Corporation, successors to Tyrell are searching too.I've kept my plot synopsis as vague as possible to avoid any potential spoilers even though some of the main revelations come early in the film. The story is enjoyable; I liked how it added to the original without being more of the same. For the most part the characters are new and interesting as are the advances in technology. Ryan Gosling impressed as K; it was interesting to have a lead character who was undeniable a replicant but still had a degree of mystery about him. It was great seeing Harrison Ford return as Deckard even if the character isn't in the film for as long as one might expect; there was also a fun cameo from Edward James Olmos as Gaff. Of the other characters the three most interesting were all women; Ana de Armas, who delighted as K's holographic girlfriend Joi; Sylvia Hoeks; who was impressive as Luv, an enforcer for the Wallace Corporation and Robin Wright who is solid as K's superior Lt. Joshi. As well as being interesting the film is visually stunning with fantastic special effects and a very impressive design. The film isn't perfect of course; some scenes go on a bit too long meaning the film is quite a bit longer than it really needs to be... still I was really impressed overall and would definitely recommend it to fans of the original."
181," Perfect mix of futuristic scenery, engrossing soundscapes, drama, action and melancholy
","I've now seen BR 2049 two times: First in IMAX and then in a Sony 4k theater. Both times, sound was truly fantastic and imagery was breathtaking. This truly is a masterpiece of futuristic cinematography with matching music and sound.Being a huge fan of the original Blade Runner (especially the Final Cut), I had feared disappointment. But BR 2049 exceeded my wildest expectations. The bleak, rainy atmosphere of future LA from the first movie was rendered beautifully. The landscapes in the other locations was equally awe-inspiring. And the new soundtrack, while somehow understated and perhaps less melodic, reaches a few wonderful climaxes where it reverts back to the original Vangelis themes.I am also delighted by the slow pace. Finally a science fiction movie that gives me time to take all the impressive imagery in. I was engrossed the whole time.I loved how BR 2049 expands on the original story line. Answering questions, while adding a new twist that truly makes us think about the meaning and value of artificial life. And then finally there's the delight of seeing Deckard again. Now an old man, scarred by sacrifice and impossible love. And finally, the film's climax grabbed me emotionally just like the original did during the ""tears in rain"" scene.For me this is now one of twelve movies I've rated 10/10. Awesome."
182," Loved most of it!
","I'm a big fan of Denis Villeneuve so I almost had a coronary when I heard he was directing the new Bladerunner sequel. The first thing I loved about 2049 was the atmosphere the filmmakers managed to create, which carried on nicely from the first movie - the connection was almost tangible. The imagery was breathtakingly beautiful and I thought the sound design and music were incredibly impressive. Ryan Gosling fit the main part perfectly and I loved the aura Villeneuve managed to create around him. The only two little criticisms I had was 1) the Jared Leto character was a tad boring and 2) as a young woman, I found the hologram scenes hard to watch at times (but this is possibly just my taste and not necessarily a fault of the film itself). All in all, it's a very good sequel - certainly one of the best I've seen."
183," A masterpiece for our time, a reflection of our future
","Bladerunner 2049, like the original, is a concept art movie whose DNA is pure introspection wrapped tightly in a silk of ambiance. Various other movies have attempted to introspect on what it means to be human... What humanity is... Bladerunner is among the best of those, but it doesn't stop with just that question. When you analyze the Bladerunner movies together you find yourself sensing metaphors and symbols and outright injections of racism, sexism, elitism, commercialism, and ""isms"" I haven't even thought of; exploitation, environmental negligence, invasion of privacy, neglect, police corruption, and abuse of power. It was a frightening glimpse at ourselves today, at our inner nature, at fears ranging from xenophobia to claustrophobia to phobias that haven't been invented yet. Those are the negative things, but you can also find human ingenuity, art, innocence, and the need for love and nostalgia, all but lost like tears in the rain. The pacing of the movie was ponderous because it needed you to digest all of this brain food and eye candy, and it used the music and sound effects and visual effects to keep your attention. The music helped to glue you to the thoughts the movie was injecting you with - and some of them were on the level of subliminal advertising.It remained consistent with the original movie, in continuity with the atmospheric theme but allowing us a more diverse glimpse outside the urban waste-cage and the clutch of overpopulation. But there is no improvement to be found outside the city: it is a lonely place with or without the crowds. The barren desert landscapes, the angry ocean waters, the garbage heaps of San Diego littered with desperate children, and the decadent remains of a sepia-baked Las Vegas were no improvements, and yet the eyes drink it all. The assault of personal space and by unregulated advertisement and human debauchery that sticks to you in like filthy grime was set in stark contrast with a distinct isolation on the outside, no better and no worse, and all welded together with stunning sounds. Both Bladerunner movies are a war between perfection and imperfection: our struggle to create a perfect world for ourselves results in a world decidedly imperfect. This is a world- build set on the unstable ground of organic, cultural, technological and industrial blemishes, the kind we turn our eyes from and pretend they don't exist. Watch both movies and you find yourself buried in things that fail or do not work quite right... Shorting out, dying, rotting, falling into disrepair, scraped up, beaten up... It is the future through the lens of today, rather than through the rosy glasses of yesteryear.There are scenes in the Bladerunner movies (and others) in which the characters really aren't doing anything but thinking or taking a journey. The plot doesn't move and the characters don't develop. When that's done on purpose (see Under the Skin for more-than-enough of that technique) and when the actors and Director of Photography and Sound Designer and Composer aren't on board with what the director is trying to do, it fails. Even if they ARE on board it could fail, so it's a risky art, especially with an enormous amount of studio money, in a system where the studio people can intercede to ""protect"" their investment. I felt that this cut could use a little trimming here and there, as we lingered on a person thinking for a few seconds too many, or waiting (without any suspense) for Deckard to finally say, ""Rachel,"" and as I waited, in my mind that police loudspeaker was saying: ""Move-on... Move-on... Movie-on...""The question of Deckard's humanity, and the ambiguity that drives everyone to debate it, is the metaphor of ourselves. He is the ""everyman."" What makes us human? Aren't' we all machines, striving for perfection, losing to imperfection, tangled in a war against death for a life of despair we can't seem to win? The unicorn has been used in mythology to symbolize the incarnation of Christ, able to bring back the dead and offer immortality. It did not make an appearance in the second movie. Or did it?"
184," Blade Runner 2019
","I just returned home from the movie and I know I shall go back there again next week and then, I shall fight not to relate it to the original (which is the difficult part) , I shall relax a few times sleeping (I know when), I shall comment on the movie to my companion to avoid paying attention to the tears, so finally, I shall enjoy the best science fiction movie ever made since 1982."
185," Sigh. Hollywood will never learn.
","Suffice it to say, I consider the original to be one of the defining moments of sci-fi cinema, and I love the book it was based as well ('Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?' for those of you unfamiliar).There is simply no reason for this movie to exist. Even putting aside that fact, this is not the film that should have attempted to carry on that non-existent legacy. This is yet another Hollywood attempt to cash in on the nostalgia generation with a soulless excuse for a film that occasionally hits the right triggers. It is very well made, but seriously: what isn't in the 21st century? That just can't be used as a qualifier anymore (for proof, see how well made Bollywood films are these days). If anything, in this era of effortless movie magic, even MORE emphasis will fall on things like story, direction, etc. to carry a film. Blade Runner 2049 falls short in every single one of these areas. It is boring. It is inconsistent. It is in no way an extension of what made the original great. I'm sure Harrison ford was paid handsomely, and that is all he cared about. I can't really recommend it to anyone. Even as a standalone film it is plodding, boring, over-long, forgettable. If you want a classic, see the original with the understanding that its impact was perhaps more profound during the era in which it was released. Afterward, accept that it was the end and pretend this pile of poo doesn't exist. Supremely disappointing, shame on you yet again, Hollywood. There isn't a single, tiny shred of originality, integrity, or courage left amid those palms."

187," An unnecessary sequel
","There are some movies that get made that should never be diluted by a sequel. This movie is one of them. Following in the footsteps of his absolutely terrible Arrival (The aliens don't understand our concept of time. Five minutes later it's we'll be back for your help in 3000 years). Dennis Villaneuve's Blade Runner 2049 is too long, too dull and too derivative of the original. A sequel that's based on what I feel is a lame story line (which I can't give away simply because it's a major spoiler). While the look of the film is in line with the original, if not dirtier, the movie itself really goes nowhere. I can see why it bombed at the theaters. It really isn't for anyone who's not a fan of the original. It's another in Ridley Scott's recent line of failures (even though he only produced it. It want's to be a smart movie, but honestly, the only smart movie I've seen recently is Ex Machina, which was brilliant, something this movie isn't. There are parts that were interesting, but overall the entire film just plods from scene to scene. Ryan Gosling's inability to emote doesn't help this. Nor does waiting nearly 2/3rds of a too long run time for Harrison Ford's Rick Deckard to show up. I have to say that I wasn't looking forward to this film and now that I've seen it, I'm disappointed."
188," A waste of 3 hours of my life
","This is the first review I have written for a movie and the reason I am writing this is because this is the worst movie I have ever seen. About 45 minutes into the movie I asked my husband if he understood what was going on and he did not either. Not only is it difficult to understand what is going on, but it is dark and slow. (many scenes of the characters holding their hand out into the fake snow, looking at their hands. or long shots of the characters staring off into space.) The only color in the movie occurred for about 30 seconds when green leaves were shown as a memory flashback. The gentleman next to us also agreed he was glad it was over. I suppose that it gets high reviews because of the special effects, but without a story line that is interesting and engaging, special effects do nothing for me."
189," Master Mess of a Movie!
","This film is garbage.Over long, muddled, confused, boring, with no likable characters.The story-as far as I can decipher-relates to a woeful future time when replicants/robots seek to destroy earlier models.But of course the film tries to dictate to us that there being no substitute for humans... the problem with that preaching is that it was, I assume, a human who made this total nonsense of a movie!What is just as bad as the blandness of this picture is that many so called professional film reviewers are writing treatises etc., on how wonderful is this film.The fact- as opposed to the science fiction- is that this flick is a disaster and an abject mess:1/10"
190," A Masterpiece of Cinematography, but quite boring.
","I watched this movie at 9 PM and I've been asleep for 1 minute during a scene. Its not because the movie is bad, but simply there's nothing happened in that 1 minute and I could follow the story quickly after I wake up, also the scenery is calm and beautiful, perfect for a quiet little nap. Its not a movie for you to enjoy the story (even the story is fantastic) but more like to enjoy the cinematography, as a Graphic Designer, I will definitely recommend this movie as a masterpiece reference.As I say, the story is fantastic, but filled really slow. We have some minutes to think about the problem and try to solve it ourselves before the movie brings us the truth. So, its a movie to enjoy, for you to analyze every little detail and they give you a couple of time for that. The actors play nicely (and I adore Ryan Gosling and Jared Leto for such long time), and its not your typical Hollywood movie."

Officer K's discovery tends to be just part of a major quest to find a former LAPD blade runner, Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) , who appears to be in self-imposed exile for the last thirty years. Stunning to look at, but at times tedious. Holding things together is a soundtrack featuring Hans Zimmer & Benjiman Wallfisch, Lauren Daigle, Frank Sinatra and Elvis Presley. Dennis Villeneuve directs a cast led by: Robin Wright, Ana de Armas, Dave Bautista, Jared Leto, Sylvia Hoeks, Edward James Olmos, David Dastmalchian and Sean Young."
195," More than human...
","""Blade Runner 2049"" is visually stunning like nothing you've been before with the opaque orange sky of the industrial ravaged future Earth, and its vivid gaudy neon holographic skyline at night. Director Denis Villeneuve and Executive Producer Ridley Scott, who directed the original ""Blade Runner"", are more provocative inquiry, ""What is it to be human?"" At a narrative arc Ryan Gosling's blue eyes widen welled with tears as his Replicant LAPD Officer K says, ""It's real!"" K realizes that his implanted childhood memory is real. But whose is it? His? Villenueve and cinematographer Roger Deakins's ""Blade Runner 2049"" is the masterfully sublime futuristic mural that unconceals the compelling and flawed inquiry of humanity in the screenplay by Hampton Francher and Michael Green, based on the Philip K. Dick novel. Ryan Gosling and Harrison Ford as the returning aged Deckard are awesome. Gosling commands as K in his profound stillness and compassion which betrays his character's human design. He tells his LAPD superior Lt. Joshi, played by powerful Robin Wright, that being born gives one a soul. She acknowledges him, ""You've done just fine without one."" ""Blade Runner 2049"" surprises, because of Gosling's courage in finding K's purpose, his soul. Gosling and Ford have amazing chemistry and partnership. Ford brings a world weary gravitas. K finally locates the recluse retired Blade Runner Deakard (Ford), who possesses vital information of this Replicant conspiracy and his own past. Deakard tells K, ""Sometimes when you love someone, you got to be a stranger."" What is real?Replicants are the synthetic genetically engineered humans, not born, created as the expendable work force. In 2049 Wallace Industries assumes the production of Replicants, who are designed with great physical strength and enhanced intellectual capacity. Jared Leto plays the enigmatic blind CEO Niander Wallace. Leto has the quiet, yet malevolent enlightened air. Wallace says, ""Every civilization was built on the back of a disposable workforce, but I can make only so many."" He arrogantly believes he is doing God's work. Blade Runners like K retire or kill rogue Replicants, who are deemed dangerous. Part of K's curse is that he too, is Replicant. ""2049"" opens as K tracks down Replicant agro farmer Sapper Morton, played by quiet hulking Dave Bautista. Their vicious battle reveals K's unique strength and resilience. However, this Replicant ""retirement"" reveals the unheard of. There may exist, a child born of a Replicant mother. Lt. Joshi (Wright) has K pursue this investigation at Wallace Industries. K meets the forceful and beautiful Replicant Luv, played by astonishing charismatic Sylvia Hoeks, Wallace's executive in charge. K's questions threaten, and Luv surmises that K must be terminated. Villeneuve eloquently orchestrates their defining conflict. Inadvertently, Luv's reveal cues K to locate Deakard (Ford). In the backdrop, K lives the isolated existence. His love is the sad and beautiful holographic program Joi, played by captivating Ana de Armas. Joi is the sentient program wishing to be human to be with K. This is the weakest movie narrative. The virtual m√©nage of K, Joi, and Replicant prostitute Mariett, strong pretty Mackenzie Davis, is more a hollow plot device than about human frailty. Too bad. In the telling confession with Deakard and Wallace in his Zen-like lair, Wallace says to Deakard of his deceased Replicant love Rachel, ""Love or mathematical precision?"" What is it to be human? That gets lost at times. As Luv, Hoek's consumed ruthlessness, fierce intellect, and spinning sidekicks provide the formidable match for Gosling's enduring warrior K. Luv's purpose is self preservation of her kind. K's purpose is far nobler. He searches for the truth, and protects those who are weaker. K may not be entirely human, yet he becomes Hero. This narrative thread and the performances make ""Blade Runner 2049"" special. Aside from Harrison Ford, Carla Juri stands out as the gentle brilliant orphaned Scientist who created K's memories. She is bright light with a profound sadness. ""Blade Runner 2024"" also has a sense of sadness which is its strength and poignancy. Villeneuve surprises in the end. Then we recall that even in the darkness, ""Blade Runner 2024"" is the Hero story of K and Deakard. Gosling and Ford give their best here, and we are thankful, the better for it."

","What I have just seen in my nearby theater was what I think is one of the greatest films of all time. Denis Villeneuve and his crew have created a film so artistically and visually beautiful that there's no way this movie was made by humans. Roger Deakins has not won an Oscar. Think about that. One of the most renowned cinematographers of all time? Screw him. Well, not anymore. He WILL win an Academy Award for this cinematography. There is no denying that. Villeneuve has made some of the best films of this decade, and this is just another one. Prisoners, Enemy, Sicario, and Arrival? He is one of the best directors working today. This film is the best he's ever done. This movie is a true masterpiece of cinema. Everything that was cool about Blade Runner was made even better in this Big-Budge sequel. There are many surprises waiting, and trust me, you will be surprised. The visual effects in this film are comparably revolutionary to Terminator 2's.They are spectacular and realistic. The crew held true and payed plenty of homage to the original 1982 classic. But this film is better in every way. Not many people can make a FILM this amazing today. I might see this in theaters 12 more times. IT IS THAT GOOD! I've been waiting for this sequel ever since it was announced, and after the initial press reviews, I was expecting something stunning, but what I experienced was a movie that was so spellbinding and perfect that I cannot help but say that Blade Runner 2049 is one of the best films ever made."
197," What went wrong?
","I have to admit, as a true Blade Runner fan, I was very skeptical about this movie. As soon as I heard Dennis Villeneuve, Ridley Scott and Harrison Ford would be involved in the process, I began to smile. Especially after seeing the great movie 'Arrival' last year, I was rather confident the legacy of this true, one and only SF-masterpiece would be in great hands. After seeing the movie last night, my worst fears did come true. Blade Runner 2049 is nothing more than a disaster,judging by it's story. True, all the visuals are STUNNING, Deakins did a great job in creating the dystopian world (again) to the screen. The movie is just too long, and the return of Deckard just adds nothing to the story. Ford also failed in portraying Deckard, to me his performance did not echoed the first film, I thought I saw him playing that old Solo again. But the true moment of disgrace, the true error, lies in it's ending. As a true Blade Runner fan, a fan of Rutger Hauers performance, it's just unbelievable how all these people from the first movie made these artistic decisions in this (unwanted) sequel. Maybe they all just tried a little to hard to lift the great legacy of the first movie, but just failed in doing so because of it's artistic heaviness. Like I wrote, the true error lies in it's ending. It left me stunned, gasping for breath after watching Gosling on the stairs, snow begins to fall and we hear the first tunes of Vangelis Tears in Rain. . Unbelieve, it ruined the movie totally. I just don't get it: how is it possible that Scott / Villeneuve made this awful scene? Totally disgraceful! A true slap in the face of that great scene, that one and only historic scene showing Batty on the roof, the monologue every die-hard movie buff will always remember. I'm just lost for words, such a shame.."
198," Pretentious, slow and boring
","I wasn't sure what to expect from this movie, but I didn't expect awful. I'm old enough to remember the original movie which was innovative and interesting. Most of the acting in the original was stellar and it wasn't gimmicky. I can't say the same for this sequel (which might just be a set up for a third unfortunately). Ryan Goslings character was interesting, most of the other replicants were not. Jared Leto's character was just annoying. Robin Wright's small but interesting part was maybe the highlight of the whole film. You notice I haven't said much about Harrison Ford who is Indiana Jones old man mode.The most annoying part of the was the visuals and the music (at least I this that's what they're calling it). I though of 2001 Space Odessy but that music was actually good. It was suppose to post-war California but the sets were so dark you couldn't see the characters. In one scene I kept thinking of Mad Max and not Blade Runner. Totally a missed opportunity to make an interesting sequel."
199," Not What I Thought It Would Be, But Wonderful, Nonetheless!
","The movie was not what I expected, but it was captivating. It was, complex, intriguing and mesmerizing - keeping my attention focused through the entire 2 hours and 44 minutes. I felt the movie left the viewer wondering if they plan on a third installment - they certainly could go that way.The one thing I felt sorely lacking was the music. The soundtrack in the original Blade Runner was an integral part of the ambiance; the soul and heart of the film. When I hear the music from the original soundtrack, I am immediately transported to a scene, a moment seared forever in my memory, another place and time surreal to our present world. The original soundtrack by Vangelis was haunting, unique - it was the heartbeat of the movie, like blood flowing through the body, the music flowed through the film, imbuing it with a life of its own.Acting was top-notch. The sets and imagery were outstanding, immersing the viewer in the world of 2049. Just as with the first movie, there were enough plot twists, questions left unanswered - while other questions were answered, but done so that the viewer was left with more uncertainty.And what of the dog? :-)"
200," Exhausting
","That Ridley Scott had anything to do with this is a surprise. The music: what music?The sound effects? Every bump and nose wipe was a 10 on the theater sound system Richter scale. A little subtlety would go a long way in improving every aspect of the effects. A good story? Please.The interminable ""dramatic"" hold scene?. Good grief. They made up half the screen time.The story? It's finally revealed in the last half hour as a remake of the Da Vinci Code. And poorly. Sorry guys. How this got an IMDb rating of 8.7 on day one is as big a mystery as, well, anything in the last 8 months of life in the USA. Yuk."
201," Doesn't hold a candle to the original.
","The original Bladerunner was a sci-fi noir classic, it had a mysterious and magical aura about it. Everything from the plot, sets, the classic Vangelis score and the meticulous level of detail was just sublime. This *cough* sequel *cough* is not even in the same ball park stylistically, story wise or in any other way. It felt cold and lacked the originals ambiance and magical tone,moved like molasses and the overly convoluted and sleep inducing story made me stare at the walls and other patrons to see if they were still awake. Hollywood has lost the plot literally and figuratively and it just goes to show that bigger budgets and fancier CGI do not make a superior film.They just don't make em' like they used to."
202," slow, boring, non-acting, non-verbal disappointment
","I would implore people to really consider what type of movie they like before going to see this one. The slowness of the movie and non-verbal communication and overall ""take 5 minutes to illustrate what usually can be done effectively and more atmospherically in 30seconds to 1min"" is absolutely rampant in this movie. Ryan Gosling is wooden and hardly communicates, the Harrison Ford addition is also mediocre. It's quite simple, i ended up walking out of the movie as did 20-25% of the entire audience. Overall the most disappointing movie i have seen in years ... it could have been so, so, so much more!"
203," Boring disjointed story with visuals rehashed from original
","It was a mental sufferfest to watch this to the end. The original movie was exciting and flowed. This movie was all over the place, almost like there was a massive fight in the cutting room and what they ended up with was submitted to meet a deadline .I saw it in 3D as well but I found the visual fx were just OK. Nothing out of the ordinary.I'm wondering where they spent the money here. I would advise them to spend it on an expert story 'fixer' next time rather than release this tosh!In a word: awful."
204," All those generic movies will be lost in time like tears in the rain. This is not one of those movies.
","Blade Runner 2049 is a sequel to a 1982 dystopian sci-fi classic Blade Runner. It's directed by incredible Dennis Villenueve (Arrival, Prisoners, Sicario, Enemy, I think I said enough) and stars Ryan Gosling, Jared Leto and Harrison Ford who is returning here. I'm not going to tell you anything about the plot because I find it better going into it blind, so I will get to my thoughts on this.I've heard a lot of people call the first one overrated, but I love each and every cut of it, so I guess you can say I was pretty hyped for this. And with the talent attached to it, my expectations were nothing short of great. And this movie actually managed to live up to those expectations. I've had a blast watching this. I have so much more respect for Sony now because it took bravery to put this much effort and money in what's essentially a big budget art film. Don't go into it expecting an action movie. The trailers might sell it as one, but there is only one longer action scene at the end. I'd say even the first one had more action. But, that doesn't take away from the movie. I just sat there in the theater and sunk into this gorgeous movie. If you love neon lights with a soundtrack filled with synths like I do, just go for it, you will love it. Visually, it's one of the most gorgeous movies I've ever seen, if not the most gorgeous. It also gave us more of this world that's disgusting and so beautiful at the same time and one that you can just get lost in. Loneliness and isolation are one of the major themes here (as the depression that comes with it) and the world is like a reflection of that. It's very slow, but the slow pace adds a lot of depth here. Honestly, I wish it was longer. There's quite a lot of ambiguity (don't expect to get much answers to the questions from the first one) and some loose ends left in the plot. But they are left by the subplots. And those subplots are not our lead's story. They only helped drive his story and it makes sense that they were unfinished. It might bother some, but it didn't bother me. It's like that for a reason. Who knows, we might even get another one. If they continue like this, I'm all in for it.I wish they make more movies like this. Because this was brilliant and now it left me wanting more. I still don't know if I prefer this or the first one because both are kinda their own movies and I love them both equally in different ways. It's a slow- burn, but a very enjoyable and beautiful slow-burn."
205," Simply, a masterpiece
","After 35 years Blade Runner is back! This time it's directed by Denis Villeneuve, the man behind Prisoners, Sicario and Arrival. Writer Hampton Fancher returns to the franchise to helm the screenplay along with Michael Green. The film is set in 2049 were a new Blade Runner, officer K (Ryan Gosling), is hunting the few remaining Tyrell replicants. However when a secret is uncovered, K no longer is the hunter. He has become the hunted. In the leading roles we have Ryan Gosling as the new Blade Runner, officer K. He is a brilliant addition to the universe and serves as a very compelling character. The performance by Gosling is also great, as expected from an actor of his caliber. Harrison Ford makes his triumphant return to the franchise and unlike his performance in the original, which could be considered one of his weakest, Ford gives his one of his best ever performances. He is also great when on screen with Gosling. The pair have a good chemistry and are very entertaining to watch. In the other roles we have Ana de Armas, Jared Leto, Robin Wright and Sylvia Hoeks, all great performances. At the center of this story we have the classic Blade Runner themes, life, death and it's meaning. Those aspects are definitely the originals strength. My biggest flaw with the original has always been it's love story, which is mainly down to the lack of chemistry between Sean Young and Ford. However in 2049 we have one of the strongest and most emotionally powerful love stories i have seen in a very long time. It's fits perfectly and enhances the overall story. Roger Deakins is one of the greatest cinematographers of all time and his work here is perhaps his best. Blade Runner: 2049 is one of the most beautiful films of all time, thank's to the great, Roger Deakins. It really has to be experienced on the biggest screen possible. His work here can only be considered, art. All the above mentioned factors combine, under the direction of Villeneuve, to become one of the truly, greatest sequels of all time and therefor one of the best films overall. I can't find a flaw with this film and therefor i will not hesitate to call it a masterpiece. Is it better than the original? I really can't say. But what i can say is that i won't compare them. Blade Runner 2049 is a complete movie that can stand on it's own and be great. I won't compare the two because they are both masterpieces in there own right. To fully experience Blade Runner: 2049, seek out the biggest screen you can and let Denis Villeneuve transport you back to the world of Blade Runner! Final Rating: 10/10‚≠êÔ∏è"
206," Sensical continuation
",Very well done and well thought. A few twists as to where it was heading give it value. Not lyrical and ground breaking like the first was. Replicants are much too perfect. Their imperfections of bodies and mind made the first much more intriguing and unpredictable.
207," Too long and boring
","Went into work at 7am to work extra time so i could go along to this today and i now regret it.It was too long, boring, i didn't really care if deckard found his daughter or care what jared leto's point was in all of it.The CGI for Sean Young's part was one of the poorer attempts.My biggest complaint was this movie could have easily have been 90minutes, 2hr40+mins was excruciatingly long.3/10 not worth watching."
208," Blade Runner 2049: The middle east of movies
","When you think it can't get any worse, it will. You see it, right in front of you. You know it's there and it is happening but you can't do anything about it, as much as you want to, besides watching it. This was the most dull movie I have seen this year. In fact, the only feeling of excitement I achieved from this movie was when I got surprised about how much worse it could get and I felt relieved when the credits rolled. I really tried to get into it. Really tried getting that special connection with the characters and the story but it seemed like everyone involved in this movie just wanted to get it over with. As a huge childhood fan of Indiana Jones and Star Wars, I'm sad to ask Hollywood to let Harrison Ford rest in piece.I did not find anything to like in the two hours I was sitting in the cinema, besides the popcorn on my lap. The sounds and the timing of them were misplaced, the whole plot was portrayed badly. Speaking of the plot, it's sort of like a little kinder garden boy making a mug for his dad. It's a great idea and a very awesome thing to do but in all honesty, the end result is food for the garbage bin. It was obvious they used good old Ford to make this movie more relevant to gain a bigger audience and that's a sad sight. I don't believe none of us want to see people used up and thrown away but they need to leave Harrison Ford alone. They shouldn't have brought him in the title as he was just as relevant as Batista who appears and dies within the first few minutes of the movie. Sorry but this was just awful."
209," Blade Runner 2049; a highly disappointing and unnecessary sequel.
","It hurts to write this review. It really does. Because this was one of the 2017 movie releases that had me filled with most anticipation and excitement. I could not wait to see it as I had spent many hours in the 80s and 90s re-watching the original Blade Runner with my older sibling. I could not wait to see the dark post-apocalyptic, and very magical poetry, from the predecessor being revived and brought to life yet again. But wow, what a let down. I see the 10/10 reviews on IMDb and all I can think is 'did these people really watch the same film' ... 'are they mistakenly reviewing the 80s film'??? Because Blade Runner 2049 is not worth 10 out of 10. It is so far from perfection, it is to be honest, a completely unnecessary sequel that I could have been without.I don't like to give away plots because in case you haven't seen the BR 2049 it might spoil what little intrigue this movie managed to whisk up. So I won't mention the first (and one of the few) 'hey, I didn't see that coming!' moments (which unfortunately comes along about 5minutes into the film and then it drags until the next). As the plot SLOWLY (oh so slowly) unfolds we are supposed to be wowed I guess. Gosling does his blade runner thing and stumbles upon a box, buried with some deep secrets. He then drives around (a lot) looking for clues and trying to crack this case. And the plot deepens, supposedly. So Gosling drives around some more. Talking (a lot of talking) to a few characters, many of them with such stilted acting that it leaves much to wish for. Seriously waiting for something to actually happen now! The original Blade Runner might not be classed as an action movie but there are a few very memorable fight scenes that has stuck with me for 30 years... Daryl Hannah posing as a doll for example - masterpiece and classic scene! We get none of that in the sequel. Instead we get Jared Leto rambling and babbling and making me completely losing the thread, and the interest. By now I am looking at my watch wondering how long there might be left of the movie. And this is only halfway in. Snooze. Turning to my fellow cinema goer, and whoops there you go, he is actually asleep in his seat. Not the work of a 10/10 movie I'll tell you that!So on it goes. More driving. More talking. More clues. We get a few explosions and minor twists and turns. The only saving grace of the movie is the soundtrack. It is messing with your head all on its own, going from tranquil to a kick in the gut in seconds. Loved it. The scenery is alright. But if you have seen the original film then this one doesn't really add anything new. There is none of the wow factors from seeing the dark and the grit, mixed with the futuristic Asian red light district feel, for the very first time in the 80s. They did it so well then. Now, well there's more neon lights and flying cars. But we seen those before...So what else can I say... The movie drags on. Harrison Ford jumps into the mix (too late but still a saving grace). We get a little bit of action. Jared Leto babbles some more. Futuristic car chase. The conclusion draws near. And yep there it is, revealed in a quick 'Gosling puts the puzzle pieces together in his head while we get fast-paced jump cuts of what we have already seen in the movie' - and done. 2hours and 44 minutes later the audience is served a lukewarm ending that screams Blade Runner part III. And that made me angry. The original movie ends with Rutger Hauer's beautiful monologue in the rain. Now that is movie magic. This, well this is the box office talking, or shouting in your face rather. 4 out 10. And best acting performance goes to the dog!"
210," Too Long
","No story and slow. Contradictory development.
No more replicants. Just living beings. Ha??Go to Vimeo and watch the slim waist of the hologram. That is all you need."
211," Watch the original (1982)
","Good visual, music and ambiance, but nothing revolutionary in it. In general, a shallow attempt to replicate the original by reshuffling its elements and putting them into a clich√© blockbuster frame. Adds no new meaning, except explaining what happened in the old movie (for those of us who did not get it i guess).Acting is average, dialogues are shallow and meaningless towards the end, long pauses are a torture. Seems they are trying to stretch the screen time. A lot of evident product placement."
212," Pathetic. Blade Runner for the new generation is as flawed as any other modern Hollywood movie.
","The original Blade Runner was a film primarily about visuals, it was not surprising that in the early 1980s, Ridley Scott had no rival in the visual department. Blade Runner was mostly a visual movie, with little or no character development. It was a rich film about culture and visual aesthetics. The film was pioneer enough to influence several generations of filmmakers, but also about TV series, anime, among others about a futuristic look. In other words, the greatest strength of that film was to insert people in that visual. It is impressive, that Blade Runner influenced several generations, but Blade Runner 2049, does not influence anything. Nothing in the visual department captures the spectator's imagination. Denis Villeneuve fails roundly in this department, everything in 2049 is copied and recycled from other people's works. Here there is no imagination, but purely a copy. Blade Runner influenced, 2049 did not influence anything or anyone. I'll just say one example. The director of the film created a young Sean Young, using visual effects. Ironically, this has already happened in Terminator Salvation with Arnold Schwarzenegger. Another unnecessary sequel to a futuristic film with strong sci-fi elements made in the 80's.That brings up the question, who had the sad idea of creating a sequel to Blade Runner if you can not create something visually interesting and if the movie itself was a box office flop in 1982. The answer is simple, it's about the money. Nowadays in Hollywood, the studios are desperate to create franchises, which can attract people as if they were drug addicts, to go to the movies regularly. Warner Bros. already tried in 2015 with Mad Max Road Fury, and now tries to do with Blade Runner in 2017. It's all about money. Instead of trying to create something new, Hollywood studios try to create franchises, based on pre-existing films, because it's so much faster, easier and there's no financial risk. This is because movie budgets are constantly growing. And of course Blade Runner in its releases for home entertainment, whether on VHS, DVD or Blu Ray, has always had solid sales. Blade Runner was a hit on TV as well. Like The Shawshank Redemption or Fight Club, films such as Blade Runner were a box office flops, but hits in other media. People kept talking about these movies, even after they were released in theaters. You can not catch a lightning bolt twice in a row. This is because 2049 brings nothing new for people to talk about. It's a passable, forgettable film just for making money.This is why, Denis Villeneuve not only fails to create an interesting visual experience. As a film, Blade Runner 2049 crashes in all other departments. Not only that, but Blade Runner never needed a sequel. The story to tell was all told in the first film. Blade Runner never needed a sequel to expand the story, just as movies like Chinatown, L.A Confidential, or Casablanca don't need a sequel. In a sense, this film is almost a remake of the first, done in an amateur way in the sense of modern blockbusters. The film begins with an unnecessary setup between the characters Ryan Gosling and Dave Bautista. From that moment on, Denis Villeneuve began to put the typical gestures and mannerisms of modern movie scripts. I say of course, there has to be the unnecessary revolution/revolt against the system (the similarity that existed with The Matrix), but, unlike the original, everything here is in excess.
That is one of the biggest mistakes in the script of this film, is to transform a male film with a strong focus on sci-fi (sci-fi is not a genre that the female audience is interested) with useless dramatic elements. You know the same mistake that Denis Villeneuve did last year with Arrival, he had the audacity to do with the sequel of Blade Runner. Let's be clear, if I want a strong dramatic film, I see Schindler's List. If I want to see a male sci- fi, I see Aliens, Terminator or Blade Runner. Do not try to mix the two things Denis Villeneuve. The movie loses its tone. Not to mention, the silly lines of dialogue (and what you expected from the guy - Michael Green - who wrote Green Lantern), stupid I know. Despite that, the original film leaves room for the imagination about that universe and its characters (e.g: Jared Leto's character killing a replicant, just to make a point, or whatever). Who was the villain at the end of the first film, Deckard for doing his job or Roy Batty who killed people, however he wanted to live. In Blade Runner 2049, there is nothing to think about, everything is black and white.
This new film leaves no room for imagination, everything here is explained, as if it were an equation - at the end of the second act a character reveals to the character ""Joe/K"" that he was not the chosen one (as in many other sci-fi films) and the end itself is only a generic twist and totally out of context (as in Arrival) with a character that appeared only one scene (but do not worry about, the obligatory third movie is already being planned) in the original Sean Young's character was quite a while before the end of the movie. In contrast the film has totally useless scenes that only serve to increase unnecessarily the extension of the film itself.I'm not going to write anything else, about this useless movie, that comment on the final battle between the characters of Ryan Gosling and Sylvia Hoeks. She also knows Kung-fu and says stupid one- liners (""I am the best"" among many, or whatever). Trash lines of dialogue, we have here. To talk about the character of Sylvia Hoeks that does not reach the feet of Roy Batty. While in the original, the scene of the rain had a sense, because the character of Rutger Hauer wanted to live, this is why the scene is soon iconic. In this new movie there is one fight scene, just to look ""badass"". Once again, Hollywood had feminized a great and good villain into a woman to appeal to the female audience (say hello to Ghostbusters 2016). Not only that, the film treats women as sexual objects (the stupid hologram of the woman with pink hair), prostitutes or with violence. A film without its own identity, the film is not meat or fish. Incidentally, not even filmmakers know what they want.
Pathetic."
213," Fake Reviews are propping this disaster up
","This movie was just awful in so many ways. I had a very hard time staying awake and an even harder time making sense out the extremely slow story line unfolding. I kept thinking the entire time I was watching it that they were just filling time with empty, meaningless scenes. In the end I was convinced that the entire story could have been told in about thirty minutes, with some decent action, and it would have been a lot better. The main way to describe this movie is that, to be kind, the story line took a backseat to meaningless but beautiful HD cinematography. The story was difficult to follow and had an all over the place and meaningless feeling to it. No one in the theater said a word when it was over. They all just got up and walked out looking bored out of their minds. Character development was next to non existent with the exception of a few scenes that pretended to develop the main character. Since I had to give it one star to rate it, I will say that star was for the actors, who in my opinion did as good a job as possible with the horrible, painstakingly slow script they were give. My last complaint is that I have been duped into going and seeing a few movies because the IMDb rating was initially very high, only to end up wasting my time and money. I am convinced that the good reviews are fake and most likely paid for. It is IMPOSSIBLE for people to be rating this garbage a 9 or 10. Perhaps someone who is deaf and just loves looking at HD scenery in movies would have loved it. Other than that it would take a seriously unique kind of person to think this movie was decent, much less good."
214," What was the story exactly?
","I was expecting something really awesome like Terminator meets Altered Carbon but no, not even close. A slow, boring film with no discernible story line. Some nice visuals yes but 3 hours Zzzzzz. The other 10 star reviewers must have been watching something else..."
215," Every scene: Important; Extravagant; Pure Perfection
","A classic in the science-fiction genre, ""Blade Runner 2049"" is a slow, mastered piece of film, directed by Denis Villeneuve (debuted in the sci-fi genre with the masterpiece, ""Arrival""). This film is a true masterpiece of cinema and , greater than the original, but not a masterpiece such as 2001 (which attacks concepts and beliefs), whereas ""Blade Runner 2049"" succeeds not only driving the plot, but speeds down the highway, amazing onlookers. Although the film may seem slow based on the trailer, it allows for character development on a whole new scale with twists and turns which will shock you beyond belief! Ryan Gosling (""La La Land"", ""Drive"") stars as K, the new blade runner, replacing Harrison Ford's role as the original blade runner. Ryan Gosling provides a spectacular performance, draws upon all of his acting skills in order to deliver this blank, emotionless protagonist which is necessary for this role. But to oppose K is a violent emotionless replicant, although, personally, this latest addition is not as lovable as Rutger Hauer, but makes a fantastic villain for battle.The film, although visually slow-paced, is mentally thrilling, with an absolutely brilliant soundtrack, composed by Hans Zimmer (Dunkirk; Interstellar; etc) juxtaposed with some of the most beautiful cinematography of this year. Easily one of the greatest films of the year, ""Blade Runner 2049"" is not only a fantastic film, but one of the greatest sequels ever produced."
216," The master of all but one
","I think the movie was very seamless, it showed us believably a world where fear dominated each decade with different incarnations. The apolitical fear of surveillance is put in front, where nefarious people can track K down wherever he went. That is something beautiful, and inevitable for such tech. The blade runner himself seemed to be believable, but I think the forced resistance towards the end made it dangerous close to becoming trapped in the Divergent generic pop. Ford's signature attention to detail could have been used in more than one scene with the blind man, but I enjoyed the fact that he was put into the movie in a very organic way. I also thought the ending was dragged out a bit too much, and I was very miffed that Jo's girlfriend died, so minus one star from me. But then again its movies that make us feel all kinds of emotions, so one star is added for its realism and lack of tact. Thank you."
217," Don't listen to the bad reviews, fantastic Sci-fi sequel to the original!
","The only reason I can believe someone would not enjoy this film is because they were expecting an action pack action film with a shallow plot, Blade runner isn't that and never has been! It follows on from the original brilliantly, sound track and atmosphere have been nailed! If your a fan of sci-fi and loved the original you will not be disappointed."
218," Blade Stumbler
","Three points out of ten only for the cinematography, which equals expectations -- and is the only thing about this sequel that does. Maybe if it wasn't so over-hyped I would have been more tolerant of its weaknesses, which follow: there is an hour's worth of fat worthy of Terence Malick at his worst, meaning exposition for its own sake that never carries the story forward but serves as a backdrop for childish indulgence in visuals, that could easily have been cut; while the plot is tortuously convoluted and needed to be far more linear. The cast obviously reveres the material and is intimidated by the source, making for distance in their acting. James Edward Olmos, so sinister and subtly threatening in the original, has an unnecessary cameo as a doddering version of his younger self. And where is Vangelis, whose music added another dimension to the original? The music in this one is mediocre at best. I wonder if Ridley Scott was needed at the helm. Maybe my perspective is colored because I was there the first week the original Blade Runner came out and loved that great film, but if anybody who was there with me in the early 80's feels differently I'd love to know."
219," Great if you need to fall asleep
","Boring and slow and at times really stupid given how it is supposed to be a dystopia, but there are pretty slender girlfriends, instant food, cute hookers and tech to enjoy. This at least made me laugh My advice if you have to go is take a blanket and pillow fast forward to the girlfriend and threesome scenes and then get a good shut-eye."
220," Great film
","That helped me catch up on some much needed sleep.Otherwise, what is the point of this film? That the villain is still alive, at large and in control? The old Blade Runner lives and the new one dies? The world is post apocalyptic, but beautiful flakes of snow fall on the ground? The girls are sexy, the hookers are available and one can buy holographic girlfriends in short skirts that make men's mouths water? Is that a grim future?? In other words, this film doesn't make sense. It is not as boring as stupid flicks like the new Star Wars or whatever, but despite the praised effects this film was nonsense and definitely too long. Thank goodness for beautiful women eye candy."
221," Sigh
","I know it's a Blade Runner movie, but these ratings here are unreal. The film has no real storyline and is like an assortment of illogical scenes, including the last 15 minutes that resolves nothing and sets itself up for a sequel.The worst movie I've seen this year, if it wasn't for the slim women."
222," A modern cinematic masterpiece that tops the original.
","Blade Runner 2049 is the highly-anticipated sequel to Ridley Scott's 1982 masterpiece Blade Runner. Harrison ford returns as Rick Deckard and Ryan Gosling plays a younger Blade Runner. That is all I will say about the plot, for director Denis Villeneuve wanted viewers to walk into it knowing virtually nothing. This is a great decision that more films released today need to consider.To put it simply, Blade Runner 2049 is a cinematic masterpiece. It does everything I wanted it to do and more. It is, along with Dunkirk, tied for the best film of 2017 so far in my opinion. Going in I thought the runtime would be a bit long given it was nearly three hours long. Boy, was I wrong. This film flies by so fast, that when it was done I felt like I could have watched it for hours more. The cinematography is so amazing, that some scenes literally took my breath away. The Blade Runner universe is even more well-realized in this film than it was in the first film, which is saying a lot. Watch this in the biggest and loudest theater that you can possibly find, because the imagery combined with the score makes for an experience like no other. Astonishingly, the visuals aren't even half of the reason why Blade Runner 2049 is such a masterpiece. This film took me places emotionally that I never dreamed of it possibly going. It asks you what it means to be human, and again shows the thin line between replicant and human. Because you are so invested in the story, the movie is that much more suspenseful, keeping you on the edge of your seat for the entire two hours plus runtime. The people who are calling Blade Runner 2049 ""slow"" obviously can't handle a film that doesn't contain some kind of explosion in every other scene, because this film is the opposite of boring. I was riveted for the entire film, despite it being more of a sci-fi drama than an action blockbuster. This film also pulls amazing performances from its wide array of talented actors. Ryan Gosling has been hitting home run after home run lately, especially with La La Land having come out just last year. He gives another great performance here, and I can't wait to see him as Neil Armstrong in the Damien Chazelle-directed biopic. Harrison Ford proves yet again that he hasn't lost his touch at all despite his old age. Another good find is Ana de Armas, who kills it with a surprisingly complex performance. I wish I could say details about their characters, but I really don't want to spoil the film.Honestly, I loved nearly everything about Blade Runner 2049. There were countless scenes where I felt chills because of how riveting and emotionally compelling the film got. Blade Runner 2049 is most definitely going to be a classic in this period of cinematic history, and I genuinely believe that this film simply could not have been any better.I give Blade Runner 2049 an A+."
223," Every scene a winner!
","It's a masterpiece, an updated treatment over the original Blade Runner of human kind's future relationship with AI. Some people criticize the pacing for being slow. Although some scenes do play out slowly, halfway through the film I recognized the pattern that *every* scene has a major payoff--no wasted time. A more artful film would have included more character development. But this movie wants to intrigue at every turn and-- especially if you're a fan of the original--it does so in spades. The hooks to the original Blade Runner are great, yet this movie would stand on its own. The story and acting are great--even Gosling's ;-) The female characters are great. The sets and effects are great. I take off one star for the soundtrack: too boomy, not enough quiet moments listening to rainfall and street chatter, the flying cars (""spinners"") are noisy, and the music isn't musical enough. For people coming to the Blade Runner movies for the first time, many current generations have no idea what a nuclear winter is either--all we've heard about for a couple decades now is global warming."
224," Boring Movie
","It is not even worth watching. Spend your 2 hours and 45 minutes watching paint dry or water freezing into ice. Or watch Disney on ice, that one is even better than this. Me and 2 mates went for this movie after work , thankfully the meal and beer before the movie , saved the evening for us. Will not watch this ever again."
225," A Sci Fi favorites return that improves upon it's predecessor loved it!
",Somehow I never saw the original Blade runner but was fortunate enough to catch a double feature last night enjoy the original and see 2049 right after without waiting decades for the follow up. 2049 is true to it's predecessor and expands upon it masterfully. Tie ins to the original are not forced but ever-present and enjoyable. The second and third acts are filled with suspense and more action than the first. The film opens with action then begins to lay groundwork for the rising suspense and climax to come. While there are a good amount of cameos no performance is wasted or unnecessary. I should point out that this is not a Harrison Ford movie alone it is a Blade runner movie. An excellent one at that and while he is not the star his moments on screen are perfectly timed in his return to the iconic role as Deckard. A long run time was not discouraging but rather necessary to reveal the complex Sci Fi world that is Blade Runner.
226," Breathtaking visuals & semi-boring characters
","My first IMDb review (English is not my mother tongue).The BR2049 movie looks great sometimes but large parts of the film are shot on a gray foggy background which is way less visually interesting as the neon colors that come back a few times during the film. The opening shots are an almost shot-for-shot remake of the original which was fine by me. Los Angeles while expanded on compared to the previous movie, seemed less ""alive"" as in the original Blade Runner (remember that bicycles shot that last 35 seconds in BR 1982, that's how you set the mood of your city). Still, some places like the ""House"" of Jared Leto simply looked fantastic.Characters: Dave Bautista ""character"" while advertised as a main part of the plot is just there for the beginning of the film and I think it is a shame. He could have been a nice antagonist (the brutal warrior) to Gosling.The holographic woman was an intriguing character that leaves us with many questions ""Was she really in love with Ryan?"", or ""was she just programmed to be in love?"", ""Is she capable of real emotions?"".Ryan gosling is extremely low-key in this film, no funny lines, almost no dialogue, he doesn't seem to feel any pain at all when stabbed or shot at, which basically removes a lot of potential tension. Because he is so alien to us, it hard to follow him on his journey or to care about what he is going to discover.Jared Leto was the worst. He looks fine but does a lot of monologues that are not that smart or interesting. Plus as a character, he is not very threatening because he does not leave his factory once in the film.Harrison Ford had almost nothing to work with, he is found by Gosling after 2 hours and 15 minutes of film, they have a small fight, then Ford is captured and Gosling must save him. That's about it.Robin Wright had almost nothing to work with, except interacting with Gosling who's a robot following her orders. I don't remember her leaving the LAPD office once in the film. She was not threatening or smarter than anyone else.Sylvia Hoeks character, working for Leto, did a little bit more than Robin. Still, I believe she was a weak antagonist because she had no goal for herself, she was just the ""I-work-for-my-boss-and-do-what-he-wants-me-to-do"" kind of bad girl. She had no deeper connection / rivalry with Gosling or Ford.The main problem of the film is that it expands on parts of the original that were already not that great to begin with: The love story between Rachel and Deckard was always ambiguous and sometimes not romantic at all (like the ""sex scene"" which resembles more a rape than anything else). Bringing this element back and playing it like it was a ""true love"" relationship instead of a semi-abusive one does not work in BR2049.BR2049 uses too many ""zoom and enhance"" scenes that were already boring and confusing in the original Blade Runner. This time, it happens more often and it slows the already slow-paced movie down.Rachel is brought back for one scene of 30 seconds, the CG in my opinion looked great but it was again, a pointless call back to the original done tastelessly.They go so far as to play dialogues from the original, this time it has a purpose plot wise but again, distracting and maybe a bit forced.The film itself, like its predecessor, is extremely slow-paced, even the actions scenes are shot and played kind of realistically, no big explosions or big shoot-out. Villeneuve did that already in ""Sicario"" and it worked back then because the character were easier to relate to or intriguing and stakes were high. In this one, I would have appreciated a little bit more action scenes to be honest. Moreover, in ""Sicario"" or ""Prisoners"", the people in danger are humans, which means, a simple bullet or a simple stabbing can kill them, whereas, in BR2049, Ryan is a Replicant that appears to be immune to pain. Therefore a non-impressive (or non-over-the-top) action-scene might not work as well as it did in the previous movies because the sense of threat and danger regarding the life of our protagonist is not remotely there.The music, similar to the Vangelis theme but left me a bit cold, the original theme makes a nice comeback at the end of this movie whereas, during the rest of the film, just bits of it are played and the parts are, have been reworked to sound more electronic which is a detriment to the movie.I had high hopes and fears about BR2049. Hopes because the guys working on it (Villeneuve & Deakins) always deliver the most beautiful movies you can imagine. Anxieties because Blade Runner does not need a sequel, no matter who's doing it. Its story is self-contained, leaves a lot to interpretation and its open ending is just the perfect way to end the story of this ambiguous film. After watching this film, I was both right to have hopes and right to be anxious. The film is a mixed bag of breathtaking visuals and boring characters, lofty dialogue and average scenario. You should not make a movie that asks ""what does it mean to have a soul?"", ""what does it mean to be human?"", ""Can machines have emotions?"" if every one of your character acts and feels robotic, or at least feels flat and not that interesting."
227," Visually amazing, but very slow!
","*Spoiler* Good sequel. The costumes, cars, buildings and architecture are well thought and the movie is like a series of amazing photos one after another. Good acting. Harrison Ford appears near the end of the movie. I don't give it a ten because the movie is too slow, very slow. I get the effect the directors wants too achieve but even the flying cars and fighting scenes are slow! very slow. Very very slow."
228," The Rare Sequel That Lives Up to the Original
","It's not easy to capture lightning in a bottle. Perfectly recapturing the look, sound, feel, and unique blend of elements that defined the original Blade Runner is no small task. Capturing its substance is harder still. And yet this film does it perfectly. Director Denis Villeneuve and the others involved have succeeded in creating the rare sequel that perfectly recreates the style of its predecessor while expanding on its story and themes.Ryan Gosling stars as Officer K, a new model replicant who works for the LAPD ""retiring"" unstable older models. He lives alone, except for his house's holographic interface, who gives new meaning to the phrase ""virtual girlfriend."" Like all of the new models he's very good at his job and never questions orders. At least until a ""routine retirement"" turns up a secret that challenges everything he thought he knew about his nature, and could change the global balance of power- or plunge what's left of civilization into war.The original Blade Runner asked intriguing questions about what it means to be human. 2049 goes a step further, questioning the nature of what's real. Characters struggle with whether their memories are their own, someone else's, or something entirely manufactured. The mutual affection between K and his holographic girlfriend raises the question of whether an AI can truly feel, or if there's any way for her to become a real girl. And the enduring question from the ending original Blade Runner is still very much open.Visually this film is a masterpiece of bleakness. LA is still the shadowy, run down megatropolis it was before, just a little flashier and newer. Endless sheets of rain still pour down on darkened streets as streetlights and flashing signs struggle to illuminate the perpetual gloom and holographic ads offer pleasures of every kind to passersby.Only this time the streets don't seem so crowded as before. Which makes sense given that anyone who can afford to has bought passage off planet. Because if LA is dystopian the world beyond its walls is downright post-apocalyptic. San Diego is a wasteland out of Mad Max; a vast scrapyard dotted with the ruins of old high rises and occupied only by desperate bands of scavengers and outlaws. Vegas is as quiet as a tomb; shrouded in a haze of cloud and dust, its casinos sitting as though frozen in time. And in between is only desolate emptiness as far as the eye can see. And it's all so artfully photographed and exquisitely atmospheric.Harrison Ford doesn't have as much screen time as the trailers might have suggested, but whenever he's on screen it's clear that he hasn't lost a beat. The weariness and slight grumpiness that seems to be his default setting these days serves him well as the reclusive old Deckard, gone semi-paranoid after so many years in hiding. He throws a mean punch for a man his age, and radiates a mix of anger, sadness, and tired resignation as he describes all that's transpired in the last thirty years. Gosling likewise excels in the frequent action scenes and gives a wonderfully nuanced performance as a man questioning who and what he really is.But Jared Leto might make the strongest impression. As ruthless industrialist Niander Wallace- creator of the new generation of replicants- he is a study in contradictions. His manner is eerily emotionless, yet his gaze exudes brilliance and obsession. He calls the replicants his children and speaks of their destiny and need to grow, but treats them as disposable. And his zeal to propel mankind forward makes him merciless to anyone who stands in his way. We're not entirely sure what he is either. He seems to be a cyborg, but it's unclear how far the changes go, or if he might be something more artificial altogether. What I do know is that this performance is enough to redeem him for his overwrought turn as the Joker in Suicide Squad.If this movie has a fault it's that it stays too faithful to the original's grating synthesizer soundtrack, heavy on reverb and distortion. But then again, I suppose that it does fit the film's mood and add to the sense of tension when needed. And while the fights and shootouts are very good, nothing can match Deckard's battle with Roy in the last film. Blade Runner 2049 is not quite the original, but it comes very close. And for a movie like Blade Runner that's high praise indeed."
229," Sequels do not get better.
",An absolute triumph of a sequel. I've just finished watching it for the 4th time and it simply just gets better and better. What a show. I am forever indebted to Denis Velneuve. Watch the original final cut. Then watch this. Cinema does not get better.
230," A sequel we deserve.
","Feeling a deep sense of awe in almost every frame of blade runner 2049. I would like to think, that this is how audiences felt back in 1982 looking at these spectacular visuals for the first time (I seen the original blade runner in the cinema a couple of years back and I felt it even then).The sequel blade runner deserves it continues with the massive themes, about our existence and such. While taking it on a new path, influences are in there from different sources but this feels like it's own film. It also feels unique despite numerous attempts at sci-fi world building this decade alone.¬† It takes its time and thank god for that. You really get a sense this was the film, the creators were wanting. A bold blockbuster in an age where fast paced/quick cut edits are all you see in big budget blockbusters.¬† Blade runner 2049 was a delight."
231," Back to the blade
","The original Blade Runner was a futuristic noir thriller. It did not need a sequel but maybe like another film released in 1982, Tron, the producers thought a belated sequel was required.Denis Villeneuve directs with Ridley Scott taking a hands off Executive Producer role. The visuals are still great but not as breathtaking as the original film. We see a dark multi ethnic rain soaked LA with giant billboards.Ryan Gosling plays Agent K, a replicant whose job is to retire the older replicants produced in the era of the original film. The newer replicants are OK still being used as slave workers.Agent K comes across some buried bones which again leads to an investigation into identity, false memories and the whereabouts of an impossible child, now grown up.Jared Leto plays the mad messianic Wallace, the man who has taken over the Tyrell corporation and produces replicants but wants to creates life. He thinks Agent K will find the answers and sends one of his replicants out to assist and hinder his mission.Harrison Ford returns as Deckard who hangs around in a desolate Las Vegas hotel with holographic images of Elvis and Frank Sinatra who might hold the clues to what happened to the child.Blade Runner 2049 is really an overlong art film, it actually lacks the thriller element of the original film even some of the weird humour. I rewatched the original Blade Runner before I saw the sequel, despite the po-faced narration his Deckard provides some humour.Blade Runner 2049 has a few cameos from the original film including an iconic recreation of a replicant which excellent use of CGI.However the pacing and length is a negative, the story is not strong enough to sustain it although I have to credit the writers to lead you up one way and them wrong foot the viewer."
232," Full Immersion, No Prequel Needed
","Let me preface this by saying I did not like the original Blade Runner from 1982 nor am I a fan of Philip K Dick so naturally I did not read Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep. Which also means this movie rated high on my list. If you did like the original your opinion will not line up with mine.I am in love with this world that has been re imagined in Blade Runner 2049. The opening scene alone with solar farms, flying cars and growing maggots for protein. The future doesn't seem that far away. It looks plausible.Yes, the movie does run a bit long. The pace is slow enough that you can enjoy seeing the sights. And yes, there are some scenes--especially the last part with Harrison Ford and snowflake--that are utterly unnecessary but the entire film is beautiful.The interplay with memories was excellent. Ryan Gosling fit his role very well. For a first time watch most of the plot twists are surprising but could be made stronger with the removal of a few scenes. Settings are wonderful. The grating 80's feel of the original is made subtle. The technology is my favorite part. I want to be a memory maker in the future!"
233," Worst movie in ages
","I'm not sure, if the creators of this 2,5 hours long movie made it so boring on purpose, but is just terrible.The main character should have been played by Arnold Schwarzenegger, because he is like a terminator or he can join Justice league. He can be shot, hit multiple times with the knife and still swim like a dolphin and to kill people with face like he doesn't care. Actually, it looks like nobody bothers to make a any kind of dynamic in the movie after they made a decent trailer. All characters looks doomed, like the have absolutely no idea what to do. The whole movie is long long journey to moment at the end when main characters just stand beside the stairs for 5 minutes in silence, with terrible music at the background. I hope CGI artists got paid well, because the visuals was only good thing about this movie, and it's not because of nudity.I watched it in the movie theater and half of viewers were gone after first hour. The movie does not worth watching at all.Did anybody checked the movie before showing it in movie theaters? Does Warner Bros. have good editors and movie directors? I guess, not any more. They just want to pay for ratings and do trailers to get you spent money and time for raw product."
234," Unconvincing and boring
",I had high expectations for this sequel. The music was often inappropriate and annoying. It did not seem like 2049 at all. Many parts of the movie seems to unnecessarily drag on. I struggled to sit through to the very end. One of the most disappointing parts of the movie was that they were still smoking!
235," I wish I had watched paint dry instead
","The hardest thing about the movie was trying to stay awake. It was 90 minutes too long. The acting was so boring, at one point I thought most of the characters were robots, and I had to remind myself that they are clones(Replicants). Do yourself a favor and watch something else, anything really..."
236," Best film of 2017 so far
","Blade Runner 2049 was my most anticipated release this year so I went in with high hopes. The original is a great sci-fi and a visual wonder, it wasn't without flaws so I felt there was plenty room to improve over it. The sequel is better for the most part. It was an intense disturbing film full of ideas and interesting visuals that bring the dystopian world to life even better than the original. The story is very simple but fleshed out so that the viewer can be invested in every scene. You may be able to see what's coming but the way it unfolds is satisfying. Below the surface you can also see the themes of how toxic the abusive capitalist culture around women, advertising and just about everything we consume is. Its a sad depiction of what could be the future. The main themes of the film stay consistent resulting in an emotional ending that left me very satisfied. My only critique is the villain felt a little underdeveloped which is OK for me because I really don't like Jared Leto anyway (but that's just me). There were also a few moments that had me wondering why certain bad decisions were made by the villains but its all forgivable.I wasn't aware that J√≥hann J√≥hannsson had dropped out from scoring the film until after I saw it but Hans Zimmer's soundtrack was absolutely phenomenal. The score complements every scene perfectly and conveys the feelings of the main character really well. I'm just a little disappointed thinking of what could have been if J√≥hann J√≥hannsson had made the score. The visuals are breathtaking with some of the best CGI I've ever seen. I heard models were used for some shots and I honestly don't know what was practical and what was CGI so well done to the effects team. Oscar worthy direction, cinematography and effects for sure. The acting was simply incredible all around, from small parts like Dave Bautista's character to the lead, Ryan Gosling. Everyone gave an astounding amount of depth and commitment to their characters. There's also a interesting if not toxic relationship between Gosling and an AI played by Ana de Armas that could have been terrible but it is truly an interesting look into his character and it's played out well. Armas also does a great job playing the AI, making us wonder what she truly is. Part of me thinks Jared Leto was just being Jared Leto, but again that's just me being bias. His villain is highly disturbing but there isn't much reason behind it, (going back to my critique) so he's actually the least interesting character. But again, the journey of our main character is more important in a film that is already 163 min. His transformation is amazing and will not disappoint.Blade Runner 2049 is not perfect but it sure came close. I find it better than the first and a highly involving film that left me with plenty to talk about with people who had also seen it. The slow pacing might not be for everyone so I'll say that if you liked the first one then I'd recommend it. If you're new to it and interested then I'd highly recommend watching the original first as well. 2049 goes next to sequels like Aliens and T2, a rare gem we only get every few years or even decades."
237," A surprisingly sensitive sequel.
","Very early on, the film reveals something that sets it apart from the original. But without giving anything away here, it finds a way to maintain its own suspense and mystery. This is the film's strongest aspect; a film about identity that firmly establishes one of its own. This is no pale imitation of Blade Runner. 3D is effectively used to add another dimension to the cityscapes and high rise vistas that otherwise look authentically Blade Runner. It's worth seeing in the cinema as the 3D feels integral, not a gimmicky add on. A solid 9 and a film best seen before reading too many detailed reviews... so I'll end this one here."
238," A Pedestrian Labyrinth
","There's no disputing 'Blade Runner 2049' looks good - the vast decaying LA megalopolis, its futuristic interiors and surrounding desert wasteland are all portrayed with beautiful cinematography - but unfortunately the narrative arc doesn't match up to the scenery.This sequel starts off in familiar territory - just like detective Rick Deckard in the original movie, a replicant police officer called 'K' is tasked with terminating unreliable earlier models. In the film's opening sequence he's hunting down a target, and during the operation K comes across evidence of the birth of a replicant child. He's soon reassigned to find this offspring, and K's new mission obliges him to do a lot of zigzagging around the dystopian landscape in his flying police cruiser. He asks awkward questions of important people, and delves into the archives of secretive institutions. Occasionally K stops by his cramped apartment where he carries on an unsatisfying love affair with his hologram girlfriend. The detective work seems unnecessarily opaque and long-winded, even though it's punctuated by some sporadic violence, and clues eventually lead to an overwrought cliffhanger climax. The lasting impression - despite the film's visual impact, blockbuster budget and continuing references to the Theseus myth - is that it's all a bit underwhelming."
239," Boooooooring
","Great for insomniacs
If you want to be bored to tears or have trouble sleeping, please watch this slow paced, unthrilling sequel.
At least the woman is feminine."
240," Wait a minute, replicants can do... WHAT?
","In science fiction the viewer must believe in a certain fantasy in order to enjoy the story that will be presented. In Back to the Future you must accept the fantasy that it is possible to travel through time. In E.T. you must accept the fact that aliens from other planets do exist.In Blade Runner 2049 the main story is all about a certain ability the replicants seem to have - and it's a totally absurd and unbelievable one. That and a few plot holes almost wreck the whole movie.In the end Blade Runner 2049 is saved by the incredible visuals and the love director Denis Villeneuve has for the original. There are many big and small scenes that refer to characters and situations in Blade Runner 1. The film brings back two characters from the original (beside Deckard) and the second one is actually very well done. The now famous Vangelis soundtrack also plays a major part at the end. The first encounter between Gosling and Harrison Ford is an absolute delight, just like the performance of newcomer Sylvia Hoeks (who makes us Dutchies very proud). The film is long - almost three hours - and could have used a shorter cut. Blade Runner 2049 certainly does not surpass the original, but it's a courageous effort that's worth seeing in the cinema, especially in 3D IMAX. Only time will tell if it will also become a classic.7,5 / 10"
241," Ponderous, bloated, long, boring....and completely empty.
","I want to start out by saying that the original ""Blade Runner"" is one of my all-time favorite movies. I went into ""Blade Runner 2049"" with genuine anticipation, excitement, and a 100% positive attitude. I really wanted to like it....Simply put, this film was nothing but superficial, meaningless, monotonous eye candy. I was getting horribly bored 45 minutes into it, and yet it just went on and on and on for more than two additional hours.. It was as if the production crew worked so hard to capture the visuals, sound, and tone of the original...and to bring in Harrison Ford and Edward James Olmos...they forgot (or lacked the budget)to concoct a story.This was one of the most painfully boring movies I have ever sat through....and certainly the biggest disappointment.I will admit the visuals were well done....but the ""booom...BOOOM""...soundtrack....engaging in the first ""Blade Runner""....was just annoying here. In fact, the interesting visuals were the only reason I did not give this film a ""1""...it definitely deserves it.I was panicking midway through the movie...I was by then agonizingly bored...and I could not envision how....when...it would ever end. It really, truly, is that bad.""Blade Runner 2049"" currently has the inflated shill IMDb reviews that most big-budget releases start out with....but take my word. Once more people see this film, the truth will come out and I would wager it will be gone from the theaters in less than two weeks.Please...do yourself a huge favor....skip it!***I wanted to add after submitting this review***I find it amusing the people giving this movie positive reviews, who are more or less insulting the opinions of those who did not like it. I don't mean the shills who gave the film a positive review because they are biased or have a financial interest....I'm talking about those who think liking this movie makes them ""deeper"" and smarter...they get the deep mystery and meaning of the movie and those who disliked it do not.This is ridiculous and reeks of elitism...there is nothing ""deep"" in Blade Runner 2049. The movie is just too long and boring to support an almost non-existent story, it's that simple."
242," Poor sequel. Over hyped, long, slow & boring
","What a letdown & massive creative failure.Good: 1: Sylvia Hoeks as LUV. Good looking, cold hearted, ruthless ice maiden. 2: Dystopian atmosphere & set design. 3: Believable decayed future Earth setting. 4: Visual FX were seamless although not as pretty as Blade Runner (1982).Bad: 1: Editing was missing in action. Most of the film needed a lot more editing shots ran for ages which needed trimming. This created an overblown excessively long movie which was boring for long stretches of screen time.I feel asleep at least twice due to how boring it was. 2:Directing was very weak from the usually reliable Denis Villeneuve. 3:Story was very weak. Actors were given nothing to work with character wise. 4: Harrison Ford was utterly wasted. He has perhaps 10 min's screen time & about 30 lines of unmemorable dialog. Waste of the actor in an extended cameo for about 3 key scenes only.The movie just does not work properly either it needed at least 1 hour editing away to pick the pace up. As it stands now this is a very forgettable poorly conceived sequel which adds nothing to the original & even takes away a little goodwill due to how poorly this feels as you watch it unfold at a snail pace.I cannot believe how badly they dropped the ball either it looks perfect but just feels empty as the actors are given nothing to work with so it does not work at all & deserves to be a massive financial failure as it does not deserve any box office success.The power of the Hollywood hype machine cannot stop user reviews from telling the truth either!!!"
243," Overrated
",This is one of the most overrated movies of all time. None of it is really interesting at all
244," Exactly the sequel I have been waiting for...
","Though the original Blade Runner is over 30 years old, I only discovered the sci-fi masterpiece about 10 years ago, and I was instantly captured by it. The movie was a visual and audible spectacle despite its sharp and harsh tones and dreary dark settings. The plot was thick and rich, required real attention, and even a second look to really understand the depth of the story, largely due to jumps in chapter without the filler explanation material we normally receive. I loved the story so much, I bought and read the book, and then other Phillip K. Dick stories.Blade Runner 2049 is the sequel I have been hoping for since the end of the first story, this movie is unique as sequels go because it not only does justice to the original film, but to the book as well. The expansion on the story line is perfect, just unusual enough to fit the style of the original author, but not so much that it tries too hard. The plot is deep and follows the same style of the original, still offering plenty of surprises. The characters are true successors to the originals and the return of appropriately aged characters from the original film are on point and an integral part of the story line. There are a lot of negative comments about Ryan Gosling's performance, lacking emotion and style, but I believe that his character is exactly as dry and stoic as he is supposed to be in the dystopian future where he resides. The performance of all the actors and actresses was excellent and left nothing to be desired. This movie adequately answers many (but not all) questions that arose after the first, and effectively puts the story line to bed. There is not much of an opening for another sequel, so I genuinely hope that no one attempts it.To the naysayers of the film, the Blade Runner story is more than just a film, it travels much deeper into the writings of the original author, and to find films that truly project the style and vision of the author onto the screen is rare, but it happens here. I urge everyone to look at the film from a greater and more global view, with the book and two movies being equal parts of a whole experience. I for one, was thoroughly satisfied with the experience."

","Words are going to fall short to describe this movie.I went into the cinemas expecting a regular blockbuster.This movie surprised me. It is a CLASSIC. The pace of this movie is EPIC. You become a part of it immediately when you see it.The cast is impeccable. Cinematography, out of this world. Visually Spectacular. Audibly mesmerizing. Ryan Gosling pull of ""K"" effortlessly. Ana de Armas as ""Joi"" is beautiful. Robin Wright is fantastic. Harrison Ford is the Best as usual.I will say no more. Just go and enjoy the movie."
246," Beautiful, slow and boring
","Beautiful but excruciatingly slow and boring. I can't help but wonder what a faster-paced, same story, one hour less version of this movie would have looked like. Could have been a pretty good movie."
247," Crime-Noire Runs The Show: Not A Thrilling as I had Hoped
","There are plenty of movies in Hollywood, only some of which ever reach legendary status that seals their place in history. These sacred films were usually ended in a manner that didn't require a sequel, but leave it to the big studios to not leave things along. Tonight, Blade Runner 2049 premiers to the public, alongside some high review scores and plenty of praise. Despite the decades long gap, this movie holds promise to be just as good as the sequel. Robbie K is here to share some thoughts on the latest flick and help guide your viewing pleasures. LIKES:True Sci-Fi Crime: The trailers don't lie when they say Blade Runner 2049 is a crime noire film. It opens with the reference back to the first film and soon uncovers a mystery that will run the course of the movie. As this occurs, the other parties are seeking ways to hinder our ""hero"" (Ryan Gosling) from uncovering the truth. Like a glorified episode of half the crime-dramas on television, Blade Runner 2049 is all about capitalizing on a prolonged crime and mixing as much drama into it to help add character development. All of this is nicely wrapped up in a science- fiction spin, integrating the floating ships, robots, and large computers as the theater it unfolds in. Emotionally Artistic: The thing that many reviewers seem to appreciate is that the movie brings a lot of emotional punch to the audience. Our directors managed to interject a lot of feeling into Gosling's supposedly emotional character. As his story continues to unfold, you'll be submerged into the psychological nightmare he is forced to face. While the traumatic stress is certainly enough to pull some heart strings, it's the artistic portrayal of determining one's self that adds fuel to the fire. Self-Identity, a thing many struggle with, is well-addressed in this film, trying to uncover the truth about his self, all while solving the crime. Throw in a rather deep, albeit weird, romance story and you will round out the emotional plot lines many seek. Acting: A character is only as good as the actor who portrays it to life and Blade Runner 2049 is a shining example of quality acting. Gosling as the lead was a good choice, his ability to play a man with an identity crisis is quite believable, primarily in the way he seems to stand on the border of sane and psychopathic. While not his best role, I enjoyed seeing the anti-hero part played by him again. Harrison Ford reprises his edge well enough, but I felt they didn't utilize him as well as they could. Ana De Armas: I was happy to see more of Ana in this film, seeing her branch down some more emotional pathways, all while driving the character development of Gosling's character. Yet, I can't lie, that she was beautiful in the various outfits she shifted into during the film. I got the best of both world in this film, and appreciated the costumes that she sported in her awkward scenes. DISLIKES:Not so thrilling: The first Blade Runner had some suspense to it, the constant thrill of the chase as Ford tried to hunt down the rogue androids. It kept the pace going, all while integrating the elements I mentioned in the likes section. Blade Runner 2049 though wasn't that thrilling to me. The action was rather bland, the emotion with it almost as flat, and had little suspense outside of how much torture some of the characters could take. I expected a little more spice to the mix, but don't let the trailers fool you, the thrills were more like spills. Long: If a movie is going to be nearly three hours, it needs to either move, or have an exciting climax. I found neither of these elements in this movie, but instead a very drawn out movie that seemed to drag. While the message and artistic license are appreciated, the editors could have really dropped half the footage to get me out of the theater faster. Perhaps if the ending hadn't been predictable I would have been more intrigued, but I found myself fighting sleep at times because from these elaborate, and often unnecessary details. Predictable Story and Under Utilized Characters: Blade Runner 2049 might have been a well- built Sci-Fi Crime story, but that doesn't mean it wasn't predictable. Most of the ""twists"" I got in the first hour, leaving me nearly two to go until they revealed it. In addition, my expectations of where the story was going were also shattered as other characters were underutilized for more sappy looks and near depression. This especially goes for Ford and Leto, who I felt got the short-end of the stick in this film. Throw in some of the loose ends, more like bait for the next film, and it left me unsatisfied with where the story was going. Loud: Many films are loud in a theater with blaring music and special effects to make the seats shake. This movie though, just had obnoxious sound effects that were high-pitched groans, mixed with a soundtrack that while unique was not the most pleasing to me. Brace yourselves for this interesting sound soiree, because you are going to hear it a lot. The VERDICT:Blade Runner 2049 is artistic, a visual display that is packed with emotion, Sci-Fi charm, and a crime noire element. It has much of the same feel as its predecessor, but I felt it lacked the suspense and thrills that the trailers promised back in the teaser. Sadly the predictable story, underutilized characters and audio assault didn't justify the nearly three hour run time for me. Don't see this one when your energy is low folks, or you just might be fighting sleep. My Scores:Sci-Fi/Thriller: 8.0 Movie Overall: 6.5-7.0"
248," Early retirement for this one please
","Well, let's get the obvious thing to say out of the way and say, ""It's not as good as the original"" (whichever version of the original you want to take that to refer to). Not even close.So taking it on it's on terms, is it any good? It's alright is about as far as I can go. It's starts off reasonably promisingly, with Ryan Gosling retiring a replicant on a dusty farm. So we've already left the claustrophobic confines of the smoggy city already and you'd hope that would give the director lots of avenues to explore and unpick. And initially the idea of Rachel and Deckart having produced a successor, along with Joe's virtual affair offer some brief optimism. In a slightly gloomy way.Ryan Gosling plays a good emotionless cyborg. The problem begins when he's supposed to show that he's also developing emotions, and even potentially, a soul. That's tricky and requires range. Of which he has not a lot. The music crashes as it tries to wash around you but it's all a bit bombastic and overblown. The photography is serviceable but doesn't come close to Ridley Scott's world as in the Final Cut, despite the 10 years have passed since that version. The attempts at homage just feel like cheap and shoddy imitations.Then the story starts getting preposterous, as Joe finds two crucial characters by some form of laser guided internal radar system or something. Certainly, he manages to locate Deckart simply by finding a horse and then wandering into the desert, something which the evil Corporation hadn't managed in 30 years of trying apparently. We get a stupid diversion into an orphanage that is supposed to be Dickensian but simply serves as a giant PLOT DEVICE!!! Then an even more ludicrous fight scene in so much water I feared Kevin Costner was going to turn up. The finale was toe curlingly cringey.About half way through, someone at the end of our row started snoring. This went on for about 20 minutes. I don't know how he managed to sleep cos this is about noise and bangs and crashes in general, no subtlety whatsoever. Oh and lots of punching and stabbing or strangling woman mainly. Joe gets stabbed and doesn't flinch cos he's hard. And when the virtual love of his life gets killed, he doesn't flinch, despite this seemingly having been built up into a key strand of the story before. There's some half-arsed ""come the revolution"" interlude that looks like a Duran Duran video. I'm starting to rant now aren't I. Did I tell you that Bladerunner was my favourite movie ever. This isn't....wake up, time to die."
249," Sequel better than the original (short)
","Denis Villeneuve's new film Blade Runner 2049 is nothing short of ... just downright amazing. Everything about this movie is practically perfectly executed from the gripping and fluid performances to the color infused cinematography to the powerful soundtrack and sound design the film practically never skips a beat. The only flaw that wasn't really even a flaw in my opinion was that some scenes dragged for quite a while but I believe that the slow camera work was intended. The film has everything that made the philosophical original (final cut) a flawed masterpiece just it has everything the original was lacking.Gostling fit perfectly for the role of 'K', being emotionless but so full of emotion. Sylvia Hoeks was someone very worthy of a mention, giving an effectively eerie performance. Jared Leto as always is intensively remarkable and glued my eyes to the screen in each and every scene. Harrison gave one of the best and most emotional performances I have seen in his career.Now Hans Zimmer again blew me away completely. I got chills every 30 seconds when the cinematography and the score perfectly intertwined into an extraordinary absorbing symphony that makes the world of Blade Runner so real despite how unimaginable it actually is.10/10"
250," Fascinating a the beginning, slow and boring as it continues
","So you are a scifi lover. Then blade Runner comes out, so many critics, reviews such an amazing score on IMDb (8.6), fantastic trailer, great and promising cast. BUT? There is a big ""but"" in this whole movie. When the movie starts it is amazing, CGI's are great, fantastic atmosphere of the destructed world of the 2049 keeps you going and everything seems so interesting. There is one problem, even if though the story progresses, there are MANY points which are so slow and dull that destroy the whole movie. The movie should have moved forward faster in some points and have more action instead. Most action scenes are amazing but we needed more. At the end of the movie I had a sore butt because the movie was long and boring. Sorry but this is the truth."
251," Doesn't beat the original
","Great cinematography and cast. There's nothing more that they could do with the script that was given. I feel direction is what failed this film from being perfect. The pacing is slow and story a bit all over the place in my opinion. Sigh...and I loved the original - ah well. A decent film, but not a great film!"
252," Probably too cerebral for many viewers
","It's not the original movie, and I don't think its supposed to be. With that in mind, Villeneuve still does an excellent job of recreating the magic that captured so many sci-fi fans long ago in the original movie. A masterpiece of cinematography, visually stunning sets, intricate in detail, and vast. It's everything the original was but with a new twist, a slightly different flavor, new characters (and old), and with a soundtrack almost as haunting as Vangelis' original score. Even if you don't enjoy the film's plot you can't help but be astounded by it's beauty. So many of the scenes in this film are beyond words. I often wondered what was real and what was CGI and how in the Hell did they make it look so good. Eye candy! I'm sure there will be plenty of critics of this film (what piece of art doesn't have its critics?). And I suspect that like the original, this film will live on as a must see for true connoisseurs of dystopian noir sci-fi cinema. For me, the film works on so many levels. The casting was excellent, and I felt like everyone turned in solid performances. I can't recall a single scene in this movie that should have been cut. Some would complain that the movie is too long or moves to slow. Well, I submit that this is the same batch of folks that enjoy Micheal Bay films, fast food, facebook and texting. That's not meant to be an insult. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but I prefer a director to take his/her time in telling me a story and so I felt the pace was perfectly adequate. For me the story line was interesting, plausible and had depth in layers. Consequently, I think this is where the movie may loose some of its audience. Some folks are not content to watch a film and be challenged with questions. They prefer to be entertained on a less cerebral level. It might well be that Blade Runner and now Blade Runner 2049 ask too much of some viewers. Too many questions that are too hard to answer? Yes, just like the original, this movie is bleak, and it doesn't paint a very pretty picture of humanity or the road we may well be taking. Issues that have and still do plague humanity abound in this film. Slavery, race, ethical dilemmas, societal woes, the environment and unrestrained industrialization are all characters in this film. They play an important part in telling an age old story: love. Love of mankind, love of a child, love of a parent, romantic love, and even how we define love. Interestingly, one of the most compassionate, empathetic, and loving characters in the story is a program/hologram. Maybe what this film is really asking us to do is to spread a little more love. I can't speak for others, but I can say that I don't mind having some important questions thrown at me in a film. I like a gimps of a beautiful yet disturbing future where the human spirit can claw its way from the depraved depths of bondage and suffering and triumph over greed and arrogance. Where AI can teach us a lesson in humanity and where good can overcome evil with love."
253," Long, dark and boring with awful soundtrack.
","Went out of cinema after the movie and registered just to post a review.Being a fan of the original movie, I am deeply disappointed by the sequel. Last 3 hours (yes, this title is 3 hours long) was spent in vain.Mr. Denis Villeneuve, it takes more to create atmosphere than killing the lights and shooting most of the scenes in the dark.Mr. Hanz Zimmer, it takes more to create the soundtrack than just hitting some random synth notes here and there. You are not Vangelis, unfortunately.The plot is simple. All of the scenes are long and boring. This movie is far, far from the original."
254," A Shocking Disappointment
","Watched in IMAX. Paid just under ¬£50 for 2 tickets. Had to fight to stay awake. No story, no character development, no rhythm, no energy, no expressions on the charters' faces, no humour, no personality, no emotion, no impact, no surprises, no adventure, no reaction of any kind, no danger, no bad guy, no threat, no twist, no nothing, not a single stand-out memorable scene. Impossible to tell one character from the next. All the same blank-faced, nonspeaking, emotional retards scene after scene after scene. Everyone looking bored, tired and dozy like they've done too much sedatives. Pretentious, over-inflated themes that everyone is sick to death of. Ultra-predictable moments sold as huge reveals that we've seen 100 times in another 100 films going back 50 years. Incoherent, garbled dialogue mixed so badly you can't hear what they're saying. I couldn't understand 90% of what Jared Leto's said because he speaks in an inaudible whispering rasp with a stuttering tempo. Can't Villeneuve tell him to deliver his lines with more resonance and impact? What's wrong with them? What's the point of playing sound nobody can hear? Especially when you've paid ¬£50 and waited 35 years for it. Men of 12 stone crashing through solid marble walls? Panoramic, aerial vistas of LA in the smog with only Gosling's flying car in shot, no other cars, vehicles, people, movement or activity across the entire city? Phony, lazy, implausible effects. For a short time things looked promising, glowing reviews etc. But now it's evident that the Satanic hand of Hollywood has cursed everything good, everything noble. Star Wars, Alien, Tron, Ghostbusters and now poor old Blade Runner, that magnificent gem of classic sci-fi cinema. Denis Villeneuve lacks impact, bite, ideas, imagination, a pulse and any facial expressions whatsoever. Why does he keep getting hired? His films are just TV-movies, so plain and dull. This one's like a 3-hour long designer kitchen commercial. His involvement on this film was a giant misstep. They should have got someone like Gaspar Noe, Takashi Miike or even Ridley Scott to direct it, someone with a bit of edge.With Blade Runner 2049 Hollywood has once again looted our favourite classics and ruined them, reducing them to the realms of cheap, imagination-free, regurgitated, money- grabbing, formulaic horse-manure. I didn't want to have to ever type this but Blade Runner has now been cast atop that very manure heap, the foil of the origami unicorn just visible above the mountain of dung.Avoid this film, it's not worth your time or money and it will ruin your memories of the strange and brilliant 1982 original. Don't encourage the scammers behind this lazy, complacent piece of trash to make more films like this because these people are killing cinema. Keep your time and money for something more constructive and rewarding."
255," Visually impressive, but a difficult watch
","It was difficult to rate this film as it is visually very impressive and the story, though not particularly good, did keep my interest through the whole 2hrs 45mins. The low score is given for a total lack of character connection, me to them, or even them to each other. The first Bladerunner film has lots of interesting character relationships: Rachael & Deckard (love) Roy & Paris (friendship, mourning) Pris & JF Sebastian (friendship, pity, kindness) Leon & Roy (comrades, friendship, leadership) Tyrell & JF Sebastian (companionship) And of course the brief but evocative kinship between Deckard and Roy at the end of Roys life. This film is devoid of character relationships, most of the characters seem to exist as individual unconnected entities and that just does not work for a film. There is only one interesting relationship in Bladerunner 2049 - that between K and Joi, a genuinely interesting connection that makes their scenes together the best scenes in the film. Without character connections the film has no grasp on your emotions and is actually quite depressing to watch. The story though interesting, develops very slowly, I was expecting some big twist that never came. I can't blame the actors for this disappointing film as they have to try to act in a vacuum, apart from Jared Leto, who is just awful. I'd also have to say that the visual effects start to wear thin after a couple of hours, there's only so many dark shadows/ stripy shadows/ reflections of light from water/ more reflections of light on water / more reflections of light on water I can watch without it getting quite formulaic and repetitive. P.s. the film was criticised for not having strong female characters but this is not really true, I would say 3 of the 4 main characters are female."
256," I've... seen things you people wouldn't believe...
","...I've seen an amazing story removed of all subtlety and replaced with religious drivel wrapped up in a series of mindless, pointless action scenes with no explanation or point. Do you think that how in futuristic films there's often ecological ruin as a cautionary aspect, that the new Blade Runner is so bad to serve as a warning about the decline of cinematic values? If so then it's a masterpiece. If not, well...I am a huge fan of the original, usually mentioning it as one of my all time favourite films. I watched 2049 with some trepidation and yet was still massively disappointed and even a bit insulted. The plot was ridiculous and had religious tones, with the replicants referring to a 'miracle' and 'souls' over and over with what is honestly quite an impossible occurrence of one of them giving birth. I decided to just allow myself to believe this could happen but the film only got worse from there on. By the end I was so disinterested in what happened that I didn't even care about the death of K, arguably the only ambiguous part of the whole film. The original had masterful subtlety and ambiguity and left you seriously pondering the issues around AI. The original 'villains' had motives and depth, whereas in this the villains are mindless inhuman sadists with no substance whatsoever. This is a load of tarted up trash. You can slap a load of slick (yet uninventive) VFX on a bad story but it is still a bad story. Forgettable, insipid, insulting trash. I'd even recommend that there's more to be gotten from simply rewatching the original, especially since the new film brings no new ideas whatsoever. I wish I had."
257," VIEWS ON FILM review of Blade Runner 2049
","Blade Runner 2049 (my latest review) is the long-awaited sequel to 1982's cult hit, Blade Runner. Guess what, I'm gonna compare the two films outright. Like GEICO, it's what I do.""2049"" is forty-five minutes longer than Blade Runner, ""2049"" expands on Blade Runner's universe from three-plus decades ago, and ""2049"" is a little more violent and more action-packed. Still, Blade Runner 2049 is discombobulated. It's an inferior product that doesn't quite manifest as a rightful companion piece. There's less mystery, less darkness, no hypnotic Vangelis music, and less of a noir feel this time around. Sadly, those are the things I liked about the first outing.Now would I consider Blade Runner from 82' a masterpiece? Not quite. I'd still recommend it though. The storytelling is tighter than in ""2049"" despite both flicks being vehemently slow-paced. Blade Runner is a pioneer in the visual effects department and has a poignant, ironic ending. Blade Runner 2049 by comparison, is a nettlesome exercise that has too many ideas and tries too hard to be relevant. Sure its look is decent enough. But with a bloated running time, some scenes that should have been left on the cutting room floor, and some shaky editing, Blade Runner 2949 ends up being an annoying, sci-fi slog.People all over the world have been debating the humanoid status contained in the first Blade Runner. These fanboys have been doing it for the past thirty-five years. With ""2049"", they'll probably just sigh and wonder what all the new fuss is about.Harrison Ford reprises his Rick Deckard character for what feels like a minuscule cameo. Regrettably, he doesn't act with the mannerisms of Deckard enough to think that you believe he's back in Rick's nominal saddle again. It's almost a thankless performance. Then you have Ryan Gosling in the lead as protagonist K/Joe. Gosling is basically playing himself here. He's quiet, solemn, and appears like a less nastier version of his Driver trouper from 2011's Drive. Finally, there's Jared Leto as the ill-defined villain in Niander Wallace. It's Suicide Squad all over again because Leto barely registers in his role. It's like his presence feels akin to a separate motion picture altogether. That can't be good.All in all, Blade Runner 2049 unfortunately comes off like other sequels in the past. You'd rather watch the first film again the minute ""2049's"" closing credits come up. Rating: 1 and a half stars."
258," Should have stayed home
","OK, maybe it's my fault. I'm sure some sci-fi nerds will blame me, but I can't find a reason to like this movie. I left the theater feeling like I missed something, like there is some huge plot point that passed me by and my lack of intelligence is getting in the way of enjoying the movie. The cinematography, easily the best part of the movie, is self-indulgent as if the director told the editors, ""We paid a lot of money for these visually spectacular sets; put them on-screen until they are a complete distraction from the story line."" The music is so grating it rivals the sets in its level of obnoxiousness. At more than one point, I felt myself falling asleep, only to be jolted awake by the sounds of high school brass section competing to see who can play the lowest note.Add to those, the unexplained plot points and the movie is a recipe for walking out. Although I didn't leave, I haven't felt so compelled to do so since Leprechaun in 1993. If the rest of my party would have hinted they were done, I would have been out the door.In the end, I don't think the fault is mine. I think it's in the movie's producers who are trying to capitalize on the names, including Ryan Gosling, Harrison Ford, and Blade Runner, while making a movie that plays well to foreign box offices."
259," Beautiful and boring
",Beautiful to look at but a complete boring movie. Movie is too long should have been a 90 minute movie instead of over 2 hours. A lot of boring useless scenes. The acting performances are very good and the cinematography is just beautiful. The music score is good and uses some of the old cues from the first movie. I would wait for DVD rental.
260," One of my life's most awful experiences on the big screen!!!
","I just cannot begin describing how for an utterly awful, pointless and boring two hours and 43 minute long piece this is. A piece of nonsense and garbage! I wonder what the point was to have it in 3D when there wasn't even a remote need of it.I know there'll be people out there who'd say that I didn't understand the film. Well, alright, I really have no further time than the 163 minutes that I already gave this dustbin to understand it. For the first time in life that I felt so bored in the cinema that I would've literally shot the screen had I had a weapon! I think the reason behind such extreme frustration from me for this particular film is its really long length.Avoid at all costs! Don't go by the positive reviews and the money that it must be making."
261," If replicants aren't dangerous androids, then there's no reason for the movie.
","In the original movie Blade Runners were around to retire dangerous androids, called replicants, which were running amok. In the new movie, replicants are, for all practical purposes, GMOs, so there's no need for Blade Runners to even exist. Replicants are basically humans with serial numbers.They can put as many boobs in the movie as they want and it won't fill the terrific hole through the foundation."
262," Good Atmosphere, but not a good movie.
","Blade runner was not an enjoyable movie for me. People are praising the atmosphere. They are correct to do so, however there is more to a movie then atmosphere.The movie was really slow, even boring. I think it really comes down to three things. The atmosphere was dark and depressing, the plot was very slow to develop, the main character was unemotional. Any one of those things, or even two and it could still have worked, but with all three makes the movie slow and plodding. And that is besides the fact that the thing the bad guy was after just did not make sense, and they covered it up by making him not wholly rational even though he was a CEO of one of the largest companies on Earth.The original movie was good in large part because of the gray, because of the unknowns in it. Were Replicants machines or not? Was Decker a Replicant or not? Was what he was doing right or not? The new one has a more cookie cutter plot, there are bad guys and good guys and they make clear early on that the Replicants are human.www.JoshuaLawrencePike.com"
263," Impressive!
","This is one of the most impressive movie I 've seen in a long time. Like the old Blade Runner it's an art-house/cult movie and not a movie for the ""popcorn audience"". Visually perfect and the music is very dreamy and fits with the environment the movie is showing. Some say that the story is slow. It is if you compare it with the Marvel and DC movies. But I think it needs to be like this because there is a story that need to be told. Compared with the old Blade Runner movie, this one is on all fronts better. My advise is to watch it many times because it's a movie with many layers. A Masterpiece in my opinion!"
264," Beautiful emptiness
","Production-wise this movie is a masterpiece: scenography, light, some very impressive CGI, music, long and well done shots ‚Äì it will all make you feel like you're watching better, upgraded version of the original Blade Runner. However this artistic style, the fact that director took his time with every scene ‚Äì this will only make you feel worse when the ending credits finally appears. Then you will finally come to understand that this movie practically had no screenplay, story so weak that it only makes you wonder ""am I not getting something or what?"". What however is the worse is the main character ‚Äì another lonely robot with cybernetic soul. This movie is made for critics not for people who love movies. Why? Critics care little about story, or a purpose of the movie. For critic, screenplay is just one point on a long chart of requirements that ""good"" movie should meet. So the fact that spectator is totally detached from the main character makes no impact on technical side of the production. This is technically true. This is 2h 45min of nice views, great shots, some innovative CGI with no reason to watch it."
265," Sensational
","I can't write one of the eloquent reviews that I've seen regarding this movie, but I was thoroughly impressed.One of the best movies I've seen in years - possibly ever! Okay maybe I'm getting carried away but I couldn't find a flaw in it.Definitely one for the best cinema you can find. Great sound and visuals. Great acting performances and thoroughly entertaining. Beforehand I was a bit wary due to the film length but now I hope to go back and see it with my wife. Hell no, I WILL go back and see it again."
266," Arguably one of the worst movies of all time
","To be honest, was a great fan of the original BR, but then I had seen it as a teenager. Saw it again in order to remember it before watching BR2049 and found it ok, not so great. BR2049 is way worse. Slow moving, not much of a story, poorly done. Acting that reminds you of 70s cheesy action thrillers. Cliches that kept coming. There is nothing redeemable about the movie. I want my 2.5 hours back"
267," 15 min show stretched to 166
","God it's bad, I kept looking for the fast forward button. This show couldn't get worse unless you just took a bunch of stills and looked at each for 5 min. Even the ending is slowed to a crawl, or was it my skin that crawled. A very hard to understand storyline, but the fact that it stretched scenes so you had to watch, with painful background music, with no action or dialogue was awful!!"
268," Las Vegas is not what it used to be
","The ""hero"" of BR2049 is detective K, a replicant that chases other replicants. Why? It does seems a stupid idea, but apparently the new, Nexus 8 replicants are more ""obedient"" than their predecessors.K kills an escaped replicant, only to discover a big ""secret"" that the humans want to cover up at all costs. K is then chased by the human police and by the replicants' producer. He also starts to question his memories (as in Blade Runner) to discover a disquieting truth (as in BR, but in reverse...)Finally, K starts searching for Deckart, now living in Las Vegas with a cute dog. Deckart and K have a completely useless chase and fight scene that takes place - guess what? Just like in BR, in a huge, empty building. As a treat, we get an holographic show with Elvis, compounded by an holographic Sinatra, a couple of scenes later. That was the highlight of the movie.The plot is wrapped up by one of stupidest plot devices: the underground's fighters group, that manoeuvres K behind the scenes. Pathetic death scene, ripped off from BR, but with snow instead of rain and you are all set for another sequel. Not me, though.As an open question I'd like to know why I should root for the ""brave"" replicant underground resistance. They want to be more like humans, but humans are evil, so replicants want to get more evil... or something... whatever...I usually avoid ""sequels"" (AKA: commercial operations exploiting movies that were even only slightly successful), but Blade Runner is one of my favorite movies, so I caved. However, all stories must have an end and now I know that BR stands very much alone. I wish I could erase BR2049 from my memory, because of its offensive stupidity.It could have been just another bad Sci-Fi story, but the manipulation of nostalgic crowd probably proved more successful. I give half point to the dog and the other half to the holograms, which were cool."
269," YOLO- Don't waste it on this drivel!
","The soundtrack, a cacophony of earsplitting discordance that had me sitting with hands pressed to ears, is but one of the clues that this is a piece not worthy of consideration. Heavy reliance on background soundtrack is often an indicator of thin plot or weak screenplay - in this case the screenplay was pathetic, even garbled at times, and the film dragged tortuously along, almost in real-time, at least an hour and a half too long. I began rooting for the demise of the hero just to end my own misery, but remained in my seat hoping something interesting would happen. Visually monochromatically dark and ugly, if this is what passes for emotional depth and celebration of humanity, I fear for our culture. Theking has no clothes on!"
270," high hopes dashes
","boring, slow, long movie that feels long in a bad way, bad payoff, unless you're a og fan who wants nostalgia it may be fine. the theatre i was in most movie goes i asked did not enjoy it. Jared Letos character wasn't needed unless its for a sequel, his side kick was only needed at the end, honestly 30-45 minutes could have been cut and nothing would really changed film wise. Harrison ford stated and im paraphrasing, you can watch the movie as a sequel or stand alone, I don't agree with that. ending was a let down, Deckard finally sees his daughter hand on glass, end..... really wouldn't recommend to anyone but thats my opinion. If you enjoyed it, happy for you."
271," Not worth it
","Way too long, extremely boring and degrading to women. One day Hollywood will hopefully move on from the 'lets put naked women in the film for no reason other than to degrade them and sell a few extra tickets' thing. And Harrison Ford is hardly in the film at all although it does contain what is possibly the most awkward romantic scene ever. That's all ... this film is not worth many more words."
272," Sadly, it left no lasting impression on me
","Out of some masochistic, morbid curiosity, I was suckered into watching this on the big screen. Suckered by the 'rave' reviews, trailers and opinions of associates. For years, I mean years, I never, ever wanted a sequel. I never felt Blade Runner needed answers. If the movie seemed too ambiguous, than maybe, just maybe, that was its intention. Try reading the book. It's the same. What is Deckard? Phillip K. Dick never told us. The whole point to the story was to question what makes us human.2049's attempt in answering this question, to me, robbed itself of what made the first movie, so good.I did not walk into this movie expecting not to like it however. I put all my bias aside, and watched it with an open mind, a positive attitude, full of hope and wonder.For me, the movie seemed too clean, too digitised, almost sanitised of the rich, tangible atmosphere that made the first movie so real.I never really felt for K. Ryan Gosling was, well...Ryan Gosling. Its obviously just me, but his acting does nothing to make me care for this character. Harrison Ford's burnt out, old version of Deckard, also did nothing for me. Jared Leto was as hollow and pretentious as expected. Phillip K. Dick never followed up on his book, because everything you needed to know, and the point of the story, was right there inside.For all its details, 2049's execution left me uninspired, unmoved and care-free.Even the visuals never grabbed me. As stylised as they tried so hard to be, they did not detract from how I was left feeling, cold and empty.K's virtual girlfriend, to me, epitomised the whole film. Empty, detached and without heart or soul.I watched Blade Runner again on Blu-ray, just to make me feel better. I still get a lump in my throat at Roy Batty's dying words. And I still feel for Deckard and Rachel when they fall in love. Vangelis sounds as fresh today as ever. And the street scenes, in all their colourful, wet and grimy glory, sell to me, what the future is very much looking like being.None of those emotions crossed over into the sequel, for me anyway."
273," A movie longer than the ideas in it
","Denis Villeneuve has become an interesting director; INCENDIES was interesting, PRISONERS quite cynical, ENEMY and SICARIO real masterpieces. Not that fond of ARRIVAL but anyway it was acceptable. I am not a huge fan of Ridley Scott; I always believe that his visuals and concepts were larger and more interesting than the movies he crafted. Take for example PROMETHEUS and its follow up ALIEN CONVENANT. The first one was an interesting concept; completely destroyed in the follow up. Villeneuve was able to expand the BLADE RUNNER concept but instead of developing his ideas he dedicated more the visuals and expanded the movie to 2 hours and 44 minutes; which is at least one hour more than it needed to be. BLADE RUNNER was far from an action flick with a running time below two hours was able to deliver an idea; this one only delivers boredom. Lots of unnecessary over extended scenes that even great actors like Ryan Gosling have trouble to dealing with. And after almost three hours; the ending is simplistic and take away any interesting concept that could came earlier. Basically the final scenes leave the viewer expecting for more and obviously frustrated.In brief; if you are a hard fan of the original get good nap before entering the theater; you are going to fall sleep anyway but at least not so often."
274," Disappointing
","Blade Runner '82 was much better in EVERY respect, including visuals. Gosling's character was stoic, robotic and uninteresting. I don't think the movie is worth a lengthy comment but I have to write 5 lines.In conclusion, I suggest you save your money for a better movie. Blah blah blah..."
275," Just don't
","This is 2 hours and 45 minutes of your life you'll never get back. Both me and my friends were thrilled when the movie was over. Over-hyped and plain old boring movie. I would rather tell people to watch paint dry. Skip this movie, you won't miss anything. It might be a great movie if you're out of this world high on several drugs, but i really doubt that as well."
276," Moderate
","The original film had an authentic scenario, excellent music, fresh newconcept. This one missed the scenario, nothing new, and with a totalabsent of music, only an annoying industrial noise. Nice art for avideo art gallery but i don't recommended it if you want watch a quality fresh movie."
277," A waste of time
","Sorry, but I consider this movie a waste of time. Perhaps this says more about me than the movie, but what happens on the screen is not reachable for my logic to give the necessary meaning. As a sculptural statement from the world of movies is has its qualities, and the soundtrack in a theater with the right amount of amplifiers and loudspeakers is impressive, but for me that was also all"
278," Haunting and illuminating.
","A perfect eye and a pale near-void of complex, indecipherable patterns gives way to a sterile protein farm full of empty space; filled with a feeling of deprivation and loneliness. This is how Blade Runner 2049 begins before bringing us back to the wet, ultra-dense, black and neon maze of the super-city we know so well. This is how Denis Villeneuve lets us know right away that this is his movie, one full of reverence for the original, but a film that is much, much more than a mere homage.Villeneuve has always been much more Kubrickian than Ridley Scott ever was. In his best work, Scott was a great visionary and incredible composer, but he doesn't have quite the same feeling with the composition. Villeneuve continues to bring us transcendentally arresting visual arrangements, rather than copying Scott's style. This is an excellent choice because when you're picking up the thread of a work of art 35 years later, it's best to make your production your own.Once or twice I felt the dialogue might be a little on-the-nose to the themes, but I don't feel conclusive about this at all and I won't deduct from my grade. One thing is for sure, Villeneuve is not copying the original Blade Runner to any degree. There are a small handful of nods to the original, but this is such its own. The structure and pacing of this story is not at all a carbon copy of the first, and it does an excellent job of bringing you in sync with its rhythm.This is a challenging film, as it should be! There are many subtleties to the motivations of the characters. In particularly, there is a fight that moves from gunplay to fisticuffs that Gosling's character of ""K"" takes part in which I'm not entirely sure I understand the cause for, but I also don't see any clear break in logic to it, either. There are a great deal of elements to this work which are fine-tuned to evoke thought and contemplation. This is, again, in line with Kubrick's priorities and works.In some ways, this movie reminds me of Logan (2017). Naturally, Blade Runner 2049 was in production before that film was even released, so I would say it's more a matter of both of them tapping into some very classic themes; themes which seem to be very resonant at this moment.Nothing bad can be said about any of the dramatic talent. Everyone is the definition of pitch-perfect. The set work and special effects are all breathtaking. The music was for me almost 100% perfect and amazing, but the very loud and harsh ""waahhh-ohhh"" synth noises in ""Sea Wall"" (the music during the lead-up to the final confrontation) and reprised in the end credits music ""Blade Runner"" were not to my taste. They are anxiety-inducing with their timbre and tonality (probably intended) and also bring bad dubstep to mind, so this was an unfortunate negative piece for me. If they were a little different, it probably would have been much more welcome to me. As much as I dislike it, though, I can't imagine lowering the grade on an otherwise perfect film for a musical element that's only in the movie for not even a minute total split between two instances.Blade Runner 2049 possesses depth and integrality of meaning and emotion the equal of its predecessor, the original Blade Runner. It is a captivating and powerfully moving work of highest art, of the kind that is so very badly needed today. It is my most fervent wish that any further entry in this story maintains this level of excellence. To mar the existing works with a sequel that is anything less would be a crime."
279," Did I lose the plot?
","I'm not often lost for words, but I really don't know what to say about this belated sequel to Ridley Scott's 1982 BLADE RUNNER. The original was visually stunning and densely plotted. This new version is even more dazzling to look at, but if there's a plot to be found, I'm afraid I lost it. Ryan Gosling plays 'K', a new generation hunter of rogue androids for the LAPD. In other words he's the new Deckard (Harrison Ford) who was hunting rogue androids in 2019 Los Angeles (the 1982 movie was set in 2019). But he ends up tracking Deckard who has himself (I think) gone rogue. There are humans who may be androids and androids who may be humans, but this confusion was a major element in the first movie and there's a lot more of it now.At two and three-quarter hours the film is way too long. There's a protracted sequence towards the end in (I think) Las Vegas, in an arena peopled by flickering holograms of bygone stars (Sinatra, Monroe, Elvis, Liberace), which for me encapsulated the whole movie: a feast for the eyes but overkill for the brain. High concept - low impact. Don Siegel's 1955 INVASION OF THE BODY-SNATCHERS is still my favourite sci-fi.Doubtless the fault is with me but I came away, as I did from INCEPTION and SHUTTER ISLAND, with the feeling that I'd been looking at the Emperor's New Clothes. I wouldn't say Don't go to see this picture, but be prepared to be very (very) bewildered."
280," Not Blown Away.
","bladerunner2049 was a good film overall however i wouldn't say it was a masterpiece Or as spectacular & mesmerizing as been made out to be by the media, and yes they've used Jared to hype it up & just like they did with suicide squad and his joker performance. His scenes were short & sweet and probably cut. Jared is not in it long at all. Such a shame he was really good whilst on screen & i wanted Niander to have more of a story. The nexus dawn prequel i watched prior on YouTube lures you in & having liked the original from a young age, i just had to see it. However i wouldn't say i was blown away by it and in all honesty i expected more. But I'm not #easilyimpressed other people may love it and think I'm totally wrong but that's just my honest opinion. don't believe the hype Overrated!"
281," Laborious, felt I was watching paint dry..
","How on the earth did this become a movie?? The visuals were stunning, Atari is still a thing and sony somehow survived, but the whole movie felt like there was no story, no backbone and GOD was it long... Don't watch this just don't you're better off spending your money in the pub!Beer is a such a better alternative to this, sorry but this is nothing like the original which had grit, backbone and a much better storyline which didn't keep me waiting till I feel asleep."
282," I've... seen things you people wouldn't believe...
","...I've seen an amazing story removed of all subtlety and replaced with religious drivel wrapped up in a series of mindless, pointless action scenes with no explanation or point. Do you think that how in futuristic films there's often ecological ruin as a cautionary aspect, that the new Blade Runner is so bad to serve as a warning about the decline of cinematic values? If so then it's a masterpiece. If not, well...I am a huge fan of the original, usually mentioning it as one of my all time favourite films. I watched 2049 with some trepidation and yet was still massively disappointed and even a bit insulted. The plot was ridiculous and had religious tones, with the replicants referring to a 'miracle' and 'souls' over and over with what is honestly quite an impossible occurrence of one of them giving birth. I decided to just allow myself to believe this could happen but the film only got worse from there on. By the end I was so disinterested in what happened that I didn't even care about the death of K, arguably the only ambiguous part of the whole film. The original had masterful subtlety and ambiguity and left you seriously pondering the issues around AI. The original 'villains' had motives and depth, whereas in this the villains are mindless inhuman sadists with no substance whatsoever. This is a load of tarted up trash. You can slap a load of slick (yet uninventive) special effects on a bad story but it is still a bad story. Forgettable, insipid, insulting trash. I'd even recommend that there's more to be gotten from simply rewatching the original, especially since the new film brings no new ideas whatsoever. I wish I had."
283," Harrison Ford in a T-Shirt
","I wasn't exactly on fire to see this, but got the opportunity to see it for free and it hasn't made much of an impression on me. Nothing really stayed with me in terms of story or performance. It has too many anomalies and implausibilities not to mention it's fairly mundane in the way it plays out. WHY would a functional replicant be retired when all the guy was doing was growing protein on a farm (ya know, for humans?)HOW is it, the hero is a replicant that bleeds and has real childhood memories? WHY are the pair running the new Tyrell Corporation dealio so evil? Tyrell himself was a super-powerful but benevolent man which seems to me to be more apropos and more interesting. Why resort to the boring evil megalomaniac clich√©? Rachel copy has the wrong color eyes - so they shoot her in the head on the spot, WHAT? We find out Rachel had a functional womb here but there was no mention or hint of that in the original Blade Runner. Harrison Ford looked utterly ridiculous and out of place in this, traipsing around in an ironed t-shirt like he's been moving furniture out to the guest house on a Sunday afternoon or something."
284," Llacks the passion and desperation of the original.
","Blade Runner is a cult favourite, with its futuristic visions and the way it asked questions about humanity and being human. Equally riveting was the pace and plot. As Deckard fought for his life against physically superior replicants. Then, there was the romantic relationship between Dckard and Rachel, the beautifully cool replicant.This 2049 version is merely an extension of the original film. Stylistically and creatively, it does not break new ground. Though there are clever ideas and a great deal of detail.In terms of human interest, I found it hard to empathize with K because it didn't have enough of an inner life. Granted that K has an interesting relationship with a virtual girlfriend.Other weaknesses include the lack of a terrifying killer replicant like Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer). The mad genius played by Leto just does not match the mania of Joe Turkel's Dr Tyrell. Nor the other interesting characters populating the original film.The bottom line is that the film has a great deal of creative input, but lacks the passion and desperation of the original."
285," Meh - if you liked the original, you will probably like this; if not, maybe rent at home.
","I watched this movie with friends on the first night it was released in Canada. It was surprisingly not busy at the theatre, but that may have correlated to the weekend also being Thanksgiving.If you watched the original Blade Runner (1982) you are probably going to like this movie but I do not imagine it having the same appeal as the original. I think one of the reasons why Blade Runner was such a big hit/cult classic back in the 80s was because this may have been one of the first science fiction movies to tell this kind of story along with all the ""advances"" in technology so well. Blade Runner 2049 does not have anything new, special, or different from any other sci-fi movie that has been released in the past 10 years. Now I did not watch the original until hours before I watched Blade Runner 2049, and I will admit, the original was mostly boring and it was hard to sit through. This trend also happens in Blade Runner 2049, because, well it's a 2 hour and 45 minute movie! I enjoyed the story, the cinematography, the music was AMAZING, and the acting was good. My one question to the director is, ""WHY DOES EVERYONE WALK SO SLOW IN 2049?"" Some scene's dragged a bit, and the first hour of the movie seemed to be spent explaining the backstory of Blade Runners and the world in 2049; which is OK because I understood exactly why and what was happening. For those that are expecting an action-packed, adrenaline rush, non-stop gun fire and on the edge of your seat action¬Öthis is not for you. It may be that as a society we are now expecting the comic book/superhero kind of movies that are non-stop action the entire time, with a mush of underdeveloped characters that just end of together someone and become best friends; so if you want something a little more deep and developed, Blade Runner 2049 may be up your alley.Blade Runner 2049 will be loved by a very specific small niche audience, and others may just feel ""meh"" about the movie. I think this movie is good, and I'm glad I saw it, but because it was almost 3 hours long, it may be a stay-at-home kind of movie (where you can pause and go grab a snack, or go to the washroom)."
286," Blade Runner 2049 Revitalizes an Imperfect Masterpiece
","For several decades Ridley Scott has tried to fix his iconic but lacking, Blade Runner. Many recuts¬†moved the film closer to what he originally envisioned, but further away from a good film. My personal preference is the first 1982 cut.With the long-gestating sequel, the simple story of a cop and an android that fall in love is expanded into the epic saga that Scott originally envisioned, with special effects technology worthy of the grand vision of a dystopian future, not unlike our current world, with systemic prejudice, inequality, and injustice.The sequel makes the first Blade Runner better. Let's hope this is a trilogy.It's for this reason that Denis Villeneuve's brilliantly conceived and executed sequel makes the original better. He turns Deckard into a flesh and blood character, even with minimal screen time.This movie is a great example of how reboots are usually more successfully achieved by an outside artist. For a while, Ridley Scott himself was going to direct the sequel. He says he didn't have time in his schedule, given that he's busy rebooting his other masterwork, the Alien franchise.Bringing in a fan to direct Blade Runner 2049, someone who was clearly influenced by the original, and a talented new storyteller, with something to say, has given this franchise a needed injection of freshness.In this sequel, K discovers the remains of the body of a woman who has died in childbirth. But the big surprise is that she's a replicant. Suddenly, we know where this story is going. The woman is clearly Rachel, the replicant love interest of Deckard's. He's obviously the father.The driving force of the narrative is for K to solve the mystery‚Äîwhere is the father and who is the child. K slowly begins to discover clues that suggest that he may be that missing son. His character is given really interesting colors to play with, as he comes to accept that his memories may, in fact, be real.Read full review HERE: https://wademann.net/movies/blade-runner-2049- revitalizes-imperfect-masterpiece/"
287," Hated it
",Jarring sound effects.Characters that you don't care about.Dark and depressing.No explanation for why there aren't more people around.I mean what is the purpose of it all.Just an awful film.
288," How tedious and boring...please stop!
","Saw this movie last night...and boy was it a tedious, overly long watch! This movie felt like having to do overtime at work. Dennis Villeneuve is a terrific director, loved ""Sicario"" and ""Arrival"", but this was a misfire in every possible way.An uninteresting story, the script is just muddled, highly convenient and disappointingly pedestrian. While the first movie retained, despite notable differences, the spirit and essence of Phillip K. Dick's amazing novel ""Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep"", ""Blade Runner 2049"" is at best an outlier, the story having been diluted to nothingness. Ryan Gosling is completely miscast in the role, as I knew he would, the guy just doesn't cut it. Harrison Ford just looked bored, bored with acting and bored having to revisit these characters he clearly doesn't want to but for the paycheque. Much like he was in ""The Force Awakens"".The problem is that Ford gets paid to look bored, whereas I have to pay to watch him looking bored. Maybe retirement is in order.Jared Leto is just awful and does nothing but look menacing or foreboding, the only expressions he seems capable of, either in the movies or music videos he makes. I am not exactly sure how and why this guy continues to be cast in anything these days.Losing Johann Johansson as the composer for the soundtrack was also big mistake. Hans Zimmer is usually a good, reliable, composer but when he misses, he misses big. The score is terrible. It's just noise...heavy, loud noise and when it isn't, it sounds like what would have happened if the soundtrack for ""Inception"" and Vangelis's original score for""Blade Runner"" had a baby.The use of 3D is also completely useless here and I think, it detracts from the movie and it's visual narrative. The visuals and special effects everybody seems to be applauding, were, I found, lost in an unnecessary murkiness and annoying, orange tinged twilight.Roger Deakin is one of the best cinematographers ever, and for example there were some shots in ""Sicario"" which took my breath away, not so in this movie. He missed the mark here. In ""Blade Runner 2049"", never for a moment did I experience the feeling of awe I did, and still do, when I watched the original, especially the opening scene. (Do a search on Syd Mead and then you will know why the original ""Blade Runner"" looked and felt the way it did.)The bit towards the end with Rachel and the use of the character and employment of the technology came off as cheap and an unnecessary add-on. Something like that worked very well in ""Rogue One: A Star Wars Story"", here it doesn't. It is not an awful movie, or one of those ""the worst I've seen"" types, but it cannot hold a candle to the original on any account. It is too long, too boring for long stretches and in the end it just left me with a headache as well as mostly indifferent.I never wanted a sequel for ""Blade Runner"" and ""Blade Runner 2049"" proves why."
289," Surprisingly dull
","Disappointing. Considering its length, not much happened. Some arty visuals. Self-indulgent, clich√©d."
290," Boring - Contains Spoilers (right at the end sort of)
","After the disappointment of the force rebooted this was the only other film this year I was actually waiting to see so it was with high hopes and fingers crossed that I went to the cinema today to watch this movie. Sadly it would seem I had my second movie disappointment of the year.The plot for this movie wanders around and doubles back trying to make you think one thing and then another slowly and drearily getting to the only point it has to make right at the very end. The pacing is slow and tedious and not a patch on the original movie with non of the originals edge.As for the aesthetic in places it almost looks like the first movie but misses and then in others its miles away. Very few of the scenes looked like they could of been placed in the original most looked like wannabee copies and somehow just fail to come upto the original.It's not the fault of the actors it just doesn't feel like they were given much to work with. The over concept is a great idea however the execution is sadly lacking.The whole movie felt lame and drawn out like 30 mins of story spread over 163 mins of film, there were loads of long meandering slow scenes and should of ended up on the cutting room floor they just destroyed the pacing. At one point I actually closed my eyes and thought I might just fall asleep only to hear snoring from another viewer behind me which made me laugh.Goslings and Fords performances were great considering how little they had to work with and Jared Leto felt menacing but very very under utilised. Ana de Armas is stunning and played her part well as were/did Mackenzie Davis and Sylvia Hoeks (there's no way you'd want to be on the wrong side of Luv).Overall the movie felt too long, too slow and not enough story which is a shame as the plot seemed almost decent.SPOILERLY BIT Making K/Joe think he was the one and then it turning out not to be him was just lame and not done very well at all.This movie isn't worth paying to see wait until it's on your favourite streaming service.Just a note to the movie industry who claim many many things are killing the movie business I think the one thing that actually is killing the movie business is lack of originality/reboots/remakes and just general tardiness. I've not seen a good original movie for ages or a sequel that does justice to the original movie/series."
291," Lacking Intelligence - SPOILER
","No complaints about the casting, performance, or any of that, and special kudos to Ana de Armas who is luminous. The special effects are persuasive. So what's the problem?Like too many of Villeneuve's movies, this one is incredibly . . . dumb. NONE of the projections made about the world of 2049 make any sense at all. (This was not a problem with the original). Between now and then, we are asked to believe society will create an entire race of replicant human beings, the climate will be uniformly gray and dreary, all traces of urban sophistication or beauty will disappear, and all of this (of course) accepted without a whimper I'll leave the absurdities about climate and environment and focus on one thing - artificial intelligence. We DO have it, right now, and it has nothing to do with human DNA. It takes the form of robots made of plastic and metal elements, doing repetitive mindless work that human beings used to do, which is great for the time being, but poses a problem for the future. There aren't replicants now, there are never going to be, which makes the whole futuristic scenario an exercise in futility.SPOILER - by miles the worst scene is when the replicant detective (Gosling) stumbles in to an orphanage in which these poor little tykes are working in dark, claustrophobic conditions. Are you kidding me? Not only are these Dickensian scenes 150 years out of date, but any manufacturer is going to find regular robots far more efficient than a passel of children.All this may sound picky, but it's not. I love science fiction, but you have to have premises that relate to realistic social or human conditions. These don't. I strongly suspect Villeneuve came up with this implausible scenario so we can be told that 'no society ever succeeded other than on the basis of enforced labor' - dead wrong - and other holier-than-thou statements. The picture ends up having the same, narky feel as 'Incendies' or 'Prisoners', which is not where you want to be,Dystopian drama? Sure. Dystopian fantasy? Who needs that - which is why this movie is a grossly miscalculated boondoggle."
292," This was not what I expected it to be
","The story might've been good, definitely a few surprises along the road, the acting was superb. But you can't overlook the serious slow paste of events to point that you actually loose interest in the movie and you better be careful not to get distracted or elce you would miss the point. They could've made way more with this if only they have gone with a shorter run time and a soundtrack slightly better than alpha wave sleeping music."
293," Ugh...A Tedious Mess
","Two words of advice to Denis Villeneuve on directing upcoming Dune redo... Story-Boards.There seems to be no planning involved in BR-2049. Just LONG drawn-out dreary scenes with occasional meaningless dialogue delivered in mumbled whispers by a talented, but poorly utilized (and clearly bored) cast.Roger Deakins' cinematography is the only ""bright spot"" in this tedious film, and for his brilliant (as usual) work, the movie goes from a 1 to a 2 rating.Perhaps Dennis was thinking at some point in making this film ""just let Roger do his thing, and perhaps the audience will overlook the unengaging scenes and dialogue.""But even Deakins cannot save this film. which begs to be cut down by 45 minutes (another word of advice to the Director - EDIT!)I am certain many will rave about Blade Runner 2049 - I am just not one of them, and calling it like I see it - I cannot fathom how any critic can honestly give this movie a good review.This is pure dribble and now my ""worse movie of 2017"" choice. Not an easy feat as this year has been one of the worst for new production releases. I just hope there is not another release this year that ranks lower. üòë"
294," Extraordinary
","First of all , the cast perfectly fits to film and the film was better than what i expected.The storyline was great , the acting superb they act like they're living it.The effects were made the film better and if you're in a confusion about to watch or not to watch I think not a think i definitely recommended to watch it.Although everything you ain't gonna lose anything , and i believe that you're gonna like it."
295," Either equal, or superior than its predecessor. Denis is the future.
","Director Denis Villeneuve promised Blade Runner's sequel is good hands when he accepted to direct one the most influential films of all time, and he kept his promise; Blade Runner 2049 follows up with a darker world than what Ridley Scott imagined, yet keeping the very same charm Ridley worked hard on. It is also the best looking movie ever created, Roger Deakins will never top his cinematography here ever.What makes this film special is all cast and crew were either fans of the original, or worked on the original; they all knew this can only be phenomenal, and with their teamwork, the sequel was beyond phenomenal. The core philosophy of the movie, like the original is still what it means to be human is still a major topic and it vastly more explored here than the first film; told through replicant's obsession with love of another person mainly. Acting was top on everyone's end; Gosling, Ford, Armas, Leto, and Bautista. It sadly lacks Leto and Bautista, those 2 characters had an instant connection to the audience, perfectly played. Gosling here is like how he was in Drive, only obviously speaks more, however, it can be an award winning role for him as officer K.Setting is how Ridley Scott planned his original only in the future environment got worse, the cyberpunk, and neo-noir look never looked so beautiful and its so pleasing to see it returning after a long time. Each frame is an art in this movie, it is the most beautiful looking movie ever made, minimal CGI, and lots of special effects. Denis was so key about the lighting effects in the film, the lighting made the film look breathtaking. The soundtrack, every time a futurist score plays, goosebumps and chills, the feeling brings you into that world.Story wise, like the original; classic detective in the future, investigation with a dark past, and can lead to a dark future; Agent K takes a case which leads him to look for Deckard (the question of Deckard being human and replicant is asked again by the way). Like all Denis movies, there is always more to the main plot, it will look a story of one character, but ends up telling someone else's story, and this is done through a huge reveal or twist which was a ""wow"" moment I have not felt in a long time. You can skip the original Blade Runner, but it is highly advised you watch The Final Cut version before seeing this since there are many nods to the original film. Watching the original film, like ""Skin jobs,"" VK test (sort of), an opening credit, ""retirement,"" and unicorns as well. There is also another character other than Deckard who returned.... Watching the original will enhance the experience, and help you appreciate the story here a lot more.Once upon a time, Terminator 2 was called the greatest sequel ever, that time is now over; Blade Runner 2049 is the best sequel in history; keeps the charm of the original, but introduces fresh new elements, in the most amazing cinematography ever. Watch it on a big screen, because looks and surround sound will give you the best experience possible. Enjoy Blade Runner 2049, it may one day become as important as the original Blade Runner."
296," excruciatingly slow and morose
","The only reason I gave this a 2, instead of a 1 is for the superb sound mixing. This is an excellent example of a lack of good editing. It was at least an hour too long. How this movie got anything over a 4 is mind boggling! People must be judging it on the special effects alone. I disliked this for so many reasons. The story has too many flaws (Bees? There is no vegetation?), the pacing is excruciatingly slow, all the characters are one dimensional, there is almost no meaningful dialogue, the violence is unnecessarily graphic, all the women are depicted as either psychopathic killers or prostitutes (with only one exception, the pitiful ""dreamer""). Did I even mention the pornigraphic statues? My best guess is this was an homage to a ""Clockwork Orange"".I could have had a more enjoyable experience watching an episode of CSI. It was like they couldn't decide whether to be a sequel or a horror movie. Sequel won, but horror movie would have worked better. There were so many scenes that could have benefited from a jump scare. It was filmed as such, with the creepy music (again the best part), the character standing alone with vast empty spaces behind them, unknown people chasing them. But they just left the character standing there. It was like a bunch of jokes with no punchlines.The holographic girlfriend was annoying and pointless. The ""sex"" scene was annoying and incomplete. It was like watching my IPad buffer. And who didn't see her demise coming a mile away. Yawn.Ryan Gossling gets more unattractive to me with each additional bad movie. If I was Harrison Ford I would have punched him for real too."
297," An insult to fans specifically, and cinematography in general
","What an utter turd.... Playing with four Lego blocks for the duration would be more entertaining. DO NOT fall for the crap 10-star reviews, the are simply a lie. I am a big fan of the 1982 version, which I watch at least once a year. I had great anticipation for the 2049 version. Watching it left me with a feeling like frying the perfect steak and then dropping it into a turd by accident...avoid and do not waste your time and money. It's like ""The Hitcher"" and it's sequel all over again....I must be getting old."
298," Still Controversial
","The original Blade Runner was always a controversial film. Some saw it as a cinematic masterpiece while others didn't see the point of the film. Many years later, the original still brings in new fans whether it was because of hearing that there are 7 versions of the film, out of pure interest, or because of this new masterpiece.Blade Runner 2049 captures the same controversy as the original. Some people love and appreciate the dialogue, every pause, and the cinematography. Others feel the film drags.Blade Runner 2049 is not meant for everyone. It is a film that was made for people to think about, just as the original. Most people leave the film wondering what they just witnessed, and for some this becomes a fascination which makes the film great. Every time the film is watched there are new details your eyes and ears capture. This tends to grow into conversations on forums and Youtube comment sections. Then there are others who don't care and move on. AND THAT'S OK.I thought the film was mesmerizing from start to finish. Just the curiosity of seeing the next shot is something I haven't felt while watching a film in recent years. While the film is obviously meant to be artistic visually, it is the deeper meaning of each scene that boggles my mind.Blade Runner has always been a film ahead of it's time. It attempts to truly capture both your senses. Your eyes and ears are filled with unique sounds and visions that when blended, create a dynamic atmosphere.Some of the themes in the film that seem futuristic and sci-fi like will most likely become more relevant as we head into our future. When you go and see this film for the first time, just go in there and take in the view. Then go back and watch the film again looking for the details within each scene.I do warn casual film-goers that this is not your typical action flick, adventure flick, nor sci-fi flick. If you want to see that, Star Wars is coming out at the end of this year."
299," A Masterpiece Like The Original
","I love the original from Ridley Scott. It's a masterpiece of a film. Especially the final cut which is what 2049 is a follow up to. So, let me tell you straight up, if you hated the original, if you hate slow films, if you hate films in general, why are you even here? Anyways if you said yes to the above, you probably have a good chance of claiming 2049 to be boring, mundane, waste of time etc and please stop reading this.But the rest of you who are still reading this, Blade Runner 2049 is a sequel that not only lives up to the original, but also MAY even surpass it. The original film had an impact on the industry, influencing countless films after it's release. I feel that 2049 may generate a similar impact. It remind us why films exist. This is the film that will encourage and influence upcoming filmmakers to just grab a camera immediately and make films. (or maybe discourage too, cause lets be real we won't be the next Roger Deakins or Denis Villeneuve. We won't be on their level. Oh god, this is starting to get depressing) It will bring a new batch of audiences into the world of film.Unlike other cash grab sequels that choose to sell tickets, by over relying on their intellectual properties, 2049 is the rare sequel that honors what its predecessor was. That was what Denis Villeneuve promised us. He did not want any other director to mess up a sequel to Blade Runner and took the challenge of making the film himself. He transport us back to the world we love, as well as, the noir aspects that was what made the original iconic. The visuals are breathtaking. You can freeze frame any frame from the film and gape in pure orgasmic levels. Roger Deakins man, he needs to get that Oscar for this. The whole production design and sound design is so atmospheric transcending you into the world. The visuals may be one of the few things that clearly surpass the original.Other than the visuals being iconic in the original, the original was profoundly emotional and intimate. However, based off my initial reaction, 2049 has more emotional impact. It brings us down deeper layers than just making us question whether Harrison Ford is a replicant. It is way bigger than that, trust me, no spoilers. Speaking of Harrison Ford, this is that career revisiting role that can be phenomenal or just plain old phoning it in. And let me tell you, it was the former of the two. Just like Stallone did in Creed, Ford gave his all and we haven't even seen this side of him, no, not even in Force Awakens.Ryan Gosling is a leading man. Are we still questioning that? Alright I will admit, La La Land Ryan Gosling was alright, he wasn't great or anything. But come on, Gosling can carry a film. Note I said film, not movie. His character is the one audiences follow and his journey is so riveting and visceral. Along the way he is being supported by Ana de Armas and Sylvia Hoeks. I won't spoil their characters but boy, were they intriguing and engaging to watch. Jared Leto and Dave Bautista isn't in the film as much but they were great too.As perfect as I want the film to be, it wasn't. But I only have nitpicks. I don't like certain uses of flashbacks and in moments, like certain shots and scenes felt a little overlong. Yeah, minor problems that can be forgotten easily and please don't use as an excuse to make into different cuts. (Yeah I am looking at you Ridley)In the end, 2049 just proves, yet again, Director Denis Villeneuve is the new master director. Similar to how Kubrick, Hitchcock, Scorsese was to their generations when they were at their peaks, Denis Villeneuve is for our modern generation. I say, give him anything he wants, Dune, Cleopatra, James Bond, Star Wars. Every film he directed so far, I love. OK fine, Maelstrom was weird, I didn't get it. And 2049 may easily be my favorite of his films. It will be interesting to watch how he will progress from here on out and where his journey will take him. Blade Runner 2049 is a film from a huge fan of the original. Strictly a film, not a movie. Don't go in expecting a popcorn action flick that features robot, well in this case, replicant testicles, (F TRANSFORMERS 2, whatever it is called)."
300," K-rap
","Sci-fi seems to have been appropriated and now means 'about nothing so long as the date is sometime in the future'. The original Blade Runner was a detective story not dissimilar to something Humphrey Bogart might have been in. The original Alien was a slasher horror film not dissimilar to Halloween or Friday 13th. The latest Ridley Scott facsimiles (Prometheus & BR 2049) have no underlying style and are therefore boring, slipping in some quasi-Christian rubbish to an otherwise inferior copy of the original films.To sum up, these films are cheating us by copying & pasting a few minutes from a successful film into a boring, going nowhere film and expecting it to fly."
301," Totally disappointed
","It's been awhile since i see such a bad film. Studio throw too much budget on marketing this thing. If you can please invest such money to the film, it would be better. Lousy trailer, Worth sound, bad acting, the worst film story ever and the theme is so dark that you just don't want to live in the future anymore"
302," I mean honestly, adding vfx is cinema? U gotta be kidding
","I don't know where are you from
But where am from for a movie , three things are necessary. An interesting plot,good acting and a thrilling story which slowly unravels itself.I have seen some good ol tarkovsky cinema and Kubrick's masterpieces
They were called arthouse cinema because directors back then used to capture environment in a different manner in a one single movieAdding vfx rain,smoke, neon light is art house? Showing it repeatedly throughout the entire movie is brilliant?I see people are here commenting on Ana de armas,on her shape n how she portrayed an A.I. while wearing a single piece of cloth..
People are rating it 9, 10?Where was the story? What's interesting in it? Where's the danger, where's the risk?
Ryan gosling is an average actor!
Adding only vfx does not make a cinema stand!
Grow up , Hollywood people
Cinema is loosing its value ."
303," What a disappointment.
","I am one of the biggest Blade Runner fans on the planet. My license plate reflects that. I had no intention of watching another ""Blade Runner"" movie, since, well, it was done. But when I found out Harrison Ford was attached to the project, I knew it had to be something special. He had vowed he would never reprise that role. I wish he hadn't. This movie is a lot like the book ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep"". Things randomly happen for no apparent reason. It is completely disjointed. It played like a script by committee. I was going to wait to buy a DVD box set until this was added. I won't anymore. This will never be be a classic. 3 hours of my life I will never get back. It was pointless."
304," Masterpiece or pale imitation?
","I went to see the film on the day of release, 5 October 2017, in an almost empty theatre. I loved the original Blade Runner, and had mixed feelings about the prospect of a sequel. Denis Villeneuve had taken over directing from Ridley Scott, and I had admired the work he did on Enemy and Arrival, he seemed to be a good choice to helm this film, so I went in with an open mind.A few positive reviews for the film had appeared online in the last days before its release, but I had held off from reading more than a couple. Once I seen the film I went back and saw that many people were hailing it a 'masterpiece', 'the perfect sequel', or even 'better than the original'. I was really quite stunned by this, as I couldn't share the same enthusiasm for the film.So what can I say about the film? Don't worry, if you haven't seen it there won't be any spoilers. It is a well made film, very ably directed by Denis Villeneuve. The main problem I had with it is that it is indebted to the first film in pretty much every way. The look of the film is largely recreating that of the 1982 original, the story is just a remix of the same themes and ideas from the original, and the soundtrack is little more than an echo of Vangelis's memorable score. It was as if the film makers had taken the original and created a copy, quite ironic really.It made me think of art forgery. You could have 2 paintings side by side. One a Picasso, the other a forgery. They might look the same, and it does take undeniable skill to create a convincing forgery. But a forgery is totally devoid of originality, that is the difference between a masterpiece and a copy. All the positive reasons people gave in their reviews for the sequel lead back to the original.At the end of Ridley Scott's 1982 original film, Deckard and Rachel head off together into an uncertain future. It was an open ending, but perfect for the story the film told. The uncertainties of life are something we have to live with as human beings, we didn't need to know what happened next to those characters, what was important is that they had a future together.If you are a fan of the original, and haven't seen Blade Runner 2049 yet, I would say to remember that what is seen cannot be unseen. Once you see the sequel you will never be able to go back and watch the original without knowing what fate had in store for Deckard and Rachel, I think this is a great pity, and does a disservice to that film.Whose decision was it that we needed to have this sequel? Over the past few years Ridley Scott has been putting out unnecessary prequels to Alien, so I can't help but think he is responsible. It is now just over a week since the sequel came out and there are reports that it is a box-office flop. Some comments I have read said that this happened to the original film too. Maybe, but I think for different reasons. The original was way ahead of its time, and it took time for people to catch up appreciate it. This sequel was a film that I don't think there was any real demand for, and although the levels of hype are high, I think in time people we see the film for what it really is."
305," Boring
",Very overrated film. Far to long. Very boring. Not worthy going to cinema to see. It looks a bit cool and the soundtrack is good but the plot is thin and only gets thinner. Could be OK to look at home if you liked the first one and have absolutely nothing to do with your time. Ryan Gosling and Harrison Ford look strangely out of place being a good actors both of them.
306," Disappointing
","I suppose we were lulled into thinking, after the excellent Arrival, that Denis Villeneuve would be the perfect person to helm a follow-up to Ridley Scott's masterpiece. Sadly this failed to fly - the plodding plot, the ever-wooden Ryan Gosling and the over-reliance on CGI combined to make a sterile spectacle. It did pick up when Harrison returned and redeemed the show somewhat. But where the feather-light dance of Vangelis' extraordinary score for Bladerunner cut through and elevated the gothic dystopia in the original, here the thundering of Hans Zimmer only added to the gloom. About two thirds of the way through, someone in the theatre I was in yawned loudly. Instead of being annoyed, laughter rippled through the audience. Yeah, the critics will love it, the rest of us will fall asleep. As I said, disappointing."
307," Beautifully bleak
","Bladerunner 2049 is a faithful successor to the original in that it doesn't try to appease the 'fidget spinner' generation who need fast cuts and yappy dialogue to sustain their limited attention spans.Its languid, methodical pace allows the viewer to soak up every ounce of atmosphere in each gorgeously rendered frame, to feel totally immersed in the haunting bleakness of it all. As the camera rises through colossal cityscapes permeated with smog and glowing neon, as the synths ebb and surge like waves, there is a sense of desolation and ruin, a consumerist culture turned cancer that has driven humanity to a dark place figuratively and spiritually.The plot unravels slowly, with no great urgency, but it is nonetheless intriguing, as Bladerunner K's world is shaken by the discovery of a replicant's 'miracle birth' and his road to finding the child leads him to experience the emotions and value decisions which ultimately make us human. These existential themes are what Bladerunner has always been about, rather than explosive, pounding action sequences -though there are sporadic moments of action, it's not the emphasis. So if you go to this film and encounter people yawning, chances are they had the wrong expectations.Gosling and Ford are as watchable as always, but the female characters are particularly engaging. Robin Wright oozes authority as the tough as nails Lieutenant Joshi. Ana de Armas has a difficult task in trying to make her character, Joi (K's perfect hologram girlfriend) feel sympathetic, but the innocent exuberance she displays as she tries to navigate the boundaries of her own virtual existence in her relationship with K is affecting. The main antagonist, Luv, played with ice-cold menace by Sylvia Hoeks, is a real standout. Perhaps the first female villain I've watched who doesn't come off as titular, she is a very threatening presence throughout the film. The only strike for me was Jared Leto's performance as the evil Niander, who's lofty haiku dialogue and John Malkovich style cadence felt overplayed and camp.I think fans of the original Bladerunner will enjoy this sequel and even if you are not that engaged with the minutia of the story, there is much to enjoy on a scene by scene basis. For me I was totally lost in the mood and even at 160 minutes, it didn't feel wasted. Of course there are those who will dismiss it as too slow and boring; With the way movies are edited today, it's not surprising, but it is a shame. Bladerunner 2049 is art."
308," Needs Cutting
","Great movie but way too long... needs to be cut down to say, two hours or less...On the plus side: Ryan Gosling and most of the main actors. Great cinematography, sets and effects, appropriately clangorous music.On the minus side: Unbelievable Wallace character, overacted by Jared Leto; unbelievable and sentimentalising relationship with 'virtual' female companion for K, too much screen time spent wallowing in this - the noir type hero should go home and drink his whisky alone! Also,some plot doubtfuls: Firstly, K's ability to crash through walls without suffering any damage...Secondly, how his flying car ploughs through iron and steel junk without breaking the window glass, and, after that, how can the bad girl obliterate the crowd of attackers so that there are not even any bodies left when K walks from his vehicle? Thirdly: why the heck do the assassins leave K alive when they abduct Deckard... doesn't make any sense... except as what it crassly is: to save him for the big showdown at the end..."
309," My Views On Blade Runner 2049 and a dash of film industry commentary
","Perusing the reviews one easily notices a verifiable pattern of love it or hate it emerging throughout the page.I was predisposed to the film given my admiration of the original. The original sits proudly on my DVD shelf while Dick's novel is not far away among my books.BR2049 is indeed awe-inspiring in its graphics and visuals. I can imagine seeing the original in the cinema back in 1982 would have done the same for those viewers. What is more, the women are beautiful and there I admit it attractive women draw me in. The music puts in a good attempt of being equal to Vangelis and his art. No one would be able to match that of course but the effort and artistic merit is there. The morale and message to the audience is lofty and worthwhile and it is not preached without a measure of subtlety, which is appreciated.With that said, and I was somewhat partial also because of the lead Canadian actor and Canadian director, the film is too long. I do not have statistics, but these films have lost the art of editing. Lights go down ten minutes after they are supposed to, a mobile game plays to garner loyalty to the cinema chain and debit card, fifteen minutes of trailers and unwanted commercials kick in for me to buy a car, a chocolate bar and get yet another credit card that will sell my information and lose it to NSA hackers and then we have the film itself. The film was good and immersive, but who authorizes the non-edits?I liked it but all in all this film reminds one why we should not pay to watch the next six Star Trek sequels and why it is very smart to boycott the next dozen Star Wars films and Marvel's weekly release schedule. Seriously."
310," Hated it that much I left after 90 minutes
","It's not often I have felt the need to leave a cinema before the end of a film but after 90 minutes my patience snapped. It felt like I was watching the coursework of someone studying special effects at film making school. Scenery is only entertaining for so long and I was longing for something to happen but it seemed all of the action was over in the first 5 minutes. There wasn't even any tension to keep me on the edge of my seat, just a lot scenery, Ryan Gosling's blank face and NOTHING happening! I loved the original and this film did generate the same environment but they didn't need to keep showing me that over and over to convince me. It needed more to keep my attention and after a couple of 5 minute reprieves I broke and left the cinema. For anyone mildly interested I was watching the IMAX 3D version so had paid considerably for the experience of being bored out of my brain but the realisation this time would never come back stirred me to leave and go home where I knew there were some decent films waiting for me."
311," Tired of the Hollywood Hype Machine
","I made sure to re-watch the original the day before we saw 2049. I can't imagine how lost or uninterested an audience member must have been if they've never seen the first installment.I can write a review conveying how shockingly slow and dull this movie is, but it looks like there are plenty of review writers who have already done that. Yes, there are some occasional brilliant scenes and cutting edge sci-fi, but for the most part,""excruciating"" is the word that comes to mind.For me, however, the real issue is I am tired of the hype machine. The last three movies I have seen in the cinema this year are Planet of the Apes, Logan Lucky, and Blade Runner. Each and every one was lavished with stellar reviews and praise from IMDb users, Metacritic reviews, and various magazines and websites. All three were terrible. I am sick and tired of the phony reviews and the complicit media trying to prop up the movie industry, and will now be much more skeptical before rushing to the cinema to spend my hard-earned money."
312," Worst waste of time!!!
","If you want to kill 3 hours for some boring movie go on it..
Better to watch the 5th Element again..(even twice)"
313," So dull I fell asleep
","The original had a story that was clear and a driving narrative. This had effects over story and even the music was a copy ... of Vangelis. It was just plain dull. I kept wondering when Harrison Ford would appear and live up to the posters ( the last 10 minutes ). A lot of directors have made the mistake of concentrating on Ryan Gosling's face in the belief that the camera can see him think. He's no Eastwood, or Jimmy Stewart. Another fault of sci-fi films are the lengthy speeches about the state of the the outer quadrant, and the reasons why Tharg must be destroyed etc etc. This was no different. There was the Robin Wright character, Jared Leto, et al. I liked the abandoned casino set. Something for the eye to rest on and take the whole story in. The original had much of this. This hadn't. The use of original footage was gratuitous, and by then I had stopped caring. So many movies this year have had good posters but poor product:The Dark Tower, Kingsman, And now this."
314," Lacking plot
","The hype got us going, the film sent us to sleep. The monochrome scenes in which everything was covered in light brown dust abounded. Many times we were left staring at dust, then we stared at Ryan Gosling staring at dust, then there would be a cut back to the dust. Maybe there would be a glow in the dust I don't know maybe not, was I asleep or awake right there - hard to tell. The film was terrorized by the myth of its predecessor and dared not do anything aside from throwing some shade with a shed load of dust and a thousand thousand yards of staring.They forgot the colour, not just in itself, not just in the monochrome vistas, but in terms of vivacity of the scenes, of peoples actions, and of their expressions which would have been a great counterbalance to many, many very slow scenes."
315," This Blade Runner does not run
","1 hour too long and you will fall asleep at times.
Visually it is great, but half this movie is riding around in the flying car from one place to the next all at the slowest pace possible.
Way overrated by ""the critics"""
316," Stupefylngly Dull
","Truly I thought I was watching the ""Heaven's Gate"" of sci-fi. Every beautiful shot goes on and on and on until you scream ""move along, already!"" The reward for this butt-numbing length is a plot minimal to the point of nonexistence, and a resolution so trivial it could barely anchor a soap opera. If I hadn't known better I would judge from his performance that Ryan Gosling couldn't act his way through a Cheerios commercial. He wears a completely blank expression bleaching any emotional impact out of a scene, even as his virtual girlfriend finds a way to make love to him for the first time. Wait for it on video, as it's only endurable on 4X fast forward. In installments."
317," Despite the news slamming it's box office revenue, this is a good film.
","The new Blade runner is not going to be for everybody, make no mistake about that, it's not your conventional blockbuster movie and that is why you should consider watching it. For years the movie industry has focused it's attention on mostly genre films like the superhero films that are dominating the big and small screens. For a gem like Blade Runner 2049, we get a film that wishes to challenge the conventions of today's Hollywood films. The film is indeed long and focuses less on big action sequences and more on character and plot. You are not going to get your finale climactic battle scene and the evil scientists corporate headquarters or a spectacular gunfight, it's not that kind of film. The film is about a man named K who must find out the origins of a body found in near a farm were he ""retired"" his last replicant. The film is definitely a detective story and plays like a traditional detective story that just happens to have a sci fi setting. You have your antagonist in Jared Leto who is unfortunately the weakest part of the movie. He is not giving a bad performance, but his performance is pretty much dry and doesn't set him apart from the traditional mustache twirling villain from any film that contains a clich√©d mustache twirling villain. The rest of the actors are phenomenal from Ryan to Harrison Ford and every actor on this list.Now for the more technical stuff. The film is shot very beautifully and it enriches the dystopic and decaying cityscape of Los Angeles that we came to love from the first movie. It has CGI that blends well with the environment which is good because sometimes CGI can call too much attention to itself and detract too much away from the movie itself, fortunately this is not the case as the CGI supports the film and it's story. It would be difficult to compare this film with the first one as the first film has set standards that not many films can live up to and luckily this one does and I'm very nit picky when it comes to comparing to the original. I highly recommend the film to those who wish to watch something that isn't another ""Avengers"" film or has the traditional feel of a classic Noir film with a big budget to support it. It's very rare to see these type of movies at the theaters now in days so please don't pass up this opportunity because of ""box office"" numbers."
318," Well - that was a disappointment
","How self-important can a movie be? For an answer watch Blade Runner 49. Ponderous direction, with endless close-ups of the main characters doing, well, nothing really. Clich√©d huge empty rooms with nothing other than designer baddie lair chic. Why would anyone sit alone in on a platform accessed by floating stairs for any other reason than being a world domination meanie? The self-regard was in total contrast to the original movie, that brimmed with ideas, and had many memorable scenes that were individually more exciting than the total time for this long boring sequel There were no big ideas either. Nothing to come close to replicating (see what I did there) the imagination of Phillip K Dick's original story. The science fiction was also out of date. The original was pre-Apple and Google and foretold of how the future might look. The 49 version appeared to have no awareness of the tech developments of the past 20 years. The design was also out of date, with the post Blade Runner Matrix having already presented that mix of future and past. The acting was rescued by the arrival of Harrison Ford, and he showed the younger cast members a few things about holding the centre stage. Ryan Gosling needs to find a few new expressions. All round very disappointed."
319," So much money, so long movie, so short story
","I was really disappointed by the so small density of the story.
I was expecting much more...
I almost fell asleep so the rythm of the movie is so sloooow.At the end of this movie, I had absolutely no clue about what happened or would happened next....Zimmer tries to respect Vangelis legacy, but only managed to keep us awake while the story was sinking into the sea.Compare to the prequel, all the image have more fog and smoke...
The bad guy is blind and lives in a stupidly esthetically yellow room with
a couple of sofas, in a middle of a swimming pool.The bad girl is just destroying the dreams of the good girl for sadic pleasure and it is the saddest part of the story.
Don't understand why they let K. alive when taking Deckard, as they wanted
absolutely not to let any track... ? What is the role of this real small wooden horse apart for losing the spectator into wrong tracks...I would like to see the scenarists which destroy a potential good subject into a poor story fired from the studios and replaced by more imaginatives persons.I give 2 stars, only for the nicely designed flying cars and the way they always nicely turn around before parking ;) reminding me of the cow-boys parking their nice stallions in front of each saloon in the western with John Wayne."
320," Blade Runner Review
","To start this off honestly, when I first viewed the Blade Runner I was bored to death. I as also in high school and didn't really appreciate quality cinema/sci-fi. As I entered my mid 20's I revisited Blade Runner and fell in love with its Neon Noir and dystopian look.Blade Runner 2049 was breathtaking. The cast, the sets, the dialogue, the effects, the lighting, the cinematography - all of these elements were so meticulously crafted. The sequel stayed loyal to its predecessor. Denis Villeneuve is able to maintain the look, feel & tone of the original and builds upon the Blade Runner's central theme: what does it mean to be human. As far as Sci-Fi movies go, I really love that they didn't go overboard on the expositions - especially for a sequel. The movie utilizes brevity so elegantly. Every scene, every word of exchanged dialogue has a purpose.Great movie, even better film."
321," Dull Clich√©
","Cinematography: Clich√©....for a moment i thought i sat in the sequel of Wong Kar Wai's 2046. Mono dimensional and simplistic, it lacks the tension of the first movies post apocalyptic tone and manner.Casting/characters: flat. If the lead character K is a 'good' robot, designed to be 'nice,' then 'out' are the terse dialogues between Deckard, Gaff and Bryant. The lack of quality support actors that carried the original (Batty, Tyrell, JF Sebastian), makes Deckart's 2049 dog look like a hero.Many irrelevant echos and references to the original movie. Borderline cheesy. I appreciate 'Atari' as pun...A real story line is absent. Nor does the story get anywhere close to being thought provoking: 'artificial lifeforms shouldn't replicate'...really?Music: Vangelis' synthesizer music was 'state of the art' in 1982. Hans Zimmer's music, by contrast is dull...and loud....Summary: I wanted to like this movie. But instead, i found it bad, boring, uninspiring. IMDb's score for the original movie is 8.2. In today's money that would be around 20. An 8.6 for the new version is, even in that context, too high."
322," How not to make a sequel: 101
","The original Blade-Runner was a masterpiece. Based on a cult science fiction novel (""Do androids dream of electrical sheep"" - by Philip K. Dick), it explored the theme of what does it mean to be human? It had an amazing film-noir like plot, rich with subtle details that don't cry for attention, elegantly crafted scenes, and possibly the best soundtrack in film history (originally composed by Vangelis) - a soundtrack so good you were not completely sure if it's a good movie with some background music, or good music with some background plot. As you were not completely sure about anything in that movie - who were the good guys and who were the bad guys? Who was more human - humans or replicants? Were Blade-Runners replicants or not? (""You know that Voight-Kampff test of yours? Did you ever take that test yourself?"") It was an implicit film, rich with symbolism, that always made you doubt and question.Its sequel might try to pick up the same story-line and ""universe"", but it completely fails to give any substance of its own. It doesn't make you wonder for a second. There are no doubts as to who are the good guys, and who are bad. The good are obviously good (despite the opening scene), and the bad are ridiculously bad. It is clear. There is no subtlety. It is painfully explicit. As one character put it (in an oh so Donald- Trump like way): ""I am the best"" - A line unnecessarily shouting the obvious (yet quite unconvincing) relations between her and the main character. While the original film plot was tightly driven by obvious clear necessity (replicants need to survive), I don't think there's even one scene in the sequel that could not be replaced by another - a mark of an aimless story-line, that is anything but elegant. The original Blade-Runner wasn't fast paced, it took it time, letting the story sink - but the sequel is just painfully and unnecessarily slow. The original movie had soul. It had a distinct and compelling atmosphere. It was crafted by artists with vision who fought to materialize that vision.Its sequel, despite being more shiny, is less than a replicant."

","The acting was amazing as always with these professionals, Harrison, Gosling and the crew. They were right on point! Loved it.But the story was long, drawn out and extremely boring at most times. I actually almost fell asleep a few times in the I-MAX theater.This did not live up to the hype. Although I did like the design of the Spinner Car. Other then that, I wanted my money back. Sad, I was so looking forward too seeing this film. Was saddened by the overall story line. In my ""Opinion"" do not waste your money on this title. It was lacking in plot and delivered nothing exciting at all except seeing the old characters back together once more."

","REVIEW - BLADE RUNNER 2049Finally the long awaited sequel finally arrived to rave reviews from all of the news papers. But..........Hinedtky, what a complete and utter waste of my time. I thought War For The Planet of the Ales was bad but this, I'd really rather watch paint dry. 2 hours and 42 minutes of a story which was written on the back of a postage stamp. I usually try to make these reviews interesting but I can't think of anything interesting to say about this film. Actually I can and I will. Hollywood we are not stupid, it doesn't matter what the original film was or turned out to be, please don't patronise us by making films like this obviously just for the money. Rating 3 out of 10"

0," Just kept waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting
","I love Tarantino. I was super excited to see this. The movie started. And then it went. And I waited for the plot. And then it came and went within the last 15 minutes of the film. Then I left confused and a little disappointed.The movie just felt like Tarantino wanted to show off how much he knows about film history and how nostalgic the old Hollywood made him feel. The acting was amazing. The cinematography was amazing. The storyline just wasn't there though. I want to say I loved it so bad but it just felt so flat to me.The characters didn't really develop at all. Leo's character just kind of changed halfway through with only a narration as to why he was different. Brad Pitts character was the exact same the entire film. Margot Robbie's characters development was that she finally said like 20 words at the very end.The ending was the most enjoyable part without a doubt. That felt like a classic Tarantino scene. The rest of it though just felt like a normal movie. The dialogue didn't feel like him to me for the most part, with the exception of a few scenes. The soundtrack was phenomenal and caught the vibe of the movie flawlessly.Maybe I was just hoping for more or maybe I missed out on something. It was an enjoyable movie, but it just felt off to me. I really hope he will make a final movie to end his career with a bang, because this is not the one"
1," Not for everyone
","The first 2 hours is only for lovers of everything late 60s retro,great cinematography and outstanding acting.The last 45 minutes fasten your seatbelts because classic Tarantino kicks in."
2," A movie that will be misunderstood
","Here's why not everyone will like this movie: it's not like all of Tarantino's other movies, and it's not like any modern movies either. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is a melancholy, slow burning, comedic love letter to an age of Hollywood that we find ourselves disconnect from nowadays.The point of this movie isn't to be just like Pulp Fiction and tell stories that have no meaning. In fact, I would argue that Tarantino wants each and every story to have a meaning. Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a faded action star struggling to hold onto his career and fame. Every scene he was in was enjoyable, as he internally argues with himself to be better than he is. He can't find work except for as a typecast villain, and turns down an offer to go overseas initially because he thinks it's too far a step down from his past career. Dalton's story was not as fun to me as his stunt double, Cliff Booth's (Brad Pitt), but I will get to that in a minute. Dalton's story, some will say, was boring, overdrawn, and pointless. I say it was the most important and interesting storyline in the movie. Rick is an alcoholic, and deals with a lot of anger towards himself, particularly in his trailer (you'll see what I mean), and the long scenes showing him act out his part as the villain in the western are extremely entertaining as DiCaprio does some brilliant work letting us see Dalton as an actor without losing touch with him by slipping into acting of his own. He finally decides to go overseas, but most of that time is spent in a montage. When he returns, he dons a new Italian wife and an entirely new fashion straight from Europe. He doesn't do much towards the end, except for burn a manson follower alive in his pool, and then he finally becomes friends with his neighbors. I'll also get to that when I talk about Sharon Tate. Rick is representative of Hollywood at the time of 1969, and unless you are familiar with film history, that will be lost on you. In 1969 movies like Easy Rider, Bonnie and Clyde, and The Graduate were changing the face of Cinema by eroding censorship codes and finally getting the studios to hand the reigns to directors, thus entering the age of auterism. Actors like Rick were becoming absolete in film for a number of reasons, but mainly that they hadn't had to search for work whilst under the studio system, they just signed a contract and found work immediately. Roman Polanski, his neighbor, was one of the directors that was now given a lot of free reign in this age, . Dalton's character expressed the frustration many probably felt at the time, and Tarantino built a character that was beautifully acted by DiCaprio.Cliff Booth on the other hand, was the most Tarantino character in the movie. I think he'll be the fan favorite, because he requires no historical context or empathy to understand. He's a stunt double who lives much worse than his star, Dalton, and is a no-no sense badass with a muddled past. His scenes were incredibly fun, as Pitt brought a certain energy to each scene that glued you to the screen waiting for his next move. Particularly at the end, when Tex had him at gunpoint and he was tripping on acid. Obviously he had the situation under control, but we as the audience have no idea until he sicks the dog on them. Booth was a character you expect to see in a Tarantino movie. None of his storyline was used for what people will say is ""pointless"", mainly because he is the most involved with the Manson clan.Interestingly, the Manson clan is hardly shown in the movie. Charles himself only shows up twice, and only says a few words. I actually like this choice, because it left a lingering thought that perhaps Manson was a danger at all times, and didn't play to the audience the way we thought it would. It wasn't a story about the Manson murders. Manson just happened to be going on at the time Dalton and Booth were having their struggles, and it intersected.Which brings me to my last point, and that is of Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie). Her role, while a tad less utilized than I expected, was Central because the real life Tate was murdered by the Manson clan. If you go in as an audience member with that knowledge, you go the whole movie waiting for something to happen to her, and it never does. Tate herself was a happy, blooming actress who spent time with friends and danced (a lot). This carefree manner was underlying a want to be famous, as she tells people who she is and is clearly disappointed when they don't recognize her. Tate plays a role in this story of showing the era of actors now replacing Rick Dalton, and also showing special to Hollywood, the silver screen's allure. As this is essentially a long love letter to Hollywood, Tarantino pens what drew him to the screen through Tate.With all of its references, obscure or in your face, there is a delicious amount to absorb, especially for cinefiles. Tarantino has the viewer to sit back, eat up the screen, and imagine we are right there with the characters in a wonderfully painted portrait of a Hollywood long gone. This movie will be misunderstood because of the expectations for the Manson murders, and because audiences nowadays expect action on every corner, which Tarantino's name can be attached to in some capacity. Without any crazy special effects to speak, simply a fantastic script and acting, I think many audience members will get bored or not understand why it's entertaining to others. I personally think it's one of Tarantino's best, if not his absolute best, and will stand the test of time for movie lovers everywhere. Agree or disagree, we all have to admit that Brad Pitt's dog was awesome."
3," A love letter to a film industry that is no longer recognisable.
","It took Quentin Tarantino a lifetime of living, 5 years to write and a 2 hours 41 minutes watch. This is a love letter to a film industry that is no longer recognisable. Hippies, short skirts, westerns..... all have disappeared from our movie world. But worry not, Quentin Tarantino is here to remind us of old school film making from a once beloved industry which has been described as being on life support.The performances are flawless. I was apprehensive about how the events of August 8, 1969 would be handled. But that is handled tastefully and respectfully, yet with the classic Tarantino flair.Will be quite a bit for those under 40 who have no recollection of this Hollywood. Some will categorise this as an over indulgent nostalgia trip for movie geeks. And they are likely to be correct. But for those of us who complain that Hollywood is reduced to remakes and comic book films, QT delivers a unique and creative viewing experience."
4," Pains me to write this
","I LOVE QT films and couldn't see this movie fast enough. All I can say is what was that all about? It was so boring. Did anyone edit this film? Leonardo's character was not likable. The only person tolerable was Brad Pitt. Nothing happened what so ever. The dialogue was not clever. The movie never went anywhere at all. It was just endless scenes of other movies being made. People driving in cars. Bare feet over kill. By the time the ending happened I didn't care anymore. I wanted to LOVE this movie, but I haven't been this bored in a long long time. I wish i felt differently."
5," The Emperor with No Clothes
","It reminds me of that old fable. People go to see Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio in a film by Tarantino and assume it has to be great despite what they are actually seeing on the screen.. The film is incredibly slow paced and neither funny nor suspenseful. Throwing in a 5 minute fantasy violent scene at the end after over two hours of boredom did NOT make me change my mind..
Sadly disappointing to this fan of most Tarantino films."
6," I'll keep it simple..
","If this script (if it could be said to be a script) had not been from Tarantino, it would have never reached theaters (and perhaps not even on cable television movies).Long, boring and pointless."
7," One of the Tarantino's worst (if not worst).
","Cinematography - great, acting - great. Music- reused already written works. Plot - none. Just almost 3+ hours worth of some random scenes stiched together without leading anywhere. Watched it twice. Has not changed my opinion. By the time it ended I did not care anymore, I just wanted to pee!!! After sitting there for almost 3 hours. What was the point of this movie? Still wondering.
One of the Tarantino's worst (if not worst!)."
8," Best Movie I Have Seen In At Least 10 Years, Should Be Seen Twice, BIG SPOILERS
","I have seen this film twice in the last two days, I probably will see it many more times.Tarantino has shocked and surprised me before, but this was the biggest shock of all. The movie is set in the Hollywood of 1969, just before the brutal Manson family murders.Leonard Dicaprio and Brad Pitt give career high performances. Dicaprio is Rick Dalton, a TV cowboy actor who longs for movie stardom but has now hit the skids. Pitt plays Cliff Booth his stunt double/driver and all around best bud. They also represent doubles of each other in real life, though Dalton is angry and frustrated at his failings in life while Booth is perfectly happy to be his pal's gopher and handyman. There is good recreations of TV westerns of the time, Dalton had been the star of ""Bounty Law"" a show that never existed but is clearly based on Steve McQueen's ""Wanted Dead Or Alive"" series. Dalton is now playing guest role villains on TV. An actual series ""Lancer"" is recreated here, I never saw this show when it aired since it was on up against ""The Mod Squad"" in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Dalton has some funny and touching scenes opposite a precocious 8 year old actress while doing the ""Lancer"" episode. The late Luke Perry has his final film appearance in these scenes also.Margot Robbie has an almost magical presence playing actress Sharon Tate. Tate unfortunately is best known today as the most famous of the Manson family murder victims. We see not only how beautiful she was but also how good and kind she was as well. One of my favorite scenes is when she goes to a movie theater to watch ""The Wrecking Crew"" a film she made in 1968 with Dean Martin. We see actual clips of the movie, (with the real Sharon Tate) and cuts back to her reactions, she becomes delighted when the audience laughs at her comedy bits and applauds at her fight scene with Nancy Kwan.The film starts to turn dark when Cliff picks up a teenage girl hitchhiker who wants to be taken to Spahn Ranch, a run down movie set where he once worked. I have read nearly everything about the Manson case, so I knew where it was going now. Cliff sees a bunch of mostly hippie girls hanging around and asks if George Spahn the original owner of the ranch still lives there. The scenes at the ranch are quietly disturbing. Dakota Fanning (I did not recognize her) plays Squeaky, one of the real life Manson girls. Her vacant eyes and cold manner make for some suspenseful moments. Cliff is concerned about his old friend George and demands to see him. He finds him now old and blind (Bruce Dern in a great cameo) but at least alive. Cliff is still suspicious but leaves the ranch.The final act comes up for the biggest shock of all. Rick has returned from several months filming some spaghetti westerns in Italy.He has also gotten married to an Italian actress. It is now August 8 1969. Cliff and his faithful pit bull Brandy are staying the night at Rick's house. Sharon Tate and some of her friends arrive at her home (which is right next door to Rick) to spend the evening together. Then Manson followers Charles ""Tex"" Watson, Patricia ""Katie"" Krenwinkel, Susan ""Sadie"" Atkins and Linda Kasabian are driving up the road. I knew what was coming and was dreading this moment, I was hoping that Tarantino would not show the gruesome murders but I was preparing myself.
Then Rick hears them driving up and has an angry altercation with them, then I was a bit surprised that real life characters were suddenly intermingling with fictional characters on a night when a horrible historic moment happened. When Rick goes into the house, the killers suddenly realize that he was the star of the TV show ""Bounty Law"". Then psycho Sadie goes on a rant about how TV showed her generation how to kill by showing murders every week on the small screen. I had heard some Manson followers had actually said this. Linda is too scared to go with the other three and takes the car keys and drives off leaving them. Another change in the real story, Linda did not participate in the murders but did stay with them, so once again I am getting bewildered. Tex, Sadie and Katie than decide to go to Rick's house rather than Sharon's. I am wondering are they now going to kill them also? Then the most surprising thing happens, Cliff, his pit bull and Rick decide to fight back against these scummy creeps leaving them to be battered and massacred. Brandy has some great scenes as one of the most heroic dogs I have seen in film. My head was reeling by this time, I kept thinking ""Are they really doing this?"" Then came the ending, Rick is now safe, Cliff injured but alive. And now Rick gets to meet his next door neighbor Sharon and her friends. I am still in shock but then for the first time we see the title on screen ""Once Upon A Time... In Hollywood"" and then I finally get it, this is a Hollywood story not real life, this is what we wish would have happened.I finally had to see the film again for a second time so I could actually enjoy that climatic scene, without the dread and confusion I had the first time.
This is a phenomenal work, like nothing I have ever seen and probably never will again."
9," No spoilers
",I can't spoil this movie because there's nothing to spoil!!! No plot. Nothing happens. If I submitted this same screenplay to Hollywood it would get rejected.
10," Flagrant Tarantino Fame Abuse
","If a no name writer came with such non-sense, their script would've hit the bin within the first ten pages. The script mocks every theory on character and plot development. Yet, the same gurus who would trash a rookie script writer for bringing anything less then perfect, are bowing now in humble awe to the great QT. This in not about double standards, but about Hollywood having no standards at all."
11," Was I even watching the same film?
","All this critical acclaim for this film (mainly because it's a Tarantino one) is so baffling. So what's wrong with it? For a start nothing actually happens throughout until the last 10 minutes. It's a slow, turgid, self congratulatory affair with drawn out scenes and tons of tips of the cap to the 'era' - through the soundtrack and product placement of 1960s packaging, or 'real life' characters like Sam Wannamaker's appearance - that just aren't needed. They even splice Di Caprio into the Great Escape as a 'what if?' moment...but all for what? Just Hollywood slapping itself on the back again about being Hollywood.There were genuine tense moments like when Pitt's character visits the Manson family allotment that turn into a damp squib. Again why was that scene so long? Why did they spend so much time on Di Caprio playing the baddy in the western but no time at all on his character's move to Italy (apart from the fact Tarantino wanted to imagine what 1960s spaghetti western posters would've looked like with DiC in them!). And what was the point of Al Pacino? Or Sharon Tate's character for that matter once you see the ending....?This was a missed opportunity that could've been a great piece on an actor's dwindling career that just turned into a boring series of sort of linked scenes...albeit quite well acted ones. Tarantino is become the new Woody Allen...actors want one of his films on their resume despite the fact he hasn't made a good one in so long"
12," Tarantino just created a new genre of film
","I don't typically leave IMDb reviews but this film deserves so much praise for its risky screenplay in such a dark true crime setting.For 2 hrs, 41 minutes, I was taken 50 years back, experiencing Hollywood's film industry as a comedic drama filled with desire, tension and everyday life.I liked Brad's character the most, but Leo easily matched with his own performance. A definite see-it-in-theatres watch. Bring your sense of humor though. There are lines of dialogue and laugh out loud bits that completely satisfy your curious mind. Expect everything you would from Tarantino, but also what you wouldn't.I gave it a perfect 10 because I forgot I was watching a nearly 3 hour film, even though it still wasn't long enough for me. I would like to see a director's cut up to an hour longer as I think this is a unique case that extra footage would only help such an already powerful story.I had the privilege to watch an early 70mm screening of this film at the cinerama dome with the director, Tarantino, in the audience. It was a surreal experience I'll never forget."
13," Oh so mediocre
","After all the hype around this film I was sorely disappointed. With an A List cast, as it had, it should have been Gold. The acting was terrific by Brad Pitt, Leonardo and Margot Robbie. The storyline sadly fell short, way short. The era was captured really well however I sat through the first hour thinking it was painting the scene and that the real action would start. I kept thinking that until the last 20 minutes when things finally came together, however, that was nearly 3 hours of film to sit through before any real appearance of the film I was expecting."
14," Love QT but Painful boring self-indulgence
","Even great actors can't save this storyless plotless meandering piece of self-indulgent nostalgia. It looks like they had a great time making it and to heck wirh the audience. I love the old-time movie feel of most of QTs films, but come on, you need a plot. You need to tell a story. As QT famously said a movie should make you want to sit down over a piece of pie afterwards and talk about it. Soon as our
group walked out all anyone had to say was how painfully boring and self-indulgent it was. That was it. QT you gave us nothing to talk about."
15," Self Indulgent Garbage
","Where to start? The end credits !Possibly the most boring, self indulgent rubbish I've ever seen. No plot to speak of, disjointed bits and pieces lumped together with no thought or consideration of any editing.I question how this ever got made, no one other than QT would have gotten away with this.Spoiler free review as nothing happens to spoil !!!"
16," This film will certainly divide audiences
","Another great Tarantino film, though I do agree there are times where it feels a little indulgent and meandering. The climax of the film is fantastic though, and it does make it feel like it was all worth it for the most part. There isn't really a defined narrative, which may put some people off but Tarantino's sublime dialogue and the great performances make all of the scenes at least entertaining. It's no Pulp Fiction, but it definitely is one of the most original films I've seen in a while."
17," Bruce Lee vs Brad Pitt
","Not one of Tarantino's best. But still a pretty damn good and smart movie with cool sequences, great acting and directing, music and scenes that will stay with you long after the movie and you would love to watch again.
Loved the combo Pitt-DiCaprio but loved more seeing some famous characters in this film such as Steve Mcqueen and Bruce Lee, who are absolutely hilarious in the movie!
8/10"
18," A love letter to all that is Hollywood
","Just got out of a screening. This movie was perfection to me! Everything plays a part in the experience. This is some of the best acting I have seen in a long time. I was swept away with the look, music, and story. The best part of this movie is when you are spending time with these characters. Rick Dalton has quickly become on of my favorite characters of all time! Leo lights the screen on fire every time we are with him. He is the ultimate package in this by giving Rick so much depth. Pitt does an amazing job as well. Cliff Booth would be a guy I would want to hang out with. It's nice to see a movie about two guy friends that support one another in different facets of life. It is so much deeper than some sort of average buddy cop affair. Margo Robbie gets a shout out too. She truly embodies Sharon Tate and glows on screen. She is amazing. This is Tarantino at the height of his powers. He gets the best performance out of everyone in every part of this movie. There are a lot of very enjoyable smaller parts in this. It's also great to see him working with the second generation of actors and actresses he has worked with in the past. I was taken on a ride to every part of Hollywood in this. From the glitz and glamour to the dark and twisted. This movie has a really awesome third act that I wouldn't dream of spoiling. I consider it a cherry on top of an already perfect movie. The directing, writing, music, cinematography, acting were all on point. It's a slow burn but all in all this movie is about Hollywood and the different aspects of it. The rising and falling of it's movie stars, and the people that flock to it in hopes of a different life. Go in with an open mind and let the movie take you on it's ride and you won't be disappointed."
19," Do not be fooled. This film is utterly pretentious garbage.
","Almost all artists reach a stage in their careers when their egos become greater than the quality of their work and this is the perfect example of that. Tarantino clearly believes that his genius is so great that he can serve up 3 hours of the dullest, most self-indulgent, rambling mess of a story and expect everybody to just accept it as a masterpiece. It's not even mildly entertaining like his more recent films have been.Anybody who thinks that they have seen genius in this film and that only the 'informed' movie connoisseur can understand what Tarantino is really trying to do here, is just a pretentious fool. This film is an insult to the viewer and evidence that Tarantino has truly lost the plot."
20," QT9 - a Hollywood fairy tale
","Greetings again from the darkness. Hippies, westerns, short skirts, pompadours, catchy pop songs ... all have (mostly) disappeared from our world. Back to save the day and the memories, and twist a little history, is Quentin Tarantino, the ultimate film geek. His latest reminds us of a bygone era of movie stars and old school filmmaking ... a once beloved industry which has been described as being on life support. There have been plenty of big screen love letters to Hollywood, but few if any, were filmed with so many personal touches and call-backs to the director's own films.In keeping with the request from Mr. Tarantino, this review will not include any spoilers or details that might negatively impact anyone's initial viewing of the film. It's a reasonable request since the film is so unique and literally packed with nostalgia, sight gags, and historical bits and pieces - some accurate, some not so much. There is a lot to take in and process, and the full impact of the initial viewing might result in awe, shock or disgust ... and maybe even all of the above. So this will be a pretty simple overview peppered with some insight that should enhance rather than spoil the experience.The film covers about 6 months in 1969, but in reality, it all takes place (at least what we see on screen) in 3 days. Leonardo DiCaprio (possibly his best ever performance) plays Rick Dalton, an actor who had a hit (fictional) TV western series in the 50's and 60's entitled ""Bounty Law"". Since the show ended, Rick has been unable to make the successful transition to movies. For comparison, think of Clint Eastwood, Steve McQueen and Burt Reynolds - all actors in TV westerns who found greater career success in movies. Brad Pitt (the epitome of cool) stars as Cliff Booth, Rick's stunt double, friend, driver, handyman, etc. While Rick is desperate to find the next stage of his career and fend off being forgotten, Cliff, a Vietnam vet, is accepting of his lot in life. Rick lives in a swanky Hollywood Hills home next door to hotshot director Roman Polanski and his starlet wife Sharon Tate; and Cliff lives in a trailer behind the Van Nuys Drive-In with his well-trained Rottweiler Brandy.There are multiple parallel stories to follow, and a key one involves the aforementioned Sharon Tate. Margot Robbie nails the role and bounces about town with the energy and sweet aura that we imagine she possessed. All 3 of the lead actors - DiCaprio, Pitt, Robbie - have knockout scenes that I'd love to be able to discuss, but I'm not sure how without giving away too much. What I can say is that each of these three talented actors prove that movie stars still exist.This is Tarantino's 9th film as a director (he counts the 2-part KILL BILL as one film), and he claims he will stop making films after number 10. There are multiple features we can count on in a QT film, and a ridiculously deep supporting cast is one. Going through each of the characters played by actors you will recognize would take a page and a half, so I'll cover only a few here. Margaret Qualley is a scene stealer as Pussycat, one of the Manson family girls. You likely remember her from the recent ""Fosse/Verdon"" or ""The Leftovers"", and here she fully embraces the hippie look and spirit. Emile Hirsch plays hairdresser Jay Sebring, one of those in the house with Ms. Tate on that fateful night, and Mike Moh plays Bruce Lee so convincingly that I was momentarily confused when he took off his sunglasses. Also making appearances are some Tarantino regulars: Kurt Russell (as a stunt coordinator and narrator), Michael Madsen (as an actor), and Bruce Dern as George Spahn (a late replacement after Burt Reynolds passed away). Others of note include Maya Hawke (Uma Thurman's daughter), Austin Butler (recently cast in the title role of Baz Luhrmann's Elvis biopic) as Tex Watson, Rumer Willis (Bruce's daughter) as actress Joanna Pettet, Damian Lewis as Steve McQueen, Al Pacino as agent Marvin Schwarzs, Dakota Fanning as Squeaky Fromme, and the late Luke Perry as actor Wayne Maunder (""Lancer""). 90 year old Clu Gulager (""The Virginian"", THE LAST PICTURE SHOW) makes an appearance, and Nicholas Hammond (Friedrich from THE SOUND OF MUSIC) tears into his role with gusto as director Sam Wanamaker. There is even a TV Guide cover featuring the late great character actor Andrew Duggan (""Lancer""). Some of these, and many more, are like cameos, but it's still fascinating to see the faces.1969 was 50 years ago, and Tarantino does a remarkable job of recreating the look of Sunset Boulevard, Hollywood Boulevard, Cielo Drive, and studio backlots. Much credit goes to Production Designer Barbara Ling and Set Decorator Nancy Haigh (frequent Coen Brothers collaborator and an Oscar winner for BUGSY). Arianne Phillips does a tremendous job with the costumes that look natural for the time period, and not like something right off the wardrobe racks. Three-time Oscar winning Cinematographer Robert Richardson (HUGO, THE AVIATOR, JFK) is back for his 6th Tarantino film, and he captures the look and feel and vibe of a time that is so personal to the director.It's been three and a half years since THE HATEFUL EIGHT, Tarantino's most recent film, and probably his worst received. This one is clearly personal as it captures the time and place that he fell in love with movies. The dichotomy of rising starlet and fading cowboy as neighbors is a brilliant way to make a point about times changing. This was a time of transition in the United States - a new culture was upon us, and whatever innocence remained, was surely snuffed out on a hot August night in 1969. As usual, his use of music serves a purpose. We are treated to Roy Head, The Royal Guardsmen, and Paul Revere and the Raiders, among others. QT also shows us plenty of bare feet (another trademark). What is unusual is that the film lacks the trademark mass dialogue. This one kind of meanders ... right up until it doesn't.Quentin Tarantino is a living, breathing film geek (that's a compliment) who has earned the right to make the movies he wants to make. This one took him a lifetime to live, 5 years to write, and it will take you 161 minutes to watch. It was warmly received at Cannes, but no one can expect to ""catch"" everything Mr. Tarantino has served up in one viewing. That said, one viewing will likely be one too many for quite a few folks (especially many under 40 who have no recollection of this Hollywood). Some will categorize this as an overindulgent nostalgia trip for movie nerds. And they are likely correct. But for those of us who complain that too many movies are remakes, re-treads and comic books, there is no denying Tarantino delivers a unique and creative viewing experience - and it's not meant for everyone."
21," Amazing Retro Movie
","Rating 9.5/10
This movie takes back you to late 60s retro. Wonderful cinematograpy and storyline to give new experience from different era's to audience. Superb acting performance to all the characters expecially Leonardo diCaprio a.k.a Rick Dalton and Brad Pitt a.k.a Cliff Booth. I was really amazed by the acting of Leo, he deserves the oscar for this role. Worth to watch."
22," A movie without story or any sense
","It was excruciating to sit there was 2.5 hours and watch this movie. The movie segments don't mean anything or connect to a central story. There are times you will ask yourself what was the point of the last half an hour of the movie, does it mean anything.
If you have an enemy then please recommend this movie to him."
23," Can be a very important film in Cinema history
","Good film, but only those who have a lot a knowledge in Hollywood and Cinema history are going to really appreciate some things in the movie and now that we are entering in a new decade in cinema with all those streaming services and comic books movies, Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood can really be a very important film."
24," Don't get too excited over this movie.
","I am a big fan of Tarantino films. I was also excited to see the chemistry between 2 big Hollywood stars in Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt.
This was nothing like what you would expect from a Tarantino film. The only likeable character in this 2.5 hour snooze fest, was Cliff, played by Brad Pitt.In the 2.5 hours of plotless movie, I got up out of my seat twice, I was that bored.It also just ended. On nothing. For a moment, I had actually wondered why the cinema lights came back on."
25," Feels like 1969!
",Great characters showcasing what might have been! Only if...
26," Much ado about nothing.
","DiCaprio and Pitt collaborate with Tarantino once again for the directors ninth (and supposedly penultimate) feature film as writer/director. Set in 1969 Hollywood, the film follows fading actor Rick Dalton (DiCaprio) and his loyal stunt double Cliff Booth (Pitt) as they navigate their way through the absurdities of Hollywood life. Inbetween their exploits we follow Sharon Tate (Robbie), who gleefully indulges in all the fun and glamour that Tinseltown has to offer. I'm a big Tarantino fan, so naturally my expectations for Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood were high. What a shame it is then to report his ninth feature is an uneven, average affair that doesn't live up to the brilliance of his previous efforts.Both DiCaprio and Pitt make for a great pairing, and they both carry the film even throughout its most sluggish moments. Margot Robbie is sadly wasted in the film as Tarantino gives her practically nothing of worth to work with, resulting in what feels more like an over glorified cameo as opposed to a legitimate role worth playing. Narratively speaking, the film is uneven and at times tedious to sit through. Tarantino is known for his engaging storylines, intriguing characters and sharp dialogue, but none of that is to be found here. Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood doesn't really have a cohesive storyline, emphasized largely by the elimination of chapter breakdowns, a storytelling technique Tarantino is widely known for. At its core, it's a celebration of Hollywood moviemaking during the sixties and an exploration into the relationships between actors and their stunt doubles. While there are a handful of noteworthy scenes to be found here, they aren't enough to save the film from being a pretty average affair. Technically speaking the film is very well made and contains great shot composition along with a solid soundtrack. Unfortunately, there just aren't many ideas on display worthy of hanging a feature film on, making for a disappointing outing from one of the modern masters of cinema. If this is indeed Tarantino's penultimate effort, hopefully his swansong will return to the quality of his previous works."
27," Either the Worst or the Best Film...
","Before watching this film, it is CRITICAL that you have somewhat of a knowledge about Charles Manson (and Sharron Tate). If I did not have my sister next to me pointing out the small references to this serial killer's story, I would not have understood at least 80% of the movie. Understanding the significant details adds a specific intensity in every other scene, like you know something that the characters don't, and always keeps your eyes glued to the screen.Although I can see how a few scenes were fairly slow, and the middle was not particularly engaging, Tarantino definitely had a purpose for each scene, even if I don't have all the answers. Even the smallest of details, like a gun holster of beer or the way the characters drive down the highway, reveals hidden thoughts, feelings, and backstories to the audience. If you do not catch onto these specific details, I can understand how some points seem overindulgent of ""the golden age"" of Hollywood. But the beautifully nostalgic filming in these moments is what makes this film not only entertaining, but a piece of art.It's the juxtaposition of Sharron and Dalton's storyline, it's the wonder and the dimensional characters, it's the brilliant manipulation of the audience's emotions, causing you to laugh, scream, and cry (sometimes simultaneously) that makes this film utterly perfect.The ending leaves you wondering ""What if..."" over and over again, questioning what reality would look like if these fictional characters of Rick Dalton and Cliff Booth actually existed. And I think that's when I realized how perfect the title was: it's a humorous, fairy-tale (although not completely violent-free) ending to the tragic fate of Hollywood in the 60s..."
28," The Most Mature and Intelligent Tarantino Film To Date
","I just got in from watching Once Upon a Time In Hollywood. I've been a Quentin Tarantino fan since, well, Reservoir Dogs. Amid his trademark over-the-top violence and gore, I have always felt he treats the art with a respect that's often lost in controversy. His execution of heartfelt homage is so authentic that it becomes his biggest criticism, and to the less astute, is often dismissed as blatant theft.Once Upon a Time In Hollywood is the homage of all homages. Critics are calling this Tarantino's ""love letter to Hollywood"", but in reality it's much, much more. This letter addresses a Hollywood that's no longer recognizable, and that melancholy is woven into the fabric of this film. While there is the requisite violence, witty banter, and unpredictable outcomes, this is probably the most mature and intelligent Quentin Tarantino film yet. It also deviates from the Tarantino template by remaining somewhat linear. With a runtime of just over two hours and forty minutes, the pacing is artfully throttled, allowing the audience to take in the authentic and painstakingly detailed scenery. The period music drives the narrative but never becomes a music video. The performances are flawless. Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt will deservedly receive accolades for their performances as the main characters, but honestly there is not a single weak performance among the ensemble. And lastly, the subject matter: I was admittedly apprehensive about how the events of August 8, 1969 would be handled. While no one would be surprised to see these heinous acts glorified or even caricatured, Tarantino continues to be unpredictable. At the risk of spoiling the plotline, I'll just say this is handled tastefully and even respectfully, yet true to the classic Tarantino flair.Once Upon a Time in Hollywood demonstrates a more mellowed Quentin Tarantino touch but it's far from a departure. I suspect audiences that normally can't stomach the assaulting violence and shock of the Tarantino brand may very well enjoy this film."
29," Overhyped and underwhelming - and I usually love Tarrantino Filems
","While I generally love Tarantino films, ""Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood"" left me cold. I was expecting something great. Instead he gives us a bit of a mess filled with forced 1960s references, really forced, unlike ""American Graffiti"" which just melded them into the fabric of the film. Even the afterscene was forced and certainly not worth waiting for.Yes the acting was generally pretty darned good. Yes, the camera work was dazzling. But the film just seemed superficial and artificial.I realize there are plenty of folks who just adored the film and concluded it was innovative and clever beyond belief. I fear those conclusions are as superficial as this film.So if you're a fan of Tarrantino films, this could go either way for you. If you don't buy into the hype, you very well may enjoy it. But iIf you're not a fan of his films, this one isn't likely to turn you into a fan. Better you should rent ""Reservoir Dogs."""
30," A Tarantino Film is like a Hanzo sword. It can only be compared to other Hanzo swords.
","Tarantino at his best, in rare form. Dicaprio and Pitt acted their faces off. Its funny smart and original in a world of remakes and comic book films. A true new Masterpiece."
31," Once....is a fairy tale. With a fairy tale ending.
","To those who hated the ending I can only say that when the scene ended I leaned to my wife and said..if only that's really what happened.
If only...
If only life were a fairy tale where the wolf doesn't eat the pigs."
32," Enjoyable but you need to understand the back story.
","Some will say that this is an over long film that lacks a plot, and without some knowledge of the Tate-LaBianca murders I can see why that may be the case.But, if you understand the backdrop you will realise Tarantino brilliantly uses the first 2 hours of the movie to lay the foundations to a big question - what if Tex Watson, Susan Atkins, and Patricia Krenwinkel (the 3 who committed the murders in real life) went to the wrong house?What if they stumbled across characters like Rick (DeCaprio) and Cliff (Pitt) on that fateful night instead?The answer is a compelling, funny and moving last 30 minutes of the film.The cinematography and acting is also top class."
33," This film had a significant impact on me
","I have always had an interest in crime. I read the book about the Ice Man (contract killer.)I watched numerous documentaries and films ranging from Jack the Ripper docs to Monster (Wuonos.) I watched many episodes of the show ""Most Evil"" where an expert assigns serial killer an ""evil rating"" based on a specific set of criteria. I'm sure at some point he analyzed Manson. I've seen many episodes of Criminal Minds and all the episodes of Mind Hunter. I guess you could say I had a morbid curiosity. I always felt safe and secure as though there was a protective shield between me and the content I was watching.Then my mom recommended we watch ""Once Upon A Time in Hollywood."" Now I'm an (early) 90s baby but I love the 60s. Both of my parents are boomers. I certainly knew about Charles Manson and what he had done.I watched the film with a mild sense of dread because I honestly thought it was going to show the brutal killings of Tate and the other victims-Voytek Frykowski, Steven Parent, Jay Sebring, Abigail Folger, Rosemary and Leno LaBianca. To be clear this is not a full list of all the Manson victims but just the most famous ones who were murdered on the nights of August 8-9th 1969. I assumed that was to be the climactic end to the film. I just couldn't bear to see it. Tarantino movies are so long; the longer I watched the more I became absorbed and attached to the victims. Everything inside of me was consumed with dread. I felt so very attached to Tate in particular. Perhaps because of Tate's quintessential vulnerable nature- a petite beautiful soft spoken actress 8 and a half months pregnant.This film left me shaken to my core because of what my imagination did. I desperately wanted to believe that Tarantino's version is how it really played out but we all know that's a fairy tale. I imagined what really happened to those poor innocent souls on those nights and my heart shattered. I could not sleep that night nor the night after that.Tarantino, like he always does, made it feel very real. He made it so easy to empathize with the victims. The protective shield of the screen between me and the content had been viciously pierced. Tarantino played a dirty trick; as we all know our imagination is infinitely worse than reality except perhaps in the rare case of this very example. I'm so glad Tarantino took the classy route. Nonetheless, I have imagined what actually happened over and over again.We have become so immune to violence in today's culture from seeing our hyper violent material in our tv and movies (here's looking at you Tarantino.) And yet it was a Tarantino film that actually made me realize that the fascination surrounding crime and violence should not be merely observed as entertainment or morbid curiosity. It should be felt. You should be shaken to your very core. You shouldn't be able to sleep at night. You should feel violently repulsed and overcome with sadness. Innocent people died in the most brutal and heinous way possible at the hands of young drugged out psychopaths with nothing to live for but a madman's approval and a free place to live. Sharon Tate was the final one to die. She had to listen to her friends get stabbed to death before the killers finally on her while listening to her pleas to spare her only for the sake of her unborn son.It's such a crying shame, the killers weren't put to death. Young children know basic morality. Teenagers certainly do as well. Sure, some of them do foolish things like partake in drugs and dive head first into shallow pools. But they certainly know not to commit pre-meditated murder stabbing each victim no less than 20 odd times. In addition, they violated the dead; using their blood to smear filthy degrading words. In the case of the LaBianca murders they left the steak knife jutting out of the mans throat and pierced a fork into his stomach before they left. These people are real life monsters- the boogeymen and women. Please, we need to stop any sort of glorification of crime and criminals because this is exactly what they seek and desire.I hope this film urges everyone to sign the petitions to keep Tex Watson, Patricia Krenwinkle, Bobby Beausoleil, Bruce Davis and Lesley Van Houten behind bars because they were unfortunately given life with the chance of parole. Remember these are the same people who stabbed their victims repeatedly later bragging about it to cellmates. Prison is heaven compared to the punishment they truly deserve which probably shouldn't even be attempted to be achieved by us mere mortals anyway but at the very least they should never be let out for their sheer destruction and total lack of regard they had for human life. They will never be ""rehabilitated."" Sure, they may be on their best behavior in prison and they may have ""found God"" now but I wonder where God was for Tex in between the moments when he was stabbing the life out of the 7 victims he mercilessly killed. I don't buy it for one minute. Every single one of the killers are almost as manipulative, duplicitous and cunning as Manson himself. I am so appalled.Sharon Tate's mother Doris Tate went on to become a champions of crime victims. Now the responsibility is squarely placed on the only surviving member of Sharon's immediate family- Debra who has gone to every single parole hearing of all of the Manson killers. Please for all the victims, for all the victims families, for Doris and for Debra please sign the petitions."
34," Once Upon a Time in Hollywood
","I really can't say anything that i didnt like about this movie.
It is definitely a masterpiece! DiCaprio and Pitt were amazing in the film."
35," The more you appreciate cinema as an art, the more you will like this film
","I would like to preface this review by expressing that I didn't particularly love this film as much as I expected to. Like many others, Tarantino is one of my favorite directors. I respect his fundamental consistency and his creative license above all else, and he lets both of those aspects shine through brightly in his 9th undertaking. It was this particular flavor of storytelling that he used this time around that I wasn't fond of. There was nothing difficult to follow about it, but it just didn't want to piece itself together into any coherent arcs. I can certainly appreciate that this was the feel Tarantino was going for, but it was not one I could appreciate during my viewing. With that being said, the story wraps up into a bizarre, unique, and satisfying conclusion that reminded me why I will always be in theaters for this director. What makes Tarantino so great is that he maintains such sound film fundamentals when taking on these strange and creative projects. His actors blew their roles out of the water, his cinematographer enhanced their potent performances further, and his set/costume decorators crafted a world of immersion. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is not a film everyone will love, but it is a film everyone should see."
36," Slept for 15 min and Missed Nothing
","Big fan of many Tarantino flicks. Pulp Fiction is one of my all time favorites. This? Waste of cash.No story, no plot, and hardly any dialogue for Sharon Tate. Hated the Bruce Lee scene and felt it was so disrespectful. Manson seen for 30 seconds. All Manson Family scenes total up to about 30-45 minutes and some of it could have been cut. I'm talking to you Bruce Dern scene. While Dern was great that whole thing could have been trimmed down to 5 min easily.The movie should have been reduced to 90 minutes. Even then it would have sucked because there is no tie in with the characters really. Sure the acting was good, but so what? I'd rather see a story line. And feel free to deliver it out of order Mr. Tarantino.... but I didn't care about any of the characters at all.The last 15 minutes is the only reason to even watch the flick. And it is amusing and cute, even touching in a way because Sharon lives. But the other two hours and 25 minutes were a complete waste of time, energy, a waste of good acting, and a waste of the paper Tarantino wrote it on."
37," What are these people smoking?
",Yes Leo and Brad give great performances but it feels like a long drive where the kids keep asking : are we there yet? And please do not ever mention Pulp fiction and this movie in the same breath as being his best work ever. Tarantino should've kept this one to himself to flatter his ego but i expected so much more.
38," It will help put you to sleep
","I can't believe all the high reviews for this film. While the acting was fine, there is no plot.. When you go see a QT film you expect great dialog, interesting characters and a craziness that only QT provides. This didn't have any of it. It seems liberal Hollywood has cut the balls of QT. This was as boring and dull as you can get. By the time the ending comes, and you get maybe 5 minutes of classic QT it doesn't matter anymore. Very disappointed."
39," People are afraid to say the truth about this film
","People will say it's a great, fantastic, masterpiece film from Tarantino, but truth be told it's just simply terrible and boring with pointless scenes scattered throughout.If I'm wrong, this film will sell millions of blue-rays so people can watch it over and over again and still be highly rated in years to come..........but I doubt it after the dust settles"
40," A meandering masterpiece ... I didn't want it to end
","This is such an unusual movie. It doesn't really have a plot ... it's kind of like a ""day in the life of a fading Hollywood TV actor"", but still it's just fascinating to watch. The acting, cinematography and production values for capturing the late 60s (and really ... dawn of the 70s) are about as good as you'll ever see. It's just art.And when it comes the ending ... wow. Especially if you know a bit of history. It's intense and amazing and I'll just leave it at that.That said, it is a little male-biased by modern standards, but it's capturing the mentality of a different time period. DiCaprio and Pitt play two wildly different characters that you just want to keep watching to see they do next. They will quite possibly win Oscars for their performances -- and Tarantino will no doubt be up for best director, best original screenplay and best film.If you enjoy Tarantino's moviemaking style - the dialog, the visuals, the period details and, yes ... the violence ... this is a must see. It's almost 2 and 3/4 hours - but I would have gladly stayed longer.BTW, if you stay a minute into the end-credits, there's a post credit scene followed by a fun radio (audio-only) contest commercial."
41," Possibly the best Tarantino so far
","The script is perfect. It cleverly uses the unpleasant threat of the Manson family, the overall strange and mystic feeling of L.A. living in their cars, and the three main characters: one describing the fear and anxiety we all have, one presenting the idealized and brave masculinity we wish to have, and one presenting the love for the art and the beauty of old Hollywood.LDC, Brad Pitt and Margot Robbie all do a wonderful job, but Brad Pitt's performance is perfect. There are few scenes that are visually so perfect and intense that you will remember them for years.I went to the cinema with my teenage children and their friends. Some of them were totally confused and bored, and I cannot blame them: the movie is complex, clever and based on the knowledge of Hollywood history, that it was totally beyond their understanding.Most reviews explain that the main theme of the film is friendship which naturally is true. The deeper theme is the love for the film as an art form and the anxious pain of artists seeking acceptance. The film shows this in a visually amazing way, with a perfect rhythm and a perfect cast.For me, this was pure art. It answered questions that I did not know I had until the movie answered them. And one additional note; this is a perfect movie to explain the concept of Chekhov's gun for those young movie goers who were not familiar with the concept before.The film community has warmly accepted Tarantino which is presented in a beautiful way in the end."
42," One of the best movies ever made.
",People who rate this a 1 have no clue. Be relaxed and go see this movie on a good 4k hdr tv with good sound. Just sit back and enjoy the genius of the movie.
43," Mediocre
",There is a fine line between artful pulp and gimmick and unfortunately this was too much on the side of gimmick. On top of that it was overlong and never really got off the ground despite having plenty of time to do so. Average.
44," awful
","I honestly don't know what everyone is raving about. Sure there were a couple of funny parts at the end... after a loooong 2.5 hrs of nothing. They made it look just like it did in 1969, but really who cares? Watch a movie filmed back then if you want nostalgia and it will actually be good. The acting was well done, but the story sucked so bad that the acting didn't matter. I usually love Quentin Tarantino movies but this was absolutely awful."
45," Tarantino has lost his touch - not just as a filmmaker
","This movie has you sit and wait for something to actually happen for more than 2 hours. The end is kind of satisfying, i have to give you that. But it cannot make up for more than 2 hours of boredom and tarantino's attempt to drag Bruce Lee's reputation through the dirt.What bugs me the most is just that, the portrayal of Bruce Lee. Some - even the actor that portrays Lee - justify this scene by saying that tarantino wanted to humanize lee. But that's a huge load of BS... humanize Lee to super-humanize brad pitt's character?
Sorry, that just doesn't make sense.I have been a tarantino fan since reservoir dogs and did even forgive his weaker movies. But after seeing once upon a time i can say: tarantino has lost his touch. Not only as a filmmaker.1. The first 2 hours are painfully boring. Plot-wise literally nothing happens. 2. There was no need to (try to) kill an asian-american icon's legacy. There would have been many possible ways to achieve what tarantino was aiming at. But not only did he pollute Lee's reputation, but also did he do it in the worst way possible - by ridiculing him, as hollywood has done for many, many years and decades with asian actors/roles.So from now on i will no longer be paying a single more dime to watch any tarantino movie.And to anyone involved in this movie and who has approved the aforementioned scenes, i can only say: shame on you!"
46," What a load of nothing
","Unbelievably boring and mundane movie apart from last 10 minutes. Me and the missus are huge QT fans but this and the Hateful 8 were just slow burn self indulgent ego rubs. Given the budget and the cast my 12 year Old niece could have made a better film!
But I bet they all had a jolly old time making it...
4 stars for the 60s vibe and that's the best I can say."
47," Exhausting...
",Sitting through a film (I'm English) for that amount of time for 10 minutes action that has a tenuous link to a non existent plot was hard work.How has this got a review rating of 8.0 when the overall consensus is its a pile of do do is beyond me!
48," Very refreshing if you're tired of generic movie formulas
","This is the first Tarantino film I've seen since I'm not so good with violence, and I was pleasantly surprised to find that this movie blew my expectations out of the water. In my opinion, it was well-shot, with great acting, and kept you wondering what's going on. As a viewer, I had no idea what direction the story was going in, and that, for me, was really refreshing. It felt like seeing an interesting snippet (albeit a long snippet) of a longer story. Personally, I'm sick of predictable same-formula movies, and I loved that I just didn't know what was coming, so I enjoyed every little bit for what it was."
49," Not Tarantino' Best Work
","I had high hopes for this movie but the plot was loose and relaxed. The movie was filled to the brim with uneventful filler and violence felt misplaced. That's all I can say that's bad about it. The acting was great, the dialogue was great, the cinematography was excellent. Leonardo DiCaprio was amazing, Brad Pitt was funny and Margot Robbie was charming as usual. Its worth the watch but don't expect too much."
50," What if..?
","Well this movie is a far more interesting story than just a homage to the Hollywood of the late 60s
This Is Quentin's 'what if' question...
What if although US had done their job pretty well to help the humanity to defeat the German Nazis ('14 fists of Mccluskey' - flamethrower scene), it did missed the totalitarian dangerous virus within itself (the pool flamethrower scene is kind of a dream of fixing this).
So What if Sharon Tate... what if America had survived the year 1969?"
51," Tarantino on top form
","""Once Upon a Time"" is first class Tarantino. DiCaprio and Pitt are brilliant as fading actor and stuntman friends Rick Dalton and Cliff Booth.Behind the gloss of Hollywood, there's an air of suspense and tension as the calendar and clock countdown to one infamous fateful night.Rich in atmosphere, beautifully written and shot, this is essential viewing.10 out of 10."
52," Unique experience.
","Never expected such a feel good movie from Tarantino.
DiCaprio and Pitt indeed performed their best.
Climax was high octane. Brandy the dog, was such a darling.
10/10"
53," Excellent movie!
","I loved it for a few reasons:
1. I am a Tarantino fan,
2. I am a Brad Pitt fan, and...
3. I am a DiCaprio fan...With that being said, my 16 year son thought it was a great movie too.
I grew up in CA, so I love this historical epriod movies, great locations, great visuals. 2 hours, 41 mons...flew by!The ending was very graphic, but worth the wait. (Tarantino fashion)
Will buy this movie, when available."
54," Tarantino does it again!
",Another superb masterpiece by Quentin Tarantino with his ninth movie! Watching this I could not help but remember Forest Gump. Both movies are a mixture of history mixed with fiction creating an alternative history.. Great performances by DiCaprio and Pitt and the wonderful gorgeous Robbie. Tarantino knocked it out of the park with this one! p.s. obviously this movie is not for those who can hardly speak English let alone understand the language! (hint hint at one particular review).
55," Superb!
",A wonderfully scripted movie with superb acting. I was engrossed throughout. Treat yourself and give it a watch. A masterpiece in my opinion.
56," Whenever your passion for cinema gets low, watch a Tarantino's movie and you're back on track.
","(Once Upon A Time In Hollywood - The organized mess)
This is the Tarantioniest movie I've seen since Kill Bill, although Django Unchained and Inglorious B*stards are considered two of the greats or
modern classics as I'd like to call, they're not Tarantinoed as this one.
Tarantino is a genius, and most of the cinephiles can't argue with that. Putting that in mind while watching OUATIH drives you to always find a single tiny
specific detail that is hidden here or there that supports maybe the movie cause, the cinematic era or even Tarantino's world and it's always perfectly
organized with the others flow despite scattering them all around the scenes.
(The symbolism - '60s '70s)
Rick Dalton is an actor at the edge of his career. He is becoming neglected in Hollywood and his tomato is now rotten.
Rick represents an entire era of TV actors during the '50s and the '60s, they had the talent they could do it but how they handled it made them
decay year after year. You'll notice the conversation between Rick and the young girl in the location how he sees it and how she sees it, a huge difference
in point of views.
Sharon Tate represents the new era of acting, how it's gonna be in the '70s. You can see that both of them are neighbors but they haven't even say
hello to each other once, this is the barrier, the barrier between the '60s and '70s in the Hollywood cinema, very small, massive difference.
The incident that is supposedly was the full stop to the '60s was Sharon Tate death by the Manson family. But, what if there was a little modification in
history, what if the Manson family were killed before their act by this expired actor, what if the '60s actor then met with the '70s future providing unseen
combination, maybe the history of cinema would differ, it could've been better, could've been worse.
Fairy tale, isn't it? but don't worry, it won't happen, it is just Once Upon A Time In Hollywood."
57," Incredibly good
","You need the typical Tarantino vibe to enjoy this movie at it's best, it's so refreshing to see this movie."
58," Blissful
","Immerse yourself in 1969, kick back, and enjoy the scenery, because the attention to detail is mind-bogglingly brilliant.
Don't take it too seriously, but watch carefully, because every scene has been artfully crafted. As with almost all Quentin Tarantino films, the actors appear to be having a ball and, consequently, turn in witty, profound and enviable performances. I found myself urging it to go back to the start just so I could bask in its beauty all over again, and again and again. So much to enjoy here, all powered by Tarantino's glorious mischief. Keep an open mind, don't stress about comparing it to anything else, and revel in every moment. I did.
And when it's all over, download or buy the soundtrack. You won't regret it."
59," Classic Tarantino!
","You should know about the Manson Murders and the way Sharon Tate was murdered to get this.
I just loved it. Pay attention on the details. I loved it and Tarantino has never let me down."
60," Perfection
",Every single time after i watch the latest Tarantino movie my first thought is it can't get any better than this... and i'm always wrong. This man is a genius.
61," A Different Masterpiece by Tarantino
",This movie captures a lesser known side of Tarantino.
62," Best movie of 2019
",An homage to the golden age of cinema and simply one of the best Tarantino films to date
63," Waste of time...
","This is one of those films that I just really cannot understand the high ratings. It's not just a 'that's not for me' film.There is almost 2 hours of fairly slow, uninteresting 'early Hollywood' acting that seems to have little relevance to the ending. The ending is exciting but I left the cinema going 'what on earth was that all about' - in a bad way.There are the usual Tarantino querks - but not pay off, no wow factor and no longing to buy the dvd or watch again when it leaves the cinema."
64," Hollywood Fiction
","This is a film in which Tarantino combined two other films: Inglourious Basterds and Pulp Fiction. The whole movie is watching very fast. From the views of Hollywood of the late 60s is fascinating. I think this is one of the best Tarantino films, but not the best."
65," Go see it... Twice.
","QT delivers big league. Forget the disappointing Hateful Eight. His classic vignette-style moviemaking is in full effect though presented differently than most of his previous work. The dialogue we love is there but is not so conscious of itself as usual. QT serves up some subversively sexy shots of Pitt and Robbie, just a little cherry on top for his audience.Thanks QT for gifting us a movie starring Pitt and DiCaprio. Reality and fiction blur in more ways than one. The QT universe hums quietly in the background ready to dish out more Easter eggs at every turn.One critic said this movie is like a time machine. I agree. It's an immersive experience. The characters have heart. I learned to love Rick Dalton as his story unfolds. Pitt's stuntman Cliff Booth is the real star, his story is where real life is taking place.Every performance is beyond satisfactory. The soundtrack is a dream. The color saturation and cinematography is all you'd expect from QT and then some. I wanted to see this film again immediately and plan to today."
66," I think I have a new favorite Tarantino movie
","As someone who likes but has never really loved Tarantino's style, I was blown away by this movie. It's more than a nostalgic trip back to 1960s Hollywood; it's a weird statement on movies and escapism themselves. It is every bit the fairy tale the title ONCE UPON A TIME... IN HOLLYWOOD implies, with its second chances and bizarre happy ending, though even these are tempered with little reminders of painful realities.Those looking for hard plot will be disappointed. This is a very laid back movie, just following the daily lives of a handful of characters in 1969 LA. Cinephiles and those fond of the 1960s will likely get the most out of it-- if you walk in not having some familiarity with the Tate murders or the Manson family, you might get a bit lost.The lack of plot hardly matters, as the characters are fun to watch. Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt are both hilarious and touching in their roles. Margot Robbie was a fabulous Sharon Tate and I'm honestly a bit bummed her role wasn't larger. That scene with her in the movie theater was just classic.The long run-time initially daunted me-- part of my problem with so many mainstream Hollywood movies these days is that they're often too long (especially superhero movies), but the three hours here flew right by. I was enjoying myself so much that I was loathe to leave these characters once the credits rolled at last."
67," Excellent movie
","There is no doubt that this film will be a great Oscar candidate, Quentin Tarantino made what for me, is his best film. It has one of the best casts of the cinema, all of great importance, and highlighted the main Leonardo DiCaprio, Margot Robbie and Brad Pitt who shine in one of their best performances of their careers. A film that honors Hollywood and has visually spectacular scenes. From his great initial scene to that grand finale, I got hooked and highlighted his last 20 minutes that are one of the best and the most exciting. I really liked their post-credit scene and the song they used. One of the movies that will become a cult movie."
68," Longer than it needed to be (and not in a good way)
","This is a tricky one. The acting is superb trhoughout. DiCaprio does himself proud, as does Pitt. It's shot well, it's incredibly nostalgic, but I can't help feel it's missing something. The last 30 mins are ace - that's where the positive reviews are kept. Tarintino does what he does best in that last half hour. It's a shame it took two hours to get there. More time developing the final storyline and less nostalgia would probably have led to a better experience. Or tell the same story in 90 minutes. The soundtrack was ace - pure sixties.All in all, go see it, but go for a wee first.Plot 3/10
Acting 9/10
Ending 7/10
Duration vs interest 3/10
Soundtrack 7/10Overall 6/10"
69," At least the dog had some fun
","Tarantino proofs once more to be one of the most overrated directors of our time, here we have a waisted cast of actors : Pitt boring himself to tears, DiCaprio painfully overacting, ( at least funny sometimes). And Margot Robbie just being blond, watching her own movies, anything else? Ah, yes, Al Pacino, one of the greatest American actors of all time being wasted in an unimportant minor role. No, It's just not enough to show myself ( and the world): I am so cool I don't need to care about a story. There is no focus, no timing, no story-line at all. What's it all about for more than two hours? The only sequence that works is the final one, exploding violence in the most grotesque way you can imagine, at least we are familiar with that.
And by the way: rewriting history? Didn't Tarantino use this trick for a finale in Inglourious Basterds before, but more convincing there? 4 stars for set design and camera work., because I am generous."
70," Tarantino once again!
","Tarantino does it once again! He proved that he is one of the best directors.
This is the best movie of the year right now, and will definitely be at the oscars."
71," What a disappointment...
",I am absolutely gutted about this. I really expected a lot from this movie and I got nothing in return. Truthfully if it wasn't for Brad Pitt this movie would have been completely dull so the five stars go to Brad Pitt and the ode to the Swinging 60s before it's demise.
72," Worst Tarantino Movie
","I'm a big fan of Tarantino movies, but I have to admit that this is his worst movie, a waste of a brilliant cast, for a movie without purpose. The typical Tarantino ending was meaningless in this movie, it looks like we're watching two different styles, one that happens throughout the whole movie, and one in the final scene. Very boring movie. The usual phenomenon of ""high scoring film just because the director is reputable"", I realize that it should make people feel intellectual by always giving good marks to well-known filmmakers, but it really misleads those who are guided by IMDB scores. If this movie were from a lesser known director the IMDB score would probably be 5/6."
73," Outstanding
","I absolutely loved everything about this movie.I've been a bit perplexed by the number of poor reviews. I think it's because Tarantino doesn't spend any time introducing the historically real characters. He assumes the viewer knows who all of the key players are the second they appear on the screen and what their place/fate was in history. To really enjoy this movie you have to know the background story in advance that permeates the entire movie including all of the key players (Charles Manson, Sharon Tate, Roman Polanski, Squeaky Fromme, Susan Atkins and Tex Watson among others)."
74," Tarantino's worst film
","Great cinematography, scenery, and acting...but, pointless story that goes nowhere. One great 10m scene at the ranch where you think 'ok now it's going somewhere' then it just...doesn't."
75," 2 hours of mellow boredom for 15 minutes of gore
","I've expected more from Tarantino than having to sit through 2 hours of Hollywood retro everyday grind, to come to a sudden finale for wake-up. Both DiCaprio and Pitt have more talent than to be wasted this way. Well, things change."
76," Another Matured storyline from a world class director; Tarantino!
","Wow! Just WOW!! Trailers nearly put me off and never felt like watching this movie, now I'm just in love. Witness some solid acting, performance and matured storyline from a world class director; Tarantino. Makes me love Pitt and Leonardo more. Really recommend this movie to all movie goers.. this is some Masterpiece to end my 2019 with👌🏾"
77," Dragging & boring
","Kinda pretentious. Nothing happens, It is dragging and never seems to come to any point. I fully understand it is an hommage to the era, but playing a few tunes from the era and throwing in some (really) bad casted people such as a really bad Bruce Lee impersonator. I've seen better on the Las Vegas Strip.This might be QT worst movie. If it was done by anybody else, it would have never seen the light of day."
78," Incredible!!
","This is what you can call a real Hollywood movie, especially in this era of CGI deception and waves of stupid political correctness. Not only did I feel and absorb every scene of it, but also it was like being part of those scenes and the movie itself. This is a pure art and a picture awarding masterpiece, and if it's not, should Hollywood hippies and their political correctness trend get burn till their very roots."
79," I love Tarantino!
","There nothing much more to say than its a Tarantino movie. The story of a Hollywood actor and its stunt double. You have all the Tarantino ingredients: Great build up, amazing actors and a very unorthodox story. I can only recommend this movie."
80," No 'ifs' or 'buts' about it - it's a masterpiece
","Almost 3hrs of pure luxury on your ears, eyes and brain. What more could anyone want?Tarantino tells a risky, enthralling, involved and deeply nuanced story of an actor facing personal struggles with bipolar disorder, self-medication, his career, and a possible future without the companionship of his stunt double and close friend.The tale advances adjacent to a what-might-have-been version of an notorious incident in history. Tarantino tells it in a style and richness of detail that surpasses all he's done before.It left me moved, gobsmacked, and desperately wanting to watch it again.Oh! Also includes best use of a tin of dog food in cinema history 10/10"
81," Loved it!
","I loved this movie so much. I don't now why people say it's bad. It's very good. It wasn't boring. I know it wasn't a typical Tarantino film, but it was one of the best films I watched. I loved the actors so much. And a I really really loved the last 15 minutes. So this film was THE BEST I saw in a very very long time!"
82," Greatness as always
",This movie has two great leads who perform masterfully. The flow and feel of the movie is also great. One of the best movies so far this year and an ending that was very unpredictable. Once Upon A Time In Hollywood go see it it's worth it.
83," Hard to explain but worth every minute
","This movie is so hard to try to describe to people. It's a ""movie within a movie"" type scenario with characters that you may be familiar with. Great acting, visually perfect, and a great soundtrack. 2 1/2 hours long but it doesn't feel like it. Go see it!"
84," Be prepared to wait... for nothing to happen
",Such a shocking film. Near 3 hours worth of waiting for a small amount of action with 15 minutes to go.
85," Phenomenal
","Best Tarantino movie ever. Even in front of Pulp Fiction. If you were born between 1960 and 1965 you probably will enjoy it even more. But the storyline, the cinematography, Di Caprio's acting and the music all complimented this true masterpiece. Also, the ending was so well portrayed."
86," The best Tarantino movie, with a symbolic and powerful ending.
","It has to be one of the most gorgeous, cinematic and powerful movies I've ever seen.It's of paramount importance that you know the history of Sharon Tate, what happens to her, and the Manson family.The ending is incredible, symbolic and sad. But remember the title's name is Once Upon a Time, this should give you a nod to a somewhat alternate ending."
87," I can still feel the magic in his movies.
","Well, if you know that you are watching a QT movie than you will find this movie great. I enjoyed every minute.Many people can say, that the movie does not have a point, but trust me, it does.I would say that this is one of my favorite movies."
88," A Bittersweet Fairytale
","Once Upon a Time In Hollywood is Quentin Tarantino's 9th film, and the standard he set himself with his previous work and without a doubt this movie has lived up to it. The characters are well-written and explored in great detail and acted amazingly, especially by Margot Robbie and Brad Pitt.The movie has a very distinct tone. It's a mood-film that serves as an experience to drop into. Setting a tone and exploring the scenery, period and characters seems to be primary next to Story and I love that. Whereas I think some people may have a problem with the scenes playing more to developing a world rather than telling a story, I loved each set-piece and small story that took place.There's definitely some pacing issues with the beginning but the way the third act is written and the tone of the middle section makes up for it. I especially love how fairytale the movie is, everything is very perfect and intentionally cheesy which fits in with the title beginning with ""Once Upon a Time,"". This is a movie that takes place in its own movie world, where everything plays out like movies do but in reference to a real life event, something horrible and completely unfairytale, since movies, especially ones from the 60s, are meant to be, distractions from the horrific reality. This movie takes something horrible and inserts two cheesy action heroes into it, mocking the escapism found in classic cinema.The movie has beautiful cinematography and editing choices and a very neatly-chosen soundtrack. It may be too slow-paced in certain parts but that's something I can get behind
9/10"
89," Alright... you either love or you hate it... I loved it.
","I went to cinema to see this without reading any reviews and expecting full-on Tarantino but no. He took a simple route... for two hours. People say that it's not good because it's got no plot or story but I disagree. It's got build-up, it's got energy. Scenes made me laugh and feel uneasy.MAJOR SPOILERS AHEADBut they are all parallel stories.Rick is trying to become a successful actor again and with the help of Trudi, he finds it.Cliff gets connected with the Manson family after struggling to get a job with Rick after fighting Bruce.Sharon is living her life as a party animal and has quite a small story but there were so many scenes that made me marvel how Margot played this character, including the scene at the theatre - it was just so cool to see how she reacted to people watching her movie.It has humour, it has uneasiness... it's a mixed bag. My cousin watched her first Tarantino movie and was told it was going to be violent. I can't imagine the shock of watching two hours of comedy, outstanding acting and a badass character (in case, you didn't know, Cliff Booth who deserves an Oscar for this role) and then people start getting mauled by Brandy, my favourite on-screen dog! If you loved the ending to Inglorious after seeing Hitler blown to pieces, you will love the Manson family being torched and their heads being bashed to a pulp.The pay-off after 2 hours is amazing. Did I also say it's probably got the coolest soundtrack ever?"
90," Tarantino at his best.
","Finally. A fresh movie with complete originality and a story that leaves you wanting more. Brad and Leo paired together again, present an astounding and quite wonderful take on the 60's.The first two hours are a little slow yet still convincing and gripping in more ways than one. The last forty minutes are classic Tarantino. Humour, blood and violence all mixed into a perfect cocktail that delivers moment after moment of movie bliss.I want more already. Keep it coming."
91," A very unusual movie, even for Tarantino.
","I believe that a lot of people didn't understand this movie like there's no sense or something. I can't say it has a really deep meaning but a nice idea with perfect realization. The story about 3 actors on Hollywood in different perspective. The actor that reaches the highest peak of actor carrier, stuntman and actress having satisfaction from positive reaction on her movie role. And it's really interesting to watch each of them because with the great performance, characters feel so natural. I feel that it's like a genre that Tarantino try to make and maybe it will affect in his future films. So, Quentin Tarantino once again made an awesome and entertaining movie."
92," Tarantino did it again
","Back to the oldskool! Tarantino delivered again a masterpiece. No fancy scenes done by computer images.. No a real movie that brings a big salute and dedication to the old way of movie making. The multiple stories that come across , fantastic dialogs with a lot of humor, real historic true stories used in the story line, fantastic combinations of music across all the scenes. And with a fantastic cast. Leonardo Dicaprio and Brad Pitt are playing a stunning performance!"
93," Best film of the year so far
","5 stars guys cmon?
Yh it's different from his other films but why is it that as soon as something is different everybody starts giving it ridiculous 4 or 5 star reviews..."
94," Just watch the last 15 min.
",The rest is so drawn out and unnecessary. The depiction of Bruce Lee was an insult.
95," Just so boring and pointless
","When folks around you in a full cinema are snoring you know something is seriously wrong!
So boring, so pointless, such a self-indulgent piece of long winded rubbish!
If we didn't have wine and popcorn to finish we would not have stayed to the end.
Even during the climax we were asking, ""is it over now? can we leave?""
I can assure you; there was no applause in my cinema when it finally finished!"
96," Love Tarantino - disappointing movie
","Husband and I love Tarantino and were very excited to see this film. After the first 20 minutes or so, we became so bored that we contemplated leaving the theater. We didn't, and stayed for the whole thing, but the only truly interesting and exciting part was the last half hour or so. Very disappointed."
97," Back to the Past
","This Tarantino masterpiece is simply the best, better than all the rest, particularly if you grew up in the 50s, 60s and 70s which I did. As others who reviewed this have said, it's had not to review with spoilers but I'll try. The research done to create the film was obviously amazing! The music, the film/TV references and the history all contributed to make ... ""In Hollywood"" entertaining, shocking and reminiscent of reality back in 1969. The ending presented what we all wish could've happened in 8/69. I never saw it coming til the Spahn ranch car pulled away from Cielo Drive, leaving 3 not 4 to do the dirty work. And I'll stop here. I loved it!"
98," Best Third Act of any Tarantino film
","Going into this movie, audiences worldwide can come to an agreement that over the years, a sense of trust with Quentin Tarantino has been built, as he has never made a BAD movie, or even a 'meh' one. 'Once Upon aTime in Hollywood' confirms his role as one of the most influential directors in this industry. The set design is brilliant, the acting is oscar-worthy, the dialogue is clever, the screenplay is unique, the list can go on. But I think that this movie really shines in its third act, leaving all audiences with a sense of satisfaction. Some may argue that this ending is not worth the long-feeling second act, but for me it most definitely did. I think it really comes down to what type of movies you enjoy. Those who enter this movie thinking that they are in for a rollercoaster of gore and snappy Tarantino out of the blue moments may be disappointed, but those who adore his movies for the unforgettable dialogue are in for a ride. Also, the third act provides plenty of Tarantino moments for an ultimate time in the theater. For me, this is one of the best movies of the year."
99," Slow burner that's worth every minute
","I can already hear the haters complaining that it's too long, too slow, and that there's not enough action. For a movie that takes such a leisurely pace to get to where it's going, it whizzed by for me. Part buddy pic, party homage to EVERYTHING going on in 1969, and part alternative universe. The entire thing works so well! Your ability to love, or hate the movie rests on how well you connect with Pitt & DiCaprio from the start. It's not a film about Sharon Tate, or Charles Manson, or the murders that followed. The story belongs to those two leads and everything else is done around them to tie the narrative together. A truly, rewarding and very mature movie from QT."
100," Took my breath away
","Tarantino's best. By the end of the film, I was literally crying. Bittersweet, really. Best ending I've seen in a while.I especially loved the true-grit nature of Brad Pitt's character (and his dog). And kudos to the rest of the cast, including DiCaprio, who flexed his considerable acting talent, and also to the young lady (Julia Butters) who played an eight-year-old actress on one of the sets.The music, costumes, makeup, sets, and locations totally nailed the era. The whole crew did a great job.I will watch this movie again; I loved it that much.(BTW, I don't know if everyone in the audience 'got' the film. My advice, if you're not super familiar with the Charles Manson story, is to watch the 2004 Helter Skelter TV film or read the book Helter Skelter.)"
101," Tarantino at his most misunderstood
","This movie is absolutely not for everyone, and a lot of people regard it as plain boring. I, on the other hand, found it intriguing and heart warming at times. The story follows a has-been actor, Rick Dalton (played by Leonardo DiCaprio), struggling for a comeback at the dawn of New Hollywood. His stunt double, Cliff Booth (played by Brad Pitt), follows his peer but manages his time fixing stuff at Rick's house. The entire film functions as 'a day in the life' of these characters - which include the late Sharon Tate (played by Margot Robbie). As Rick sees his shot at making a comeback by starring in spaghetti westerns on the other side of the globe, he returns to Hollywood with a slightly changed mindset, beset on his inevitable downfall. He and Cliff kicks back and accepts their fate, which coincidentally occurs on the same night of the Manson murders - and Rick is the next door neighbor of Tate. After discovering that Rick Dalton lives next to Tate, history takes a slight shift as the Manson family decides upon killing Rick because he ""taught them how to kill"" with his violent TV westerns of the 50s - a snarky comment on the critique of Tarantino's own films. Cliff and Dalton quickly dispatches of the Manson members in a cathartic, Tarantino-esque way, and Dalton is invited by Tate to her house - a symbol of his return to Hollywood. 'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood' finds Tarantino contemplating the tumultuous era and does so in a character study. Rick Dalton's feelings of loss of pride and meaning is thoroughly felt, and his moments of glory sparks an enormous joy in the audience. I believe 'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood' to be one of Tarantino's best, but absolutely his most misunderstood film."
102," LOVED IT
","This movie was without a doubt society's revenge on the Manson family freaks for what they did to their victims! God bless Quentin! I cried bittersweet tears at the end, wishing that the end is what had really happened."
103," A great hangout movie!
","Many people said this movie is drag, boring, no plot or direction. I tell you guys: THIS IS A HANG-OUT MOVIE!
I watched this movie twice already and i feel want to watch it over and over again. For me 161 minutes is very short to enjoy the vibe of 1960's City of Angels, and feel like I'm hanging-out with the characters while watching this movie. Its like 'Dazed and Confused' (1993)by Richard Linklater where there is no plot in that movie but brought me the enjoyment
Every time i watched Once Upon A Time In Hollywood it brings me comfort to every second."
104," A film I will surely watch multiple times
","One of the most enjoyable times I've had at the movies in years. DiCaprio is simply wonderful complimented by a nuanced, delicious Brad Pitt. Margo Robbie is stunning and delivers a very sensitive, lovely Sharon Tate. Can't wait to watch it again and again. Kudos to Kurt Russell. Truly one of Tarantino's best. Bravo"
105," What a film !!!
","Honestly this film is like no other.... QT has smashed it again I'm a huge fan of his work I mean a few of his films have been slow we can all accept that but this film has me interested from the first scene...this film contains comedy, violence and even a bit of thriller this film had my hands sweating in some scenes it's like no QT film ever but it felt like a QT film...the music is what makes a Tarantino film and this had some great 60-70 tunes....honestly one of the best films I've seen in a long time"
106," Great all-around
",The movie was beautiful and the pacing was pure art
107," A mixed bag
","Large portions of the movie kept me engaged, but as a whole it was too meandering. The finale was entertaining, but not exactly satisfying.I think with a more cohesive plot and a bit more time in the editing room, this would have been killer, but as is it just didn't do it for me."
108," Still Thinking About It
","I just saw this movie this evening and am still thinking about it. I read other reviews, and believe I see a pattern as to why some didn't like it, and I think it's just lack of appreciation of the time and the storytelling. It was an homage. I remember tv of that era: weekly westerns and crime dramas like Gunsmoke or Perry Mason. Shows that had guest stars who were usually familiar actors from movies or older shows. It was a love story about friendship and honor. What others said was too much jumping around wasn't really paying attention. It clearly stated the dates of what was happening. It was highlighting moments in each character's lives to convey their emotions in addition to tying up the end. And I believe it was a fairytale, hence the title ""Once Upon A Time...""."
109," One of the best movies I have seen in a while.
","This is definitely one of the best we have seen from Tarantino. As an avid Tarantino fan, I can say without a doubt that this is in the running for his best picture ever. The acting, the characters QT created, the cinematography, the music, the 60s vibe were all marvelous to encounter. A genuinely funny movie, but also suspenseful. A must-see IN THEATERS!! Would not want this movie any other way. Well done!"
110," Art can be fun!
","Haven't had this much fun since Pulp Fiction. Finally some terrific entertainment that isn't a comic book character or a lot of cgi. I'm rating it 10 because I can't think of a way it could have been better. There wasn't a minute in this film where I wasn't interested, engaged, and eager to keep watching. It's punchy, funny, LA glamourous, colourful yet noir-ish, the violence is gutsy and visual but it's Tarantino, so not just a run of the mill punch up shoot out--always a surprise and enough of a twist that you can't help laughing. The editing is an excellent juxtaposition of scenes and images. Lots of recognizable memories if you're a boomer--you'll be going ""oh yeah, that's right!"" But more than that, it has characters who are interesting, not just cutout action figures, but human beings, from the lead roles to the bit parts. This looks like a movie where the actors sincerely got into the spirit--art can be fun!"
111," Once upon a time .... is truly high art
",All of the 10/10 reviews say it all. This is a movie that sticks with you. Seen it twice in the two days it was released. On my way to see a third :-)
112," Masterpiece
",If you're looking for perfection... you found it. The story and acting grips you from start to finish and is rewatchable over and over again. Timeless classic.
113," Outstanding Picture, slow build
","A visually captivating movie by Tarantino. Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio played their characters to perfection and will most likely get oscars for their efforts. Trailers paint this movie to make it seem Margot Robbie's Sharon Tate is a main character, which is not the case, so don't go in thinking it's mainly about Manson, because you'll be disappointed. The last 20 minutes or so is classic Tarantino. Brad Pitt is hilarious and it's just fun to see him in this role. A very well done drama, just remember one thing, this movie is mainly a DRAMA. Not a normal Tarantino action movie, he focuses more on bringing back the narrative of what a movie is supposed to be, instead of some of the lousy pictures we get today. 10/10 for #9. Can't wait for #10, his official bow. It's going to be a classic."
114," 1969 Never Looked So Good
","Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is a film that is aesthetically appealing from start to finish. Quentin Tarantino's interpretation of 1969 Hollywood is a lush world with superb detail. This movie serves as a love letter to the place Tarantino presumably grew up with.The cast features an All Star ensemble of actors. Whether supporting or main, every character in this film is portrayed with excellence. Leonardo DiCaprio continues to flex his acting prowess in his portrayal of Rick Dalton. DiCaprio's Rick Dalton is a classic take on the waning career of a once successful actor. His emotion as Rick Dalton is felt in a comical and rewarding sense. His anguish is felt prominently within this film. DiCaprio continues to be brilliant. Margot Robbie's portrayal of Sharon Tate is graceful and wholesome. Robbie's ability to emote with facials alone is true talent. Her on screen presence grants the film and audience with a sense of euphoria. Brad Pitt's character of Cliff Booth is a bad ass in every aspect. His portrayal of the character is presented with an enduring chip on the shoulder. When Cliff Booth is on screen, the film is given security. Pitt continues to exhibit why he is a name that should always be in the discussion of great actors. Pitt's chemistry with DiCaprio's Rick Dalton is excellent. Both men play off each other in a manner that makes you believe they are best friends in real life. On rare occasions will you get a chemistry more authentic than this. Rick and Cliff mirror that of Abbott and Costello, or Batman and Robin. Both men were made for these roles and are symbiotic to one another.The dialogue in this film is up to par with the rest of Tarantino's filmography. Every word feels natural, and every encounter is perfect. Tarantino continues his streak of quotable One liners. Tarantino does an excellent job of flexing his knowledge of 1969 Hollywood within his dialogue and writing. The film is masterfully paced as well. The flashbacks don't step on the present story and they add incredible depth to an ever growing tale. The film is slow paced in that it adds background and detail to the characters and the world they live in. There are minor points of foreshadowing that tie in perfectly to the overall story. The payoff to this story is incredibly satisfying and unexpected. Tarantino is a master in storytelling at this point in his career.The film is shot beautifully. Every shot matters and serves a purpose. Tarantino exhibits his appreciation for 1969 Hollywood through long shots of beautiful scenery and diegetic sound. Tarantino's angling of the camera is natural, serving as a film student's wet dream. Once again, the world is incredibly lush. The soundtrack exhibits some of the best usage of music in recent cinema. At times the film feels like a big music video, however this does not take away from anything within the film. The music serves as the mascot for Tarantino's 1969 Hollywood. The music and the setting of 1969 Hollywood are inseparable.Overall, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is another masterpiece in Quentin Tarantino's filmography. Whereas Pulp Fiction excels in storytelling and dialogue, this film excels in storytelling and cinematography. 1969 never looked so good."
115," We dont deserve this movie...
","Thanks God cuz Pulp Fiction was made in another era, otherwise it would have been reviewed by nowdays audience, or fans of CGI and Fast and Furious. This movie like Pulp Fiction, is not about the plot. Pulp Fiction has no plot as well. Once upon a time in Hollywood is about the characters and about situations. You need to have some culture in movies to like this one. Of course is too long for if you started to watch movies after 2005. It s obvious that you never seen the old classic movies. Then you wondering why cinema has changed and we dont have good movies anymore. Because of you guys, new generation, with no patience, fans of CGi, Fast and Furious, etc. Cinema will never be the same because of nowdays audience without culture in movie. Thank you Tarantino for this amazing movie!"
116," Good acting, boring plot
","One of my favorite actors plays in this one so I have expected something great.The title was very good, the hype was real, 30 minutes into the cinema and I saw people leaving, 1 h into it and I was like get me out of here...It was something like I was watching LOTR but without action...just talking and acting.I am very disappointed with this one(don't get me wrong, the acting is great), probably because I had other expectations from it but overall it s just boring, except for the last 10-15 minutes of the movie...not fun, not entertaining, terrible."
117," Best since Inglourious Basterds
","Quentin Tarantino has delivered once again. Everything about this movie was just brilliant. The dialogue was classic Tarantino, the direction was impeccable, and the performances were all around phenomenal. It is consistently entertaining on every level. That final act was especially exciting, and honestly moved me in a way that I didn't expect. It gave a whole new meaning to the title, and really elevated the film. Easily Tarantino's best since Inglourious Basterds, and for my money, an instant classic. I was truly floored by it. A movie about movies made by a man who clearly loves film more than anybody. How could it have been anything but a masterpiece?10/10"
118," Amazing cinematography
","The movie is obviously not for everyone like any other 3 hour long movie. BUT if you stay till the end you will see the entire set of beautiful cinematography from the first 2 and a half hours collides in to a final half and hour Tarantino classic. Finishing scene is one of the best in movie history, but you have to watch the whole thing to get it. I enjoyed it and laughed like a child. Loved it!"
119," Great art
","Honestly speaking I love Brad performance too. Leo is extraordinary. Al, Luke among everyone else are amazing.
Impeccable movie.
Climax is undeniably seamless."
120," Some of his finest work to date
","This is some of QT's finest work he has ever produced. The reviewers leaving 1 star claiming it is boring and nothing happens probably enjoy trash like the Avengers. This is a masterful slow burn build up to a big crescendo and is essentially a fairytale set to the backdrop of the Hollywood hills. The soundtrack is incredible and weaved in cleverly via the radio of Rick's Coup Deville. One reviewer claimed it was a pointless movie full of scenes from other movies. These scenes help to build Rick's character and display the existential crisis he finds himself in and craft his rollercoaster mental state. They are not pointless, merely the IQ of the viewer was too low to appreciate their significance. The movie is HIP, COOL and beautiful and expertly crafted. Some describe it as self indulgence, it couldn't be further from the truth, this is a love letter to a by-gone era and those who lived it. I don't expect your average millennial to appreciate much less understand this movie. I personally thought the ending was wonderful and how he dealt with the matter of Sharon Tate was actually touching and heartfelt. Finally the bleeding heart liberals moaning about Bruce Lee's portrayal are honestly pathetic. I love Bruce Lee and his movies and I found the scene to be hilarious, this is Hollywood, its supposed to be fun!
I'll finish with saying, this isn't a movie for FILTHY HIPPIES! :-)"
121," I was taken back to Hollywood 1969
","This is my first review ever, so i'm going to try my best here.I loved this movie! I mean LOVED it! Not just because i'm a huge Tarantino fan, but because I was taken back in time to Hollywood 1969, when Hollywood was in its Golden age. Rick Dalton and Cliff Booth work so well together, Leo and Brad both give some of the best performances I've ever seen in film. Leo shows so much passion and love for acting when he's on screen, same goes for Brad. Margot Robbie was incredible! She gives a strong electric feel to Sharon Tate and lights up the whole movie when shes on screen. The whole cast was so well utilized. Each character feels alive and exciting! Tarantino once again gives us an incredible film, which he crafted so perfectly, with every shot. The music, story, and era of this film play a part in the experience and I cannot recommend it enough."
122," Can't satisfy everyone
","Awesome movie. Glad to have watched it on Thursday at the first showing. If you're a Tarantino fan you will love it, if not you'll find something to nitpick. Is it perfect ? No, but it's a perfect film to add to Tarantino's list. Can't wait for movie 10."
123," This is a must see!
","If you are one who likes any of Tarantino's other films or if you really like well designed movies than this is something you have to see! This movie was very well done and is incredibly interesting.Tarantino really does take the whole movie back in time and makes it feel completely like it is 1969. Brad Pitt's acting was very top notch and DiCaprio's is so interesting.This movie does start off kinda slow, but very charming about it. Throughout the movie it just keeps building up and up and up! Leading to an ending that completely surprised me. If you know how the Tate murder happened and are expecting it than you will be surprised by this twist they pull out at the last second. (Fictional ending)"
124," Beyond Words
","Just go watch it. Everything about this film is phenomenal. From the musical choices, the dialogue, camera angles(the box office scene may be my favorite scene of the film), to how the mood changes based on which story you're telling; Quentin has done it again. This film will be studied for years to come, guaranteed."
125," Another great Tarantino flick
","First of all, I could not believe the movie was over when the credits came up. A 2 1/2 hour movie that seemed much, much shorter. Leo was good but Pitt was great. They play off each other wonderfully. Every scene with Pitt was gold. One of the few movies my wife has watched with me and she loved it. It was just a beautifully crafted movie."
126," Outstanding masterpiece
","This is a very well built movie, with very good characters and solid story lines. There are several different movies within the film.Brat Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio are at their best. You are able to empathize with them from beginning to end.Tarantino is an artisan that has delivered again a masterpiece.The ending is superb."
127," Wen't in the cinemas expecting Tarantino's best, but this felt far from it.
","Sure you can say the acting was great, the costume and set designs were amazing which they were, even the fact that the film had all the actors they could get their hands on. The main thing missing from this movie was a plot. Just imagine watching nearly a 3hr movie with no plot.. nothing happens, the end scene was super predictable and the main reason for this film was to show off how good the acting and set designs could be. I gave it a 7 because the execution with most elements were really well done quite clearly deserves that. But if you look for a good plot with some twists here and there and good character development don't watch this with high hopes because it offers none of that."
128," A Beautiful Homage to an Era Long Gone
","This may not be Tarantino's best film of all 9 he's accomplished, nevertheless, this one remains one of his finest works. Tarantino pays a very beautiful and marvelously done tribute to the Hollywood era that raised him and that stood out for being the last great epoch for American entertainment. If you've seen his previous films, you will notice he adds a touch of classic throwbacks through references of his favorite genres, from exploitation films to spaghetti westerns. In this film, however, it's an entire feature that perfectly encapsulates the era in which all those genres he dearly loves emanated from. Tarantino deviates us from his recognizable plot developments and instead takes us in a ""hang-out"" plot journey, in which what matters isn't necessarily what will happen to the characters, but what the characters are doing in a specific event. It's about getting to know the characters more personally, thus reciprocating with Tarantino's intention for the audience to be immersed into a 1960s Hollywood setting. If you watch closely, in this film, Tarantino focuses in the sound, (radio stations, TV shows announcers), and the images (cinemas, drive-ins, posters, city life), and uses the characters in order to navigate these time-era elements. It's definitely clear that Tarantino made this movie a nostalgia voyage, and he depicts this era as a precious gem that was taken away by the counterculture as its later expressed in the film. Truly for me this film experience was invigorating to my soul as a cinephile, Tarantino fan, and a lover of the classic genre."
129," Boring, boring, boring. Self-complacent ramblings about nothing
","To say that this movie is self-complacent would be a gigantic understatement. As gigantic maybe as Tarantino's memory, overloaded with scores of details that he doesn't care to sort out. So he unloads them in bulk. The result : it's like you go to a promising party but end up cornered most of the night by some drunk guy who absolutely wants to share his opinions about everything.Right from the start you get vignette after vignette, self-indulgent, overlong spoof sequences that bog down the main narrative. What with all the stuff Tarantino has learnt about movies he can't shorten exposition to clever ellipses ? Once upon a time I thought he was very good with dialogue, but I guess it is no fun to toil and write fine lines (no just snappy one-liners from time to time) when Sony will greenlight anything you want to shoot.Once upon a time in Hollywood does not have a plot. It is the New Wave auteur in Tarantino who does not think he needs a plot. He has a couple of characters, a dozen anecdotes and the rest is talent. Self-conscious talent, lazy talent, talent isolated in the middle of a creative process. More like naked skills, each trying separately to express its full potential.The hero and his sidekick are losers: how do you build a story around losers ? You need rhythm and some kind of McGuffin (wasn't it all there in Pulp Fiction?), not some vague exploration of the meaning of life. The plot is limited to the draft premise: a has-been TV actor and his stunt double cope with reality in Hollywood around the time of the Manson Family murders.
The backdrop of the murders is the only narrative asset. We are teased all along, we even have an extensive reconstitution of life at the Spahn Ranch... all this just to toy around and end with the kind of ultra-violent carnival that Tarantino fans seem to revere.
Clearly the challenge of mentioning the sordid Tate-LaBianca murders of August 1969 was not only above Tarantino's mental ability, but grossly using background anecdotes from it as fodder for his inspiration was within his moral scope.As always I am judging this movie on its merits from a movie enthusiast point of view. But Tarantino is much more than a movie enthusiast. He is a guttonous movie fanatic. He is a guru with followers who let themselves be impressed, just like with Charles Manson. Many more followers than Charles Manson; fortunately Tarantino followers are only trained to see the fun in violence."
130," Amazing...
","Outstanding acting, outstanding cinematography, outstanding film. By far the best movie I have seen this year. Thank you so much I am definitely going to watch it again"
131," It's A Rarity. And A Treasure.
","You'll 'get it 'or you won't. A review won't help that really. If you don't , you'll think it VERY long and boring and without any plot or real purpose. And on a certain level you won't be wrong. As a 'modern' 'A' list film it lacks 'pace'. No review can change your mind. -added Aug 3--- And judging by the number of ratings that are 3 and less, some of YOU didn't 'get it' .At all.
So why bother ? For those who do 'get it' it might be that even more rare film that gets 'better' the more you see it. Because,there is no REAL plot. There's just two 'average joe' guys living their lives for a set period in a very defined era. Does get a little heated near the end, but even then it's the story of of town built upon fairy tale endings.
I'm going to watch it again, to pick out as many details now as I can. Because as is often said, it's NOT the destination; It's the journey.Edit: I have watched it over again. It's a gem. I changed my rating from 9 to 10 because even those few tiny examples of 'too much detail', weren't out of place and I understood why they were there. It does get better the more you watch it. It stays the same of course but YOU watch it differently. The dread you might have felt because of the supposed subject is gone and you can just enjoy the scenery and the trip. VERY highly recommended.
ps. Just in case for anyone seriously checking this flic out. Those low reviews are just wrong as wrong can be. This movie is going to be Oscar nominated in MULTIPLE categories. It should win in many of them. Hollywood itself is saying so.
Just GO."
132," Tarantino's best film.
",This film is really beautiful. The acting is wonderful. Everything about the film works.
133," A wasted opportunity
",Slow is an understatement waiting for the finale that lasted only 15 mins. 15 mins at the end is what we were expecting the whole movie to be like. Great acting ruined by slow pace. Anyone who gives this more than 4 stars has no idea what movies should be like. Like Apple fans they can't admit a mistake has been made. Never seen so many people walk out of a movie
134," More than a love letter to hollywood.
","Yes it's true. This film is a love letter to hollywood and all it stood for, but it's more than that. It is set in 1969, wich is the beginning of the end of the golden era of hollywood ( and the hippie era). The Manson murders ar the reason for that. This sixties is filled with hapiness and hope for the future. This is best shown in the character of Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie). Every seen with her is lovely and filled with joy. What makes it at the same time sad to watch because of what happens to her.I suggest that whoever wants to watch this movie should educate themselves about the manson murders. It really makes the experience of the movie better. Every scene gets more meaning. I think the fact that people don't know what happended is the biggest reason why people misunderstand this movie.The other character Rick Dalton ( Leonardo dicaprio) is an actor who sees the industry around him change and he has to change with it in order to survive in the industry. This is QT reflecting on himself as a director. The industry is changing ( endless sequels and the ever-growing MCU) and Tarrantino thinks of himself as an old hound. This is QT most selfreflecting movie.At the base there is a lot of classic Tarrantino to, references to, other movies, violence, realistic dialogues, cool characters ( ex. Brad Pitt)The title is a reference to a spaggethiwestern ( once upon a time in the west) because Rick Dalton plays in spaghettiwestern.
Once upon a time is also the beginning of a fairy tail. And this movie is a modern fairy tail.Tarrinto takes us on a ride trough the hollywood he knew and gives Sharon Tate the ending she deserves."
135," Nothing happens and ending is VERY unsatisfying
","Just got back from watching this film and felt like nothing happened and the last 15 minutes was exactly like Inglorious Bastards where they change up history but QT has already done this and 2 previous Western type films prior and everything the viewer had been waiting for amounted to pointless unsatisfying violence.
Great for a film documentary for the most part but most of the picture is just 60s film and tv clips with celebrity cameos."
136," Mediocre Movie
","I'll be honest, I've never seen a Tarantino movie before. I am turned off by excessive violence, particularly for no purpose. But I decided to go see this one as I was told the violence was not as bad. My sister raved about the script, which I found so-so. The movie dragged in places and was not particularly clever The view of Hollywood in those days was very cliché. They had the actors go to all the normal Hollywood watering holes, so that took no thought on the part of the writer. It was a bland story, and then when it went towards the end, I was horrified that we were trying to find humor when we knew what really happened at the end of that night. Yes, it was a fairytale and yes, Sharon Tate's sister okayed this movie, but I found it offensive for younger people as this will be their only reference of the Manson story. The Manson girls were portrayed as pretty and funny, not the ( possibly brainwashed ) sociopaths that they were.My grades:Script: C
Direction: B
Acting: A- **Note: Brad Pitt deserves a Oscar nomination. The acting was the only thing that saved this movie for me."
137," Instant classic
","I felt like I went back in time. So much nostalgia throughout the movie. Leo, Brad and Margot were at the top of their game. These fine actors never fail to disappoint."
138," Tarantino meets realism
","This is a typical Tarantino style film, violent and funny. The jokes are throughout the film and the violence steps in when dealing with hippies. On the other hand, the film is also quite realistic and offers a sharp sarcasm towards Hollywood, stars and hippies. Pitt is handsome as ever, and DiCaprio gives one of the best performances of his career. The screenplay and editing are phenomenal."
139," Phenomenal
","I really felt this was in Tarantino's top films. They was more enjoyable than ""Hateful Eight."" Tarantino is all about dialogue and a story that intwines with each other. The story , the characters and the great dialogue was just exciting to watch and enjoyable. It put you on the edge of your seat which Hateful Eight did not. Hateful eight was an hour too long. This was too short in my eyes. I could watch these characters for another 30 mins. Brad Pitt made the movie and probably one of his best performances ever on his storied career. Leo was good like always. The fact how Tarantino loves to change history makes his movies very enjoyable. Who wants to really see what went down that night. If you really want to know go buy Helter Skelter. I did back in 1997 and read the whole book. I also have many stories on that night as well and others. You don't need to see it in a film. The music the cut scenes. The old Hollywood was just phenomenal. I loved it and seen it twice! Thing I don't like is the rating has dropped from 9.1 to 8.5,8.4?? Because of idiots who don't know what a film represents."
140," A Bonkers Tarantino Fairy-Tale with Golden-Age Hollywood Nostalgia
","A bonkers fairy tale in classically-Tarantino fashion with pure nostalgia-hued Golden Age-Hollywood homages, soundtrack as provocative as its brilliant screenplay, star-studded cast of stellar performances, & wild final act. 9.4/10....Review: 1960's: Manson x Golden-Age (leading into Renaissance/New Age) Hollywood. That was the tall order we were promised by legendary filmmaker Quentin Tarantino for his 9th outing, one made even more tantalizing by the trailer & announcement of a once-in-a-lifetime cast from Leonardo DiCaprio to Brad Pitt to Margot Robbie. After such inimitable masterpieces as Django Unchained, The Hateful Eight, Kill Bill Vols. 1/2, Inglorious Basterds, Reservoir Dogs, and Pulp Fiction, the film world's eyes were all on July 25th like the premiere of any blockbuster film in its namesake ritzy town's backdrop, and Tarantino delivered yet again - Oh *boy*, did he deliver. A bonkers fairy tale in classically-Tarantino fashion with pure nostalgia-hued Golden-Age Hollywood homages, soundtrack as provocative as its brilliant screenplay, star-studded cast of sensational performances, & wild final act, Once Upon A Time in Hollywood is one of Tarantino's greatest films ever.Nostalgia to Hollywood's Golden Age with plenty of Easter Eggs and eulogies to filmmaking. What's easily the highlight of OUATIH is its golden paean esteems and invocation of the best of Hollywood's history through every sensory way imaginable. It's truly like taking a joyride through the annals of film archives and will smack a goofy grin on any cinephile's face for its ~3 hour time period that flickers by in a flash. More classic film posters, TV serial snippets, lunchboxes, vinyl-pop, and radio-ads than can possibly be mentioned with meticulous attention to detail and period-authenticity make for a sensational trip through the escapist fare of moviemaking's best era. It even features clever fourth-wall-breaking/meta references to the artform showing (with classic Tarantino whim, wry humor, and unmistakeable energy) the process of filmmaking with everything from messed-up lines, cuts, shot-reversals, and replays of scenes as people come together across specialties to try to create filmic products that stand the test of the time.The cinematography to soundtrack to location settings majestically paint the glamour and ritzy lives of the rich and famous in Hollywood Hills' idyllic settings as promised - only to be shaken up by the events of its equally-brilliant screenplay. Paralleling all this settings-glamour is an equally dazzling display of storytelling with rich characters who make the film. The screenplay is masterful - this is pantheon-level filmmaking here - juggling 3-4+ storylines simultaneously with ease before uniting them all for the wild signature final act as promised by QT's filmography. We are taken through Hollywood studio backlots with insecure has-been movie star Rick Dalton trying desparately to save his career, a juxtaposed-rougher lifestyle for his sacrificial stunt-double Cliff Booth, trophy wife/model Sharon Tate jumping between romances in LA-superficiality fashion, and a Manson cult arc creeping under the surface like a serial killer slipping between the cracks.The performances. Leonardo DiCaprio absolutely (predictively) steals the show as lead with one of his most hilarious and out-there performances to date; Pitt is equally as infectious in personality as support with an intriguing exposure of the double-standard in film treatment between the people just ""reading lines other people wrote for them"" and those doing the dangerous stuntwork behind-the-scenes (also makes an iconic buddy-duo that needs its own couple of films with these two legendary actors tossed together for an extremely unique, refreshing mix!), Margot is a nice soothing juxtaposition storyline undeniably a treat for the eyes while also given a mini-romance arc with potentially-catastrophic results, and there is not a weak link to be found in the rest of the cast/cameos as the story escalates and twists until the final act as bravato-filled, wild, and bonkers as could only be found in a Tarantino film.The final act. One of the craziest final acts I can remember of late - only really rivalled by other Tarantino films as a signature big boom ending characteristic of his filmography, Once Upon A Time In Hollywood ends with a tremendous bang that adds triumphant final punctuation to this bonkers fairy tale set in the nightlit views of the motion picture capital. Immaculately tying all story threads together while also leaning heavy into its Manson arc with his cult trying to break in and kill some socialites in the Hollywood Hills on beckon-command, they meet a much different ending than they anticipated for MAXIMUM drink-spitting entertainment value - with everything from flamethrowers to butcher knives to dog-attacks to sleeping pills to incessant yells. What's even more impressive in the finale and throughout the film is that Tarantino absolutely silences any of his (imbecilic) critics/detractors claiming his films have ""too much gore/cussing"" (he's stayed true to his promised style of brazen irreverency since PULP FICTION, fools) by shockingly having almost none of what was perfectly licenseable to have given it's a film set around the events of the Manson murders: gore and violence. Instead we are just taken on a ~3-hour road trip amenable to all discernible tastes through masterful characteristic Old-World storytelling any real film aficionado can bask in the glory of for hours.Minor flaws in Once Upon A Time in Hollywood include a comparatively-smaller role for Margot Robbie than was expected and Manson arc I wish was a little more pronounced/fleshed-out. Margot is only really shown in glimpses and not utilized nearly to the full of her considerable acting talents, and we only get one actual glimpse of Charlie Manson (a perfect look-alike as well nonetheless) and few glimpses of his cult until the spectacularly-entertaining ending I really wish had gotten more screentime for its massive EV-value. Even a couple of slasher scenes or teases placed throughout would've done the trick, perhaps in place of some of the nostalgia-leaning in the first act that's undeniably enchanting but might've been better served for a bit more balance....Overall, Once Upon A Time In Hollywood is a masterpiece and one of Tarantino's best films to date - an incredible feat given his already-illustrious filmography that keeps getting one-upped every outing he gives. A bonkers fairy tale in classically-Tarantino fashion with pure nostalgia-hued Golden-Age Hollywood homages, soundtrack as provocative as its brilliant screenplay, star-studded cast of sensational performances, & wild final act, OUATIH cements Tarantino as easily one of the Top 3 Directors of All-Time in my book, as well as one of the greatest auteurs and most influential/inimitable masterminds the medium has ever seen.Overall Score: 9.4/10"
141," A slow burn exploding at the end
",This movie is slow to build a story. At times it's like you're watching 3-4 separate movies...one within one so to speak. Casting was spot on and the small appearances from late 60's icons was enjoyable. Great soundtrack and sets. All I can say is sit back ..settle in and enjoy. Definitely DiCaprio and Pitts best work to date.
142," Needs the second watch
","I got to say when i first watched the film i was confused, the film itself follows an odd narrative structure (I mean it's Tarantino ,like it ever was gonna follow a normal one) I still enjoyed it, but it felt off when watching it. i had a similar emotional curve watching pulp fiction. didn't enjoy it on the first watch but came to love it and each and ever watch it grows on me more and more. My brief summary would be, It's long, if you don't have an appreciation for 60's retro groove, the Hollywood system and stunning indulged cinematography the film may seem slow. This isn't helped by Tarantino's particular but resonating Dialogue. The last 30 minuets on the other hand, i can't imagine anyone not liking, its Bloody brilliant ;)For a person who doesn't appreciate the above... The question is whether you're willing to sacrifice two hours for a 30 minute climaxNow as to why i believe it requires a second watch, when watching for the first time everything is unexpected or at least could be. Anything could happen. Your brain is scowering for a plot, and in this film there isn't one, you're wondering what act of the film your in, will it end in 10 minuets? 5 minuets? This is true of all films but most of all Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. A second watch lets you relax and appreciate the subtle moments of the film, you know the end point of the film where its all heading towards. You're excited to see certain moments again, they may not be full of action but the acting and dialogue are superb. For me its a whole film chock full of the classic ""Royale with cheese"" which to me is the perfect Tarantino classic and why i gave it a 10/10"
143," Wonderful
",What a movie what a best ending ur gonna watch this movie again and again one of the best intelligent ending I ever seen in cinema ..bravo Tarantino ur genius and crazy lol and best acting for Brad Pitt and leonardo my fav actors :)) I loved da little girl lancer she is very smart and beautiful ..how come real story with fantasy of Tarantino omg wow 😍👌
144," An end of an era movie about the end of an era?
","Big budget blockbusters with adult themes and limited special effects are a dying breed in Hollywood. Quentin Tarantino is one of the few auteurs that makes them anymore. And if Once Upon a Time in...Hollywood is one of the last of a dying breed, it's an awfully good picture to go out on.As Tarantino regales about another dying breed 50 years ago, he packs his script with enough references and self-references for 10 movies. He concocts a detailed back-story for his lead with a filmography and film clips galore. There are also several movies within the movie. You'd probably have to watch it 3 or 4 times and take a graduate-level course on Hollywood in the 60s to catch all the Easter eggs- one that I haven't seen mentioned-Cliff's wife is named Natalie, and the mystery of her demise mirrors that of Natalie Wood. That's just one of like 1000.His depiction of Los Angeles in 1969 is an astounding feat. How are they driving down an LA freeway in broad daylight with what looks like actual traffic with nothing but 1960s cars? It doesn't look like CGI because it isn't! They shut down the highway! They built the storefronts, and recreated the movie posters, the interiors, and even the Spahn Ranch with obsessive attention to detail. It absolutely looks like 1969. It's utterly immersive. Stills would look exactly like a picture from that era.They didn't move the camera like this in 1969, though--long tracking shots following cars and horses and swooping crane shots over long-lost LA landmarks that take your breath away. I was giddy watching it. It'd be a great movie even without dialogue. But the script will have a good shot at an Oscar. The performances and casting are basically flawless. I wouldn't be surprised if DiCaprio snags another statue--and he might not be the only one.I really don't understand people that don't care for this picture. Is it a generational thing? The references are eluding the younger audience? They know little or nothing about schlocky 60s movies or TV or the Manson family? It's moves too slow for them? It's too long? (On a price per entertaining minute basis this might be the best deal ever!) Do they not appreciate real old-fashioned movie making that doesn't use CGI as a crutch? Because this film will be studied in film classes in 50 years, or 100 years. As a technical achievement, it's that good.The story is plenty good too, although if you are over a certain age like the director and myself, it will have more resonance. And it contains ample QT-style revenge for the schmoes who came for the ultra-violence.I guess I don't get what's not to like. It is a sublime movie going experience. I wonder how much longer they're going to make 'em like this. Outside of Tarantino and the Coens, maybe they've already stopped."
145," Once Upon a Time . . . . . . .
","Thanks Q.T. for writing this period piece. I was in the Army in 1969. It does homage to a well-known, historical truth by changing it. I almost left the theater half way when I perceived the subject. If it had been depicted I would have walked out. Instead, I can reflect on the truth without the details."
146," An entertaining and epic Tarantino film that most certainly lived up to the hype
","This being the 9th film by Quintin Tarantino, I was worried that there would be signs of fatigue but this couldn't be farther form the truth. Once upon a time in Hollywood is one of the best films of the year hands down. The performances from DiCaprio and Pitt are phenomenal as well as there chemistry on screen. The love letter to the golden age of Hollywood and the vibrant 1969 Las Angeles depicted in this film, envelope you in this time in history. Once upon a time in Hollywood is yet another Tarantino film that does not disappoint"
147," He's done it again!
","Tarantino has done it again! It's been a while since he's put anything out, but after seeing this movie...it was well worth the wait. If you are a Tarantino fan, I don't see how this film could possibly disappoint. Go see it in the theater! Don't wait forever for it to be available to stream. Heads up: It is a solid three hours long. So don't drink much because you won't want to miss anything. His original version he wanted to put out was 4.5 hours long (so I was told by a friend that read it from a credible source)! I think hard core Tarantino fans wouldn't have minded that. As long as they fit in a 15 minute potty break, I totally would rather have seen that version. Who knows what brilliance we missed out on! Haha!But seriously: If you are familiar with Tarantino's work and styles and/or a huge fan GO SEE IT SOON!!!! If you are reading this and you don't ""get"" Tarantino or know much about his works, you may be confused and not understand the film. It's very layered in an unexplainable way.Loved this film!! I hope you love and enjoy it as much as I did! Happy Tarantino-ing!"

149," A Must Watch For Film Lovers!
","This may not be the best of Tarantino films, but this still has the charm that can be compared to some of his classics! I recommend everyone, especially film lovers to watch this as it takes you on a journey during the late 60s by connecting it to real life events in a mature way."
150," Hollywood in its purest form
","Quentin Tarantino has absolutely nailed it! He has constructed every second in the movie in a whole new level. The cast, i mean those legends who has put their talent in a way that no one could complain. I swear guys, this movie will not disappoint you."
151," A Magnificent Masterpiece
","Quentin Tarantino's latest film, Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood, is truly my second favorite film that came out this year (first being John Wick 3), and next to Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill, it is one of Tarantino's greatest gems ever.This film takes place in 1969 in Hollywood, and features Rick Dalton (played by Leonardo Dicaprio), his stunt double Cliff Booth (played by Brad Pitt), and the beautiful Sharon Tate (played by Margot Robbie) make their way around an industry that is slowly disintegrating and changing. The film has different storylines and plays tribute to the golden ages to Hollywood's last amazing moments.This film was truly astounding. The three stars did a great job. Dicaprio was top notch with his performance, Pitt was tough and wild, and Robbie was wonderfully amazing. Other actors, like Al Pacino and Dakota Fanning and the rest of the great cast did a great job as well.The film may be 2 hours and 45 mins, but it keeps you very entertained all the way. The fist two hours is basically a tribute to good ol' Hollywood, and the last 45 mins is truly epic and is where things take a turn for the greatest.One last thing, this film proves this film can be truly original. The concept is very tremendous and was an interesting idea for a film.Bottom line, Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood was a very great film that I HIGHLY recommend to many people that are a fan of the three stars, that are a fan of Tarantino's films, and that are a fan of classic Hollywood times."
152," I do love a good fairy tale
","When I was an averagely small little girl, I wanted to be a princess. When I saw this movie I thought 'This could train me to be royalty' So I watched the movie because my imaginary friends aunt lives there. THIS MOVIE WAS GOOD. But where were the Disney characters?? I wondered this throughout the whole movie"
153," You either love or hate it. I LOVED it!
","I've always been a big QT fan and here he does something different but it is magical. The build up, the meandering of the plot that makes up the first two hours of the film can be thought of as boring but for me it was a beautiful way to set the scene of hollywood in the 60's and create an insight in the key players of the film. Apart from the outstanding performances of Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio, for me the conversations, sentences uttered and interactions between the players is THE strength of QT. A very mondane conversation he turns into a piece of art.The power of the last scene however is very dependent on the fact if you know what happened in real life with Sharon Tate and Manson. I did, so loved what QT made of it. But a lot of my friends (over here in Europe where it me be a bit lesser known) didn't and therefore didn't understand what the fuzz was all about.So in conclusion, great performance, beautifully directed (oh yeah, loved the music in it) and unique plot (for those who are aware of it)."

158," A Different Perspective
","The Manson murders signaled a loss of innocence in America, so it is surprising to see that sense of innocence caught on film in Tarantino's movie. Those who were alive in Los Angeles in the sixties will tell you he did an amazing job capturing the ""vibe."" Made me want to relive that era where everything was loose, free and easy. You can't judge this movie by traditional narrative standards as I don't think that was the point. After sitting through the surprise ending, I left the theater thinking ""What would this country look like today if that had been the case?"" I can only imagine."
159," Meh
","I'm a huge Tarantino fan, but the first 2hours of this movie are irrelevant, only the final act is enjoyable"
160," Original, but overly self-indulgent and meandering.
","I love the fact that Tarantino jumps from genre to genre and is happy to break the rules: have the narrator just jump in when he fells like it, include scenes that don't move the plot forward etc. if you can do it and make it work, then do it. Unfortunately, for me anyway, it doesn't really work.There are some cool scenes, a bit of humor with the dog, a bit of extreme violence, cool references to old movies, a good soundtrack; but the movie as a whole was too long and slightly boring. The references to the sixties in particular started to feel very self indulgent and they were just coming way too thick and fast for my liking. Another sign of the self-indulgence were the credits which included a bunch of actors as ""the gang"" and Tim Roth's inclusion in the credits, despite not appearing in the film (his scene was cut).To echo what others have pointed out, if this film was by an unknown with little know actors people probably wouldn't finish watching it and no-one would be calling it a masterpiece."
161," Tarantino at the height of his powers
","I've seen this film a few times now and I truly can't get enough. The brilliance displayed on screen is beyond the depths of human understanding. I feel it's so complex and simply entertaining at the same time. There is so much care and love here that makes each viewing experience different. I will be sad if Tarantino ever retires, because he is a filmmaker unlike any other. He will always cares for his films and have a deep love for them, which means he will never make a bad one. We love Mr. Tarantino!"

","I absolutely loved everything about this movie. DiCaprio, Pitt and Robbie were outstanding. I don't consider myself to be a huge Tarantino fan but do like several of his movies and this movie was very well done. Some parts were funny, some action and some eerie. A must watch for movie fans."
163," Fantastic!
","The film captures the essence of 1960's Hollywood to a T. Like the classics we all love, Tarantino has an incredible story telling style in which it is more about the characters developing around the story as opposed to the story developing around the characters. This is a film buffs film."
164," There wasn't a plot, but why did there need to be?
","Tarantino's new movie explored 3 sets of characters in an intermingled revisionist story that ultimately ended with a twist to how the Sharon Tate tragedy went. We enjoyed a film with deep character development told through flashbacks, interactions with fellow cast/crew members, and suspenseful moments that helped solidify the character's motives. The acting, cinematography, and sets gorgeously painted the picture in Tarantino's head for us to enjoy. In the same way that the Basterds kill Hitler, we're met with a twist that ultimately ends with Sharon Tate not dying, but instead an assault that plays out in the home of our protagonists, Rick and Cliff. It shares many concepts with that of Pulp Fiction, in that it's a nonlinear telling of a few stories that end in a climactic scene, but without a lot of the structure Pulp Fiction had to indicate what was happening or where we were. Ultimately, I think this decision added to the impending feeling of doom and unease that all the characters felt in their situations. It felt as if there was no plot because none of the characters were confident in where they were going to end up. We were just following the characters along for the ride, seeing what was going to happen to them as opposed to predicting where their stories would end. This movie is a different kind of masterpiece. It's unique and has bold storytelling choices, but I don't think it should be docked for being a different kind of story. An incredible feet for Quentin Tarantino, pun intended."

",Entertaining and satisfying. This film doesn't make you feel like you sat through a three hour movie.
166," California Dreaming.
","There may never be another filmmaker like Quentin Tarantino. If there is, we surely are in luck. But in all likelihood, future generations will just be students of his, and thank God for that fact alone. He's a filmmaker's filmmaker. His love of cinema verges on fetishism. His mission in life, it seems, was to keep his celluloid memories alive and in the American psyche in a time long past it's expiration date. So long as there's a reel and a way, Tarantino will give you a ticket to the greatest shows on earth, filled with filthy language and splattering gore violence. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is his 9th feature film. It's been announced as his second to last film. Rumor has it, if the film basks in an exponentially warm reception, this could be his last film. I pray we can all sit down one last time for the number 10, but if Quentin is seriously considering it, I'll warmly and happily accept that. The truth is, it's all been leading up to this moment. Quentin's personal crescendo, encapsulating all he has learned and all he has experienced as a man living in Hollywood and a successful filmmaker from within it. He went for it, and he did it. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is the best film of 2019, and easily his best film since Pulp Fiction. For me, nothing short of perfect. Everything I wanted it to be, and yet it still shocked and surprised me. I'm convinced that after the second and even third viewings, i'll still find new things to love about it. For nearly three hours in length, it grabs you up from your seat and never lets go.Here's the story. The year is 1969. We meet the dashing Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his frisky stuntman sidekick, Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt). The dynamic duo of black and white television, and old, gunslinging cowboy movies. They were the best, they were the most handsome and they were the most talented. They were the best actors in Hollywood.. until now. After an unkindly meeting with his agent, Marvin Schwartz (played in outrageous fashion by the great Al Pacino), Rick is told in no uncertain terms that his time as a leading man is over. In other words, he's lost everything. Reduced to playing walk-on roles in late-60's TV shows, and B-grade Italian spaghetti westerns that nobody will ever see. Devastated, he returns to sulk in his luxury home in the Hollywood hills, while Cliff goes home to a dingy trailer next-door to a drive-in movie theater, to feed his loyal pit-bull Brandy. California Dreaming is not all that it seems. But wouldn't you know it, Rick Dalton has a new neighbor. One Roman Polanksi and his wife, superstar Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie). The contrast doesn't get much starker. As Rick Dalton disappears into the hazy California sunset, Tate and friends are dancing in the middle of it. We begin to alternate between these two stories. Rick Dalton's personal misery in landing mediocre roles, and Sharon Tate humbly enjoying her career at it's peak. She's so humble, in fact, she attends screenings of her own movies in town to kick her feet back and laugh with the audience. But in the middle of the high and hard times of show business, evil lurks in the background, ready to attack. That evil being the Manson family. Cliff, Rick and Sharon all have individual run-ins with Charlie and the gang, dismissing them as your average dirty hippies, not realizing they are all about to make a head-on collision with Helter Skelter.From it's very beginning, Tarantino doesn't just show you how things were in 1969, he places you there right along with it. I was there with all of them. Many of the sequences here include interludes of driving with an authentic live radio blasting (not unlike K-Billy's Super Sounds of the 70's) the soundtrack of our film. Killer psychedelic tunes and radio ads narrate the few times where our characters stay silent, which in any Tarantino film, is brief. The first hour and a half of the film may even puzzle viewers with how little happens between the characters. But that's the point. Tarantino places the audience through multiple POVs in order to illustrate this time in Hollywood. It was a technique I didn't expect, but I adored it all the same, and if anything, I'll always remember these sequences first when I think of the film. DiCaprio lights up the screen as the manically depressed Rick Dalton who goes between arrogantly strutting on set as if he's still a hot shot, to wrecking his trailer in a fit of insecurity and rage. Brad Pitt is effortlessly cool as Cliff Booth. Dude is the suavest partner-in-crime since Paul Newman. Robbie plays Tate, and with the responsibility of playing the prime victim of one of the most gruesome and horrifying murders in American history, she needed to bring honor in this special tribute to her. Not only did she bring honor, but she also brought beauty, grace, wistful optimism and love. If she had a a song, it would probably be ""Good Morning, Starshine"", though we all know she was a Paul Revere and the Raiders fan. Tate represents here all that was good of the late 60's. That far-out, free-spirited, love your neighbor, flower power that most Californians at that time adopted.. so long as you didn't take it to the extreme. If you did, you'd turn into one of those goddamn dirty hippies.That's the other thing that Tarantino explores in 1969. If you were worried about a film about the Manson family that glorifies them as super cool anti-heroes, you best sit down and let this film do the talking. Because Tarantino clearly doesn't just hate Charles Manson, he loathes him. The man who, in his mind, killed the 1960's and the Hollywood he loved. On that note, you might be asking yourself.. this film doesn't really reenact the events of that horrible night, does it? Well, I promise you, this is a spoiler free review, but lets just say the events of August 8th 1969 don't play out here as they did in history. What results is the biggest middle finger ever given to the Manson Family in an epic finale so mindbogglingly brutal and relentless, it will make your jaw drop.I left the theater having felt like I drank a strong cocktail of Boogie Nights and Beyond the Valley of the Dolls, ripped a bong and got awakened by a punch in the face. This is a movie, and a trip and an experience you won't soon forget. See this thing, right now. See it twice. See it three times. Invite in into your head and let it stay there and stew. Explore this tapestry of Americana, booze, sex, drugs, rock' n' roll and movies. You'll be exhausted, but you will be satisfied."
167," Absolutely stunning
","I don't know how to describe what I felt during the movie, I had a constant smile for the fantastic locations, for the fantastic camera movements, the well-constructed and dynamic dialogues, and Oscar-worthy actorial performances.
It's not a movie for everyone, but if you love cinema, the art of filmmaking and storytelling, you'll love this movie.
In addition it is one of the few films that after having seen it, you think about it for days and you always want to go deeper and watch it several times.
Just wonderful."
168," Perfect
","There are few movies that I'd call perfect, but this is certainly one of them. The pacing was excellent, the expectations were appropriately subverted, the story was real, and the tone was perfectly Tarantino. I loved it."
169," One of, if not, Tarantino's best.
",It was a great movie where every minute was worth watching.
170," Absolute Perfection
","Once upon a time in Hollywood is an absolutely beautiful and immersive love letter to the summer of 69, old time Hollywood, and the magic of cinematic imagination.If Tarantino, DiCaprio And Pitt don't all get Oscars the world is unjust. As someone that is fascinated by olden day Hollywood and also a Giant Sharon Tate fan (Margot kills it, unfortunately she's not on screen a lot. When she is though, she is perfection), there is so much to be marveled at, and I won't spoil anything about it, but I'll say that I left absolutely pleased with the way that every aspect is handled.It was nearly 3 hours of living out a fantasy for a person like me, but I'm fairly certain that Tarantino also lived out something magical that he needed to get out of himself.Perhaps his most personal and diverse film, he created something entertaining and beautiful! I couldn't be happier with the outcome. This one is instantly placed into my top films list.A+"
171," A Signature Tarantino Classic
","It's so good it feels like two separate movies! After you watch it you'll remember an amazingly hilarious or stunning scene from the first act and just say ""Wow, that was the same flick?""
The cast was absolute dynamite. Led by the likes of Leonardo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt, and Margot Robbie- all three were simply electric on screen with their costars. The characters they portay, particularly DiCaprio and Pitt, were superbly likable. It was hard not to cheer at their triumphs, and not to stand in anxiety at their troubles. This movie is an absolute masterpiece from start to finish, drink in every detail; there is only 1 more Tarantino movie to go."
172," A self indulgent steaming pile
","It started with nothing and went nowhere, touched on all sorts of random tidbits and did nothing at all with any of them. Huge waste of time."
173," Pure cinema
",Pure Hollywood happy endings. A movie that's a true movie full of movie love.
174," Best movie of the year
","One of Quentin Tarantino's best,the chemistry between Brad and Leo works great with the movie"
175," Excellent.
",Excellent movie. One of Tarantino's best after Pulp Fiction. Amazing acting by all cast as well. We need more movies similar to this.
176," This masterpiece is a fantasy.
","""Once Upon A Time"" ? When was the last time you heard about this phrase ? To me, when I was little. And everytime I hear it, I know my grandfather is going to tell some very exciting tales before I go to sleep.This is one of the reasons why Tarantino named this films. No Sharon Tate murder scene, he turned the tables around, and wrote the whole historic year of 1969 again by his intelligence and knowledge of what defined Hollywood, and what Hollywood was going on at that time.Leo and Brad's performances is unbelievably outstanding. Leo played an out-dated actor in this movie for Quentin's movie. He's shown everybody how hard and tough its gonna be when you're an actor, its not just the highlights, front page of magazine, money, fame but the other side of it. Brad played a total badass, I'd take Brad for an action movie anyday rather than any actors out there nowadays. Him and his doggo was incredibly memorable in this movie.By the way, why people get mad about Bruce Lee scene ? It is Brad who is day-dreaming about what would've happened if he'd stayed with Rick at the scene. And as stuntman with such personality and talent, strong character, he'd have gone for a fight with any guy. And he day-dreamed that he would won. But in reality, we all know that Brad would not, and in a way, Bruce Lee would never harm him, he just gonna give Brad a lesson.Overall, I love the ending. That's all we wish that should've happened in real life. I hope Sharon and her child in the heaven watch this smiling.
Perfect ""Once Upon A Time"" in Hollywood.Thank you, Mr. Tarantino."
177," Requires Multiple Viewing
","I had seen the trailer to Once Upon a Time..in Hollywood and was sure I would like it and was sure it would be more of the typical Tarantino offering. I came away totally confused. While it had some of the usual QT trademarks - the killer soundtrack, the attention to detail, the multiple story lines, - it had something more, I just wasn't sure what it was. I did like the film but probably wouldn't have put it next to his greatest work. But there were things that keep coming back to me in the following days, a kind of delayed realization of certain scenes and dialogue, what the movie was trying to say. I was already loving it more and knew I'd have to rewatch it. So today I went and saw it again and I have to say, this may well be one of the finest movies I've ever seen. It's a 10, a masterpiece in every sense of the word. The writing, the casting, the soundtrack, the cinematography - all flawless - and I haven't even mentioned the acting! It's a very emotional film, it is funny, heartbreaking, deep, it's a beautiful homage to everything movies can be. This is a classic for the ages."
178," Sit back and enjoy
","This film is definitely a love letter to Hollywood of the late 60's. I was born about the same time as the film takes place. I remember so many of the little things in the picture, as most were still around to the mid 70's. A younger person will not get the same enjoyment as someone my age, but by 17 year old son also enjoyed the film. This is not really comparable to the storyline of any other Tarantino film but it is clearly one of his films."
179," Amazing
",From places in movie to performances truly a gem Leonardo is Oscar worthy!
180," An awesome look at Hollywood in 1969
","Set in Hollywood in 1969, once great star Rick Dalton(Leonardo DiCaprio) feels he is now has been, cause good roles are not coming his way, stuck doing minor roles in TV shows, his comfort is his stunt double and good friend Cliff Booth(Brad Pitt), who sticks by him through out, but in Hollywood not everything is all glamour.
Quentin Tarantino has done it again, with his incredible directing and storytelling, and the way he makes the scenery of 1969 become a character itself. Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert Redford really have a good Paul Newman and Robert Redford like chemistry to there characters, you instantly buy there history and friendship. Margot Robbie does shine as Sharon Tate, even though she has little bit to do, she comes through when she comes on screen. If you are expecting this film to be accurate of how certain events took place in that decade, you gotta to know that Tarantino likes to play fast and loose with that, and I'm glad cause it kept me on the edge of my seat. Nicohlas Hammond(The Sound of Music, Spider-Man) does chew up the scenery in a cameo has director Sam Wannamaker. R.I.P. Luke Perry who also makes a cameo. My only complaint is there a sub plot about Brad Pitts character, that never really gets answered, maybe that was the point, but that is minor. I still liked it, it's a great homage to Hollywood in 1969."
181," A piece of art.
","I thought this movie was amazing. The cast had amazing chemistry and this was another very creative idea straight out of Quentin's mind. Although, this movie is not for everyone. I feel like after people see the movie it's either they love it or they don't. Sometimes it's like that for other Tarantino movies as well. In my opinion, I loved this film and I thought they did a phenomenal job. That's just my opinion though. It all really just depends on the type of person that's watching the movie."
182," One of Tarantino's best!
","I have not much to say except for this may be one of Tarantino's best films of all time. Yes, there were a few slow parts but that doesn't make the film any less amazing. Great characters, awesome plot points, a hilarious yet brutal final scene with a plot twist that we didn't expect. It's perfect!"
183," best tarantino movie after pulp fiction
","This movie is insane, leonardo dicaprio and brad pitt are outstanding. the scenes where cliff booth (brad pitt) is driving and the music is playing is well done. the ending is super satisfying and the long runtime is worth it, this movie never got boring at any part"

",Amazing! Absolutely brilliant from start to finish. I didn't know what to expect and I was blown away
185," His Most Beautifully Told Story With The Most Tarantino Trademarks
","I have to say right off the bat, I really enjoyed this movie. It was not in your face like Pulp Fiction; it was not streamlined to a story like ReservoirDogs and Jackie Brown; it was not heavy with action like Kill Bill 1/2. However, it is a period piece like his last three movies, The Hateuful Eight, Django Unchained, and Inglorious Basterds.It is a beautifully told story which allows the exploration of alternate timelines (he has done the before in Inglorious Bastards). It does tend to form as a story slower than most of his writings, but it is a story which needs to be told at this pace.Many classic movies in history follow the same pace. I think this is why he used this type of storytelling. He is comparing classic movies of culture; the timeless storytelling moviegoers were used to many years ago.What I liked the most about this movie is QT purposely integrated his classic fashionable trademarks within to ensure everyone knows this is a powerful story told only the way he knows how. He used his trademark of showing feet more in this movie than any other. In all of his movies those feet are always attached to incredibly beautiful women (one exception is Carradine in KB II). I think he may be doing this to show his feelings about Hollywood and this era.Also, just to let you know, when you see this, make sure to stay through the credits. There is a scene to see.Hats off to you Mr. Tarintino for this beautiful piece of storytelling. Take a bow sir! Encore, Encore!"
186," One of the best movies I've ever seen!
",So nostalgic and very verbally and visually appealing. One of the best endings ever! I will go see it again.
187," Movie of the year
",This is hands down the greatest movie of 2019. The acting was outstanding brad Pitt will win an Oscar for his role in this movie that's how great he was
188," ""Once Upon A Time In Hollywood"" is a cinematic masterpiece.
","There hasn't been a movie-going experience like ""Once Upon A Time In Hollywood"" in many years. An epic love letter to everything Hollywood that only Tarantino could helm. A flat-out masterpiece.In this dark comedy-drama, a faded television actor and his stunt double strive to achieve fame and success in the film industry in 1969 Los Angeles.Writer/director Quentin Tarantino's attention to detail has always been one of his many trademarks, but in ""Once Upon A Time... In Hollywood"" his focus never steers away from capturing the essence of 1969 Los Angeles. DiCaprio and Pitt are a match made in heaven; their performances are some of the best of their careers, respectively. Margot Robbie is sensational as Sharon Tate and really capturing her aura. The film altogether is Tarantino's magnum opus and if this is his final original film, he knocked it out of the park. ""Once Upon A Time... In Hollywood"" is the best film I've seen this year and I can't wait to see it again.Do not miss this film."
189," Tarantino = Awesomeness
","The first hint that Once Upon A Time...In Hollywood is a more wistful film than it may appear is in its title. Starting with the magic words that mark the opening of a fairy tale, followed by the bridge of a pensive ellipsis, the title evokes the empty, bone-deep ache that underlies all nostalgia, a longing for a half-remembered moment in time that may never have really existed at all. If any contemporary film director's work stands up to such a granular reading, it's Quentin Tarantino's; in this film, as in all his others, he breaks down a place and time-in this case, Hollywood, 1969- and rebuilds it in his own movie-obsessed image, each deliberately placed poster and casually dropped reference one piece of a cryptic puzzle. Here, however, the writer-director's own yearnings and anxieties are closer to the surface than usual.This is Tarantino's most personal film in decades, and the longings expressed in it flow from who he is as a person: an established middle-aged white guy confronting his own impending irrelevance. That exact prospect eats away at the film's protagonist, Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio), a fading Western TV star whose diminishing celebrity has forced him to contemplate the unthinkable for an actor of his caliber: going to Rome to star in ""Eye-talian"" Westerns. Rick still lives the lifestyle of a man in his 20s, but now those blotto nights alone in his Hollywood bachelor pad leave him hungover, melancholy, and unable to remember his lines on the set of whatever B-grade TV show he's guest starring on that week.Rick's most lasting relationship has been with his stuntman/driver/chief enabler, Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt), whose reckless driving betrays a dangerous violent streak underneath his bright Hawaiian shirts and cocky comebacks. Rick and Cliff are openly contemptuous of hippies-DiCaprio, puffy and red-faced, screams at a car full of them wearing a half-open bathrobe and clutching a pitcher of margaritas at one point-and of Mexican people. Their conservative crankiness is a clear reflection of their insecurity about their place in a rapidly changing film industry (and world); it's an unflattering aspect of their personalities that's reflected in DiCaprio's vulnerable, admirably pathetic performance as the past-his-prime Rick.Tarantino's longtime editor, Sally Menke, died in 2010, and her absence is still palpable. But though Menke's assistant, Fred Raskin, stumbled with Django Unchained, he comes into his own with Once Upon A Time, indulging in high-wire experiments that further unmoor the film from conventional plotting. Entire sequences are cut in as flashbacks mid-scene, as when Cliff's idle remembrance of Rick's comment about him knowing better than to ask stunt coordinator Randy (Russell) for work leads to an extended scene of Cliff picking a fight with Bruce Lee-and, quite improbably, winning. (If, indeed, that's what really happened; in a movie obsessed with image and memory, Cliff may not be the most reliable of narrators.) But the Arrested Development of it all is most acutely felt in the conversations about Rick Dalton and his filmography, scenes heavily seasoned with quippy cutaways to footage of DiCaprio in fictional movies like The 14 Fists Of McLusky and Operazione Dy-no-mite!, alongside actual '60s classics like The Great Escape.The moment that gives us perhaps the clearest view of Once Upon A Time's complicated relationship with fame and a life lived through pop culture comes midway through the film, as Rick struggles through a scene opposite a younger cowboy star (Timothy Olyphant) on the latter's Western series. We know that we're watching the TV show within the film because DiCaprio's repeating dialogue we watched him practice earlier. But the scene is shot in the same aspect ratio and cut with the same rhythm as the larger film itself. We see neither crew nor cameras, and the only indication that this isn't ""really"" happening are voices offscreen feeding Rick/DiCaprio his lines-that is, until Rick nails the scene. Suddenly, the spell is broken, the camera pulls back, and the director, crew, and equipment all appear on the sidelines. For Rick-and, one assumes, for Tarantino-movies (or, in this case, TV) and life have become interchangeable, and failing at one essentially obliterates the other. What will both of them do, Once Upon A Time... In Hollywood wonders, when their moments of triumph are gone?"
190," Boring and disappointing
","Waited for the story to begin but that never happened. Total let down. Extremely lengthy, unnecessary scenes."
191," I heard the original cut was 4 hours long
","I could have sat through more of that, every shot was so strategic and perfectly thought out. Definitely my favorite Tarentino film."
192," The Ending Was Satisfying
","For those who were so bored, Spiderman is still playing.For the adults in the room who remember not only the seventies but the horrific Tate-LaBianca murders by idiots with no ability to actually think for themselves, the what if ending was tremendously satisfying.Brad Pitt and DiCaprio were having a ball. The actress (she was DiCaprio's wife in The Wolf of Wall Street) who played Sharon Tate really calories the personna of Tate, who by many accounts was a lovely, sweet person.I saw this movie on a beautiful Saturday afternoon at 12:15 and the movie theater was packed. Great story, great acting all around, great real actor portrayals, and a satisfying, if only, ending.Oh, and don't forget the dog!"
193," OMG this is so boring
",I love Quentin movies. Hateful eight is probably my favourite and was looking forward to what I assumed was going to be another classic. I was wrong.I get that this is playing homage to the 60s film era but its so boring...There just isn't a story... Leonardo looks dashing as usual and maggot looks beautiful but that's about it...I've seen more in depth stories on QVC...
194," So boring I had to leave the cinema
","I've seen the other ""Once upon a time"" films. The ""West"" was good. The ""America"" I found too long and boring. Every scene dragged out way to the point of annoyance.Same with this ""Hollywood"" version now directed by Quentin Tarantino;
It seems the entire movie is a documentary of details and recreation of how it looked back in those days. That is fine, but don't forget you are filming a movie. Not adapting a book that has to describe how everything looks, how a person walks, and how the methodically smoke their cigarette.
That is boring to watch and is not driving the story.So after 1 1/2 hour and the movie still doesn't make me care for the characters or what the point of the movie is, making me sit in my chair yawning and still wondering what the plot is, me and my date also agree to go as I saw she was bored as hell.
Several other people in the cinema had left before us too.So I am wondering what all the praise for this bore fest is?
I might watch it again later on other means just to see the ending.
A day I am bored and have nothing else to do."
195," An Overrated Boring And Long Film
","No question that a combination of Quentin Tarantino and two of the biggest actors in Hollywood - Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt - are receiving enormous hype especially from fans of all three who expected a great film from them.Apparently,that is what many have not seen but refused to admit.""Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood"" has a zigzagging plot, empty dialogues,confusing subtleties, and a poor nostalgic effect especially when it tries to tells the story of Hollywood in the 1960's represented by Rick Dalton and Cliff Booth as well as their day-to-day life. It tries to bring back the viewer during that era when Hollywood was losing its innocence due to the numerous changes that are happening.Added to that story is Sharon Tate.Too bad that Tarantino once again tries to apply some thematic elements in her story which he did in his previous films. But it does not work this time. While it was evident that he is trying to present a ""new"" picture of Charlie Manson and Sharon Tate,it was apparent that the viewer is not concerned very much about them as it tells the story of Dalton and Booth. What is even worse is that the narrative was presented in a confusing manner. And what about the scene involving Bruce Lee?What is Tarantino trying to do?Overall,it was not a well-made movie. Tarantino pushed his luck too far with it and some viewers even felt that he created a ""genius"" of a film.But in the end,it was a long,boring and overrated movie."
196," Best Tarantino Film So Far!
","I love mostly all of Tarantino's films, but Jackie Brown & Once Upon A Time in Hollywood are my favorites! I love these 2 films the most because they're different from all of the other Tarantino films. I'd put (Let's hope for a Volume 3) Kill Bill Volume 2 after Jackie Brown in my favorites. Pulp Fiction is great, but isn't my number 1 favorite. Django Unchained felt too long, Death Proof is okay. Inglourious Basterds is a masterpiece, and one of the greatest films last decade. Not every Tarantiono film is for everyone, including for fans. If you don't like his Jackie Brown kind of style of his films and more Kill Bill, you might be a bit dissapointed. This is my favorite Tarantino film because of it's rich storytelling, outstanding acting, smart dialogue, beautiful cinematography, and great soundtrack. I love the ending, and is my favorite Tarantino ending, and one of my favorite endings of all time. I loved every moment of this movie when I saw it, and was a breath of fresh air after the bad The Hateful Eight. If you like Tarantino's Jackie Brown style, you'll love this movie! My favorite movie of the year so far!"
197," Just needed one more small thing to happen and it'd be a 10
","Those last 10 minutes.... holy cow! About as satisfying an ending QT has conceived, rivaling Inglorious Basterds. But those waning moments aside, this movie was absolutely hysterical. Leo's self-loathing diatribes were comedy gold. Brad Pitt's mannerisms and delivery of his lines rivals his genius portrayal of Aldo Raine in Inglorious Basterds.Now it's a revenge fantasy, so you know QT took some creative liberties with the Manson Family saga in the late 60s, but here is one thing that was missing: a satisfying death of the ring leader himself, Charles Manson. I understand the 3 involved at the end of the film we're actually the 3 who murdered Sharon Tate and her friends, but can you imagine if Charles Manson decides himself to show up to Rick's house only to meet Cliff, Brandy, and Rick, fresh from taking names (no you're name was dumber than that... classic line!)? That would've made this a 10. However, this movie was as good as it gets. Well done QT for not caring what the PC culture says and being you, you made a gem. Last word, give Leo and QT the oscars, because both give their best performances to date, but Brad Pitt stoke the show. Amazing movie, can't wait to see it again!"
198," Leonardo Dicaprio Deserves an Oscar for this role
","I don't like to write reviews about anything I watch on TV or on big screen, but after I watched Once upon time in hollywood starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt and directed by the magnificent Quentin Tarantino, I was really amazed by the performance of Leo he really deserves the oscar for this role, I was about to give up my dream and accept the reality that I've been forced to live it unwillingly but after I saw this scene where everyone was praising Rick Dilton ""played by Leonardo"" and seeing him crying it teased me and I said when this will happen to me?
Anyway the whole production was really amazing and I was really mesmerised with the picture and with the performance, they took me to that era where everything was simple and hard at the same time.
I literally lived every moment and I didn't get bored or yawn like I did with most movies I watched lately.
It deserves your time so watch it please..."
199," A sincere love story
","This movie was beyond my expectations. It was a warm, sincere love story between QT and all that was genuinely incredible about Hollywood and the magic that was created during the 'Golden Age'. The story line between the two leads was a wonderful thread woven into a great narrative and very well crafted. The emotional end was the outcome we would all wish for - but the ugly face of reality was present - but dealt with in a way that should have been the reality. QT is a master story teller and his dream of this beautiful fairy tale is one where we can honestly say ' they lived happily ever after...'"
200," Tarantino has done it again!!! Masterpiece
","Tarantino delivers an incredible movie with its own genre/style! He creates a perfect image of the 60s! Also has great acting from Leo, Brad, and Margot! I think it is better than pulp fiction now! Very fun film!!! Please go see this! You won't regret it!"
201," One of the Greatest Endings I've Ever Seen
","Tarantino, Pitt, and DiCaprio completely outdid themselves."
202," AMAZING movie - another Tarantino masterpiece
","Ok, full disclosure - I'm a huge QT fan, and have seen everything he's ever directed or produced.This movie is one of his absolute BEST, hands down. It rivals Pulp Fiction in my opinion. I really love the way Tarantino takes occasional liberties with actual history (like in Inglorious Basterds, where Hitler met a different fate than suicide in a bunker). The little girl in this movie is a genius - just watch her career take off. Dakota Fanning had a similar meteoric rise, and she's even in this movie as well. The cast is incredible - the cinematography and performances are insane. I'm going to the theater again this weekend to watch it a second time."
203," Tarantino's best since Pulp Fiction
","First of all I'll just say, what a ride. The first viewing it really is a lot to take in, but the second viewing I knew what I was in for and it was even better paying attention to all of the little details. I'm 24 and actually had no idea about Sharon Tate (I had heard of her, I just didn't know what happened to her). So I feel this almost made the experience better for me the first time because I had very little expectations as to what may happen.I disagree with some people saying that younger generations won't enjoy it because it's set in the late 60's. Really, if you know the basics of what was going on at that time and are a Tarantino fan and/or a film lover, you should definitely enjoy this movie. Also, people saying it doesn't have a plot are missing the point. It's meant to be a fantasy and homage to that time period in and around Hollywood. It actually does have multiple plots, they are just hard to recognize because they are hidden behind many of Tarantino's little quirks. Essentially, it's about an actor hitting a speed bump in his career and not knowing what's next for him. And also his stunt double and confidant who inadvertently gets involved with the Manson ""family"". All while living next door to Sharon Tate.Really, everything is damn near perfect; namely the acting, writing and cinematography. The music, as always with Tarantino, was excellent. It is perhaps one of Tarantino's funniest movies too. Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt are both brilliant. I'm still having a difficult time deciding who was better. Probably Leo in terms of his intense acting, but Brad was as cool as ever and probably the more memorable character. Margot Robbie does an excellent job of portraying Sharon Tate and her innocence as well. Tarantino gets the very best out of all the supporting actors. Every single actor, whether in a minor role or not, definitely brought their A-game.Even if you feel like you wouldn't like the movie, I still think it's one that everyone should go and see anyway. If you don't like it, then that's fine. I just feel it brings you back to a time and place that we can all kind of relate to and appreciate in one way or another. Of course many people will be put off by its length and for being ""slow"" and self-indulgent. But for being the film it is, I feel those are almost positives because of the way Tarantino presents it. Definitely don't expect a bunch of action and violence like most of his films. The ending (which is amazing) and a few other moments aside, it's really one of his least violent movies. Also, it is maybe one his most mature films, perhaps right after Jackie Brown. Overall, it sort of has a little bit of all of his previous work bunched into it, which is probably another reason I loved it so much. It doesn't quite surpass ""Pulp Fiction"" for me, but it may just be the closest Tarantino gets to doing so."
204," Once upon a time in Hollywood
",Once upon a time in Hollywood is a masterpiece unlike any other masterpiece. The way the movie was filmed was perfection. The acting was on point. It was just a fantastic movie.
205," Love Letter to Hollywood
","Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood"" is an incredible love letter to the Hollywood of the 1960s, the magic of movie making, bromances, the golden glow of youth, the less shiny struggle of aging, Brad Pitt's ageless beauty, almost pathological attention to detail, and the deliciousness of great, messy slasher films. Such a unique idea and so beautifully made. I loved it. I really hope Quentin is lying about retiring, but this would be a pretty great one to go out on."
206," Quentin Tarantino does it again..
","Quentin Tarantino does it again. This time enlisting Leonardo DiCaprio for a bigger role than he previously had in Django Unchained. The other main character is played by Brad Pitt who has worked with Tarantino in the past on True Romance and Inglorious Basterds. If I was to say that these two stars were absolutely incredible it would be an understatement. Yes they are huge stars but that doesn't mean they will automatically fit any role or perform highly. They both were perfect in their respective roles. The characters Rick Dalton and Cliff Booth are both portrayed amazingly by Leo and Brad. There is also a handful of other amazing actors and actresses in this movie. I loved the set pieces and design. The movie felt like a look right into the past but in a fun crazy ""Tarantino"" style. I had a blast seeing it in the theater and I would recommend it to any fan of these actors just to see their performances alone. Also for any fans of Quentin Tarantino it is a must see. I personally loved it and I would give it a 10. Side note Margot Robbie, Margaret Qualley, Al Pacino, Dakota Fanning, Bruce Dern, Emile Hirsch, Kurt Russel, Luke Perry.. ect all did an amazing job as well! Don't forget that and many other side characters such as the actor who plays Bruce Lee he we great. Overall 10/10 for me I had a great experience with this one."
207," Interesting story, great dialog, excellent character development
",I'm a fan of Tarantino's movies starting with Pulp Fiction. This movie is one of his best. I particularly enjoyed the performances by Pitt and Dicaprio. The supporting case were also excellent. I hope Tarantino's releases a longer cut in a few years. Highly recommended.
208," Brilliant!
","If you settle in and appreciate this film for how well made it is, the run time flys by and the ending is amazing! The acting, direction and writing is incredible. Going back to see it again tonight!"
209," If Only It Was True.......
","Outstanding film with great acting by all involved; definetly some best acting Oscar nominations in the near future. Bruce Dern has a small part, but is so natural in it, that he briefly steals the film. If only the ending really happened........"
210," Tarantino has created one of the greatest films ever made
","OUATIH has cemented Tarantino for the 9th time as one of the greatest writers/directors of our time and this might be his best film to date, or at least his most mature"
211," Almost up there with Pulp Fiction
","I expected an amazing, 3 Hour experience, and that is what was delivered. The screenplay was unique, funny, etc. There is some stellar acting and Leo and Brad Pitt deserve Oscar nods. And the climax is surprising and exciting and it leaves you on your feet for a solid 15-20 minutes. This slow paced, but interesting story was very fun for me and I definitely recommend this movie to anybody who loves Oscar movies and to anybody who is able to be patient and just enjoys movies as a whole."
212," Masterpiece
","After seeing it twice, I'm just going to say everything about this film was perfect. This is why I'm obsessed with cinema and Tarantino. The runtime is nearly three hours, but when the credits rolled, I just wanted it to keep going another five. Not one second of boredom. The attention to detail from Quentin is just insane. From the neon signs, the music, the costumes, the and the buildings, it's like I was living in 1969 Los Angeles with the characters. And, there is no one, and I mean NO ONE who does music better than Quentin Tarantino. The guy hits a grand slam every time. Brad Pitt and Leo both give top 3 performances in their careers IMO. And will The Academy give Brad Pitt his damn Oscar already, please?"
213," Possibly the best acting I've ever seen in a film
","I kid you not the acting in this film was incredible. Brad Pitt being the standout star for me personally he sells his character so well I almost forgot that it was Brad Pitt I was watching. DiCaprio does just as well of course. It shows a films quality when you have two amazing actors, you could argue some of the best ever, each actor has so many amazing films yet this one still can compete with those amazing titles. The movie does definitely feel like an almost three hour movie but that dident bother me enough to drop it to a nine. the atmosphere of the movie is also spot on making you feel like your in the 60s again. The climax of the film is so funny and Tarantino like (fans of his work will know what I mean) Overall this film might be Quintin Tarantino best masterpiece. And that means a lot when Tarantino has so many top of the industry films."
214," Open your mind and enjoy the art
","Great flick... a film that's starts at a slow burn and finishes an inferno. Great acting, great cinematography and a film that makes you want to read about the real life people portrayed in the film."
215," Better the second time.
","Once you already know the ending, I found the details of the film fascinating."
216," Tarantino is simply the best!
","Like Inglourious Basterds, here's yet another brilliant twist on real and super sad events. Brilliant writing and directing. Oscar winner for sure!"
217," 10/10
","Upon a third viewing of Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood, to my surprise, I was still in this rhapsodic state similar to opening night. The movie has well-crafted characters, fictional and non, that make it easy to fall in-love with this semi imaginative world that's splendiferous. My knowledge of cinema/music was stretched and it was really nice seeing Quentin geek out with the references. I particularly felt drawn to the Hullabaloo scene which was choreographed to a tee (Leo sings better than he thinks). Brad's humor reminds of his performance in ""Burn After Reading"". Albeit the outrage of Bruce's depiction would make you think it was demeaning, Quentin wrote one of the best lines & directed his best shot of his career that being Lee's ""My hands are registered as lethal weapons..."" bit. Manson's one scene was menacing enough & I'm glad Tarantino didn't add more. Almost teared up when ""Out Of Time"" came on and propelled the transition Rick has, the lights of restaurants one-by-one turning on, as well as Sharon being beautifully honored. ""Twelve Thirty"" serves as a great transition song too, making me more emotionally invested in the story. Also, Mikey Madison was a standout to me in the final action sequence, pig impressions and all. The ending climax brought the same feelings akin to that of Basterds & Django. Phenomenal writing. Possibly my favorite film ever & I'm glad other people share the same sentiments. Now, hopefully, come award season everyone who worked on this masterpiece will be rewarded. I'll be seeing this once more in September just for good measure because you wouldn't look at the Mona Lisa just once, right? My love for it is immeasurable. Lastly, I think this quote by Sam Shepard captures the ending Quentin crafted for Rick, ""The most authentic endings are the ones which are already revolving towards another beginning."" His love-letter was delivered, his Magnum Opus for sure. Need I say more?"
218," He's done it again, folks!
",What a stunning movie! I could not have hoped for a better outcome. (No spoiler alert!) True Tarantino to give us much more than we could have hoped for and then some. Stunning period piece.
219," Must See Many Times
","This is without a doubt the Best Picture of the Year. Not only because it will deserve it, but just like Green Book last year they have nailed the MARKETING for the Film . Only thing, I recommend that your Butt hits the chair at the theatre right before the Movie Starts. Although I appreciate the Trailers for upcoming Films as much as the next Guy, with a 2 hour and 41 minute Movie, need to be Fresh ? Maybe they should have a quick intermission ? So, Unless a International Indy Film comes out that is Fabulous before Oscars time, or someone does something Stupid to ruin it, this Film will prevail . Also Hats off to Kurt Russell on the Voice Over.
I will be rooting for Quentin Tarantino, the Lead Actors and Team, bound to be up for some Oscars as well as the Fabulous Soundtrack !"
220," The Best Movie of 2019
","So nice to see a film that ignores all the current movie tropes and just makes a fantastic movie with an all-star cast. This is Tarantino's Sunset Blvd except with a happy ending, and what an ending!"
221," Very cleverly done, well done Mr T! (spoilers)
","As most reviews stated its not a typical Tarantino. While watching i didn't know the real back story at all, which does leave you confused. I had to go home after and read what actually happened. and the more i think about it the better the film gets. Giving an alternate ending to a real life gory horror was Tarantino's ultimate twist. the real story is the horror and he changed it. For people that want to analyse i film and its director you can go into quite some depth here.The acting was superb, Pitt and Dicaprio did an amazing job, though slow in places they set off the characters perfectly. It shows the era fantastically and its all been followed through very well.Don't see this just to see the the latest Tarantino film, see it in its own right."
222," Tarantino only makes bangers
","Straight up, brad Pitt and Leo put on some of the best acting you will ever see in film. This movie is typical Tarantino and will be a classic in years to come."
223," A 60s nostalgic slow burn with all the Tarantino magic fans know and love.
","Amazing recreation of classic Tinseltown (and surrounding areas) a glorious but turbulent city, with fame and fortune, heartbreak and misery. It's classic Hollywood with a dark side. Don't expect a 100% factual representation of the story, Tarantino took creative license and as a Tarantino fan (and Angeleno) I can't recommend this movie enough, you will not be disappointed.For those who can't stomach violence, disapprove of jokes regarding racial & gender stereotypes, I would not recommend this movie."
224," Why I love Tarantino!!!! And this film!!
","I am probably not going to say anything anyone else hasn't said, but this movie is the reason Tarantino is one of our most valued directors of our time. His theory of filmmaking is evident in all films - he is the the quintessential story teller. He takes his time with his film to tell a story, a probable story. My husband thought the ending of this film was a slap in the face to the victims. However, had we known who Charlie and his gang were capable of, wouldnt we all love the ending the film gave us? The same with Inglorious Basterds. Who wouldnt love to carve a swastika in a Nazi officer's forehead, on his way to ""living the American dream""? Or to kill Hitler in a theater instead of his cowardly way out? A slave seeking rescue and revenge to save his wife? While the violence was pretty briefly brutal at the end, the storytelling, set direction, actors, cinematography...all of it make for a compelling, amazing, what could have been film. Though I was born in 1974, the Manson family, the era of 1969 Hollywood/LA, and the ebb and tide of cultural change taking place in the film industry, resonates with me still to this day, as this film definitely did. Excellent work, Tarantino. In case your read this, you are a reason to go to the movies!!!"
225," Nostalgic Yet Fresh
","I must admit I have not thoroughly enjoyed a Tarantino movie since Kill Bill so I approached Once Upon a Time in Hollywood with equal parts hope and hesitation. Not to say any of his movies are bad, far from it, they all have merit. It's just that I feel a lot of the modern Tarantino movies have been so over the top, polished, and indulgent that they almost become parodies of themselves. I prefer his more measured and rough around the edges freshman efforts. But my oh my, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood was an absolute delight, and despite all the pretense with which I approached it, it felt like a breath of fresh air.The movies plays out like a fictionalized historical piece about a very specific, very late 60s moment in American history. Woven in with the star-studded and morbid tale of Sharon Tate is a fading macho Hollywood front man and his almost super humanly capable stunt double. There characters are both firmly rooted in the nostalgia of the era while bringing some sense of realism by portraying the turpitude that likely would accompany the lives of people who may appear immortally cool on the big screen. Rick Dalton is deeply insecure about his acting abilities to the point of almost breaking down at the sign of his career descending, a far cry from the calm and collected presence he assumes when in character on set. His stunt double Cliff lives in a rundown trailer, probably killed his wife, and his combative personality has prevented him from achieving and true success. We like these characters but their flaws are out there for all to see and it paints them apart from the traditionally Hollywood protagonist but not to the point of become a more played out anti-hero archetype.It also is no accident that they always seem to be driving against the arrows on the road, coughing while chain smoking, and drinking excessively to the point where their livers must look worse than their hangovers feel. They are physical embodiments of the era of fame and excess, but additionally they act as audience inserts into the real and horrifying story of Sharon Tate, which Tarantino weaves into the background with a great performance of innocent Hollywood love and kindness from Robbie. Perhaps most impressively is the fact that the story of Rick Dalton and Sharon Tate intertwine so seamlessly and despite its almost three hour runtime the movie never real drags or speeds to its conclusion. The construction is not as unique as some of his other works but it manages to feel fresh for a director so established, which really did impress me.So we have this movie made about this nostalgic yet dangerous time in Californian history in the actual style of a nostalgic and warm movie from that era. It's a 60s Hollywood movie about Hollywood from the perspective of a fan living in 2019 if you will. It feels like an all too familiar dreamland, on the edge of parody, and as such it achieves some truly humorous moments with a little biting social commentary sprinkled in. And in old Hollywood fashion by the end of the film the heroes are heroes and the heavies are the heavies. Absent violence it is not, but it does not indulge to the fanatical excesses of his previous work. It is markedly mature. I anticipated a far more gory and dark ending, a possible condemnation of the romanticized Hollywood of the past, but it ended far more subtly (and in my opinion properly). The final scene had me on the edge of my seat and then in stitches and was probably my favorite in the whole film.DiCaprio and Pitt are just perfectly cast. I cannot think of a single criticism of there work here. In particular the scenes where DiCaprio plays Dalton playing a villain on the set of a western impressed me greatly. Not that he needs validation from me but he is a real talent. I am also not sure how anyone could doubt the ability of Robbie at this point in her career, here she gives a life to the role of Sharon Tate that was sorely needed. It added gravity and a sense of stakes to the ending sequence. And what can I say about Pitt, he oozes cool to the point where you actually believe he could kick Bruce Lee's ass.With Once Upon a Time in Hollywood Tarantino has solidified his already towering mark on modern film, while at the same time sending a love letter to the Hollywood of yesteryear, the town that has given him so much. Like Tate in the theater watching her own movie, you can feel the joy and love he gets from working on his craft, and that passion has garnered his movies rightful praise. I love Los Angeles, I love the movies, and I love this one in particular, it's far from flawless but in my eyes it is a 10/10."
226," Best of 2019 so far
","The 9th film by Quentin Tarantino
Once upon a time in Hollywood seems to be Tarantino's most mature, laid back and easy going film. And I mean maturity as in the maturity of Tarantino as a filmmaker. This is very different than every other film of his, it doesn't rely on shock value (until the end anyway), it doesn't have super hardcore violence for the most part, it also doesn't have high tension sequences that we've come to expect from Tarantino, but that's doesn't disappoint you because that high tension galore isn't needed here. It's a comedy about two friends. A fading actor and his stuntman in the aftermath of the golden age of cinema, trying to fit in, in a rapidly changing industry. What I love about this is Tarantino's love for filmmaking, films and the experience of going to the cinema is oozing in this. You can just tell he LOVES what he does and he LOVES going to the movies. The ""quirky"" kind of tone, the witty, fantastic dialogue is all still there and it is top tier Tarantino. The performances from Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio are incredible, such great chemistry, they elevate the film in every scene they are together, Margot Robbie plays Sharon Tate beautifully. And she did a great job respectfully portraying an actress who was murdered tragically. My biggest gripe with the film is that Tarantino didn't use any of his signature high tension, downright uncomfortable sequences regarding the Manson cult. I would've liked to experiences that eeriness when he introduced us to the cult in the film, but he just brushed it off. Other than that the film is incredible artistic, stylized; the soundtrack is amazing, it works incredible well while cliff booth is driving around the night time in LA. It sets the mood perfectly. This is also gonna be one of, if not THE most rewatchable film Tarantino has ever made. Just great. I loved it so much, and I suspect I'll love it even more as time goes on. It's incredible Tarantino made a film with almost no structured narrative and you still come out of it thinking ""that was fantastic"" ; the last shot of the film is so beautiful, and kind of sad if you read up on the Sharon Tate murder. I loved Tarantino's twist to what happened, it made me wish that only if that had what happened in real life :("
227," People giving this a 10, 9, 8 like movies with no plot!
",Quentin Tarantino thinks he can just put any old rubbish out and the public will watch! Yes they will Quentin but only because of your old movies.. This movie to me was nothing! meant nothing! did nothing! I would add spoilers in my review but there weren't any! Seriously where is your head at Quentin? Maybe i'm completely missing the point of this movie but to me it was just a nostalgia piece of movie making.
228," Ummm....
",I have watched most of Tarantino's movies. I respect his style of storytelling and consider him a talent. In my humble opinion I thought this one was just okay.
229," Tarantino is a genius when it comes to making incredible movies.
","One of the best crafted movies I've ever seen. Tarantino is brilliant. I love all his movies, but this one is special- everything comes together just right in this one. You feel transported back to the time of 1969, so different than today. Awesome acting, music, everything. There are only a few tiny things that ticked me off, but could easily be overlooked by the greatness of the whole film. I'm speaking of the wrongly cast and poor acting of Zoe Bell, who, just like in the Hateful Eight, stood out in a bad way. Tarantino certainly is loyal to her, but he should make her take a ton of acting classes so she doesn't stick out like a sore thumb. Also, like the Hateful Eight, my absolute personal favorite of Tarantino's films, there is an irritating narration done to quickly get through a certain section of the movie. This time its Kurt Russell. Since Tarantino felt another narration was needed (which I don't), he at least could have used the groveled cowboy voice of Sam Elliot. That would've fit better, but the narrations just don't work in my opinion. Everyone knows Quentin Tarantino films contain an excessive amount of f-bombs, which suits his style just fine, but I'd love to know how many times it was said in this one because it had to of broken a Guinness world record. Anyway, great movie- Pitt's character was something else. It did bother me they said he killed his wife though, which was quite believable after watching his power and violence with everyone else. Poor Bruce Lee. Margot Robbie was beautiful, and Leonardo DiCaprio's acting was stellar. Everyone should be smart and see this movie; just, remember it is a Quentin Tarantino masterpiece, so you know the language and bloody violence is going to be............AWESOME. See it!"
230," Really enjoyed the movie
",Me and my buddy big Dave saw the flick and thought it was great. Big Dave loves Leo while I was more on Mr Pitt's side. Well done Mr Terroni.
231," Wouldn't be an LA movie without half of it in a car
","This film was amazing. All the characters were unique, dialog felt real and natural, and the pacing was perfect. I'm not the hugest Tarantino fan, but damned if this movie didn't nail it on all fronts. 👍"
232," The King is Naked
","This movie is a snooze fest.
You have two of three good things about a movie, ergo excellent actors and good directing, but the third thing - the script is all over the place.Let me ask you something.. what was this movie about? Is it about Charles Manson, is it about Rick Dalton, is it about the 60's way of an actor's life?
It has no drive, no real point.Sharon Tate's character is just meaningless... you have pointless walking around with close to no lines at all in the whole movie. All that time you're waiting for some interaction between the protagonists and her character, which... basically never happens.You have the scene with Manson... which is so out of place... with no backstory, no nothing.. if you have zero knowledge about the matter it's just some dude and that's it.You have the Bruce Lee scene, which is just... I don't even have words to describe it. He's portrayed by the worst possible way (no idea why) and you have Tarantino defending the credibility of the scene by saying that Cliff is a war hero and he's a warrior. Really? Bruce Lee.. the MMA founder in a way... losing a fight to a regular Joe, even if he's military trained...
And the arrogance is just... a misunderstood confidence.The hippie camp-ranch is the only scene in the movie, that provides any real wondering, suspense and actual care about a character in the film.If that wasn't a Tarantino movie and it wasn't an glory-assembled cast... the score wouldn't be more than 6.0, but because no one want's to be the one to tell the truth... that the king is naked and this movie is more than mediocre.I'd give it a lower score, but the acting in it is really good, which isn't something that can save this bunch of nonsense."
233," Tarantino
","Movie scriptwriters, directors, producers and actors take note, master story teller and film maker is showing the world how legendary films are meant to be made and enjoyed!
Beginning to end (due to indelible teasers) Once Upon Time ... is pure entertainment!
I predict DiCaprio, Pitt and (child star!)Butters along with beautiful supporting cast, Robbie, Madsen, Russell (great narration), will break studio investment by First Week in August due to Word reviews alone!"
234," ABSOLUTE CLASSIC
",Tarantino spent time capturing the plot lines of each character and their acting rather than making it all about violence. You truly feel like you are a part of the 1969's atmosphere
235," Happy endings are Oh! Sooo satisfying! Bravo!
","For those of us old enough to remember the Manson 'episode' of California's and Hollywood's histories, and simultaneously young enough to have been inalterably shaken by that horror, OUaTiH is a justifiably satisfying re-write that exploits everything we love about movies and Hollywood, while suppressing the gross underbelly of humanity.The two A-list leads are our heroes! Bravo to Hollywood for building-up the 'hero worship' genre and to Tarantino for grabbing-on to it and faithfully stoking it for such a satisfying climax! Pitt deserves another Oscar nod for just being the golden-haired, low-key, stoic hero who separates what's important from what is not, and is just what we need at a time when everything else seems to he crumbling around us. Simultaneously, Tarantino glorifies the peppy pretty girls, the free spirits of the era, the mediocre TV and film efforts, and a sampling of iconic movie theaters of the time (and an excellent portrayal of the automotive mediocrity), while driving us down memory lane.Kudos! You will enjoy. A little slow in some places, otherwise...Yay!!"
236," Salvation!
","The first 2 reviews say it so well. I will simply add this: my thanks to Tarantino, DiCapprio, Pitt, Pacino, Dern & Russel who have played the underbelly plenty, for re-creating one of the Darkest events of my lifetime and with such a satisfying, salvation-granting comeuppance! I was cringing, noting all the music, dress, and 'mood' of '68-'69, when I heard the words Spahn Ranch and 'Squeaky' (Fromme). I knew Tarantino could and might re-create the murders. Instead ... ahhhh! See the movie; if you are from my generation (I'm 71), you will feel absolute liberation from the imagination's worst memories. THANK YOU cast and writer/director Tarantino."
237," Count me as a fan of this film
","Great goddamn movie. Beautifully shot, written, and acted. Lots of laughs. I actually choked up and got a little teary-eyed too. Well done, Quentin. You nailed it."
238," A True 1969 feel with Tarantino's Genius mind
","This movie is a must watch. Beautifully shot, every character does a fantastic job. I'm praying to god like most people are that he doesn't only do one more. Let's hope he changes his mind."
239," Don't waste your time.
","The movie was extremely boring, literally nothing happened in the 2 hours until the last 15 minutes, watch something else."
240," Fantastic Fantasy Restoring Sharon Tate As A Human Being
","All in all, I loved this movie as it's about my era, the Sixties. I'll let other people go over the detail. What struck me was that in fantasizing the ending and letting Sharon Tate live while doing in her murderers, not only is Tarantino giving us a wonderful fantasy to live out, but in the process he restores this lovely young woman. Think about it, what does the name Sharon Tate conjure? Torture and murder. Tarantino attempts to rescue her from that fate and give us back us a decent young woman, who although not a brilliant actress, deserves to be remembered as more than a victim. Over the course of the last 50 years her murderers have taken on mythic proportions while Sharon has been reduced to Poor Sharon. Tarantino instead gives us a more accurate portrait of a squalid band of murdering psychopaths, who in this version of history, get what they so richly deserved, while Sharon goes on to a real life. Although I've disliked most of Tarantino's movies, he does much to redeem himself with this wonderful homage to Sixties Hollywood. Thank you Quentin."
241," Easily in my top 10
",You are constantly expecting a large connection to take place throughout the film. The anticipation builds and Tarantino delivers!
242," Finding Fame and Violence in Hollywood
","This has everything I'd ever want from a Tarantino movie and more. It is one of the most Tarantinoy Tarantino movies in every aspect (just try to count how many bare feet shots there are, I dare you), and it's a film I'm already itching to see again. While I won't say it's better than ""Pulp Fiction"", for a massive fan of both the Golden Age of Hollywood and Tarantino himself, it's practically perfect and still wholly earns its 5 Star rating."
243," Tarantino's True Self
","This film Honestly like nothing Tarantino has ever done before. I don't even know how to put it into words, but I'll try.You go into a Tarantino film with a certain set of expectations about the kind of film you're going to see and how it will be rendered. With this film, I had the same expectations: Snappy dialogue, a kickin' soundtrack, lots of stylized violence and profanity, a wild cinematic execution and a non-linear narrative. We all know what makes a Tarantino film a Tarantino film. But it's also how his films make us feel that gives us the ability to recognize his work as HIS work. You don't expect any of his films to be Citizen Kane, but you enjoy it so much and appreciate his unique style that we consider him an artist, as he deserved to be considered one.When I saw this film, I didn't see the Tarantino I grew up watching. Yes, we had snappy dialogue, we had violence and profanity. Yes, we had a non linear narrative. But it was all executed in a way that was so polished and different that it did not feel as though you were watching a Tarantino film. How I felt watching it kind of took me off guard. Usually when Tarantino renders Los Angeles in a film, you get an almost comic-book kind of Los Angeles. In his films, he has a way of making LA his own. In THIS film, LA is portrayed as true to reality as possible, which ultimately enhances the realism in the atmosphere of these characters' lives. The tone and vibe is not Tarantino-like at all. This film is much darker, slower and deeper than any film he's ever done. Sure, almost of his films are analytical in some way or another, but this is centered around characters, where his previous films were centered around the narrative and cinematic execution. Sure, each of his characters were unique and had a purposeful voice, but in this film, he delves into them in a way he had never done before. A much deeper way. In fact, his characters were both stylistic and realistic at the same time, creating a balance between Tarantino's craft and this totally real world he's rendering on screen.It's the least Tarantino-like film he's ever made, yet oddly enough, at the same time, it feels like a Tarantino film. I don't know how he did it this way, but it works so well that I'm speechless. He really took his work in a different direction yet stayed true to his past style at the same time. Every single second of Once Upon a Time in Hollywood was magnificent, but I felt a variety of things that I just can't convey into a sensical explanation.You have to be a true Tarantino fan to at least know what I'm talking about. You DON'T have to be a Tarantino fan to appreciate this film."
244," Excellent
",You have to appreciate the whole film. Had me second guessing at every turn. Great story. Great acting. Tarantino at his best!
245," The Swinging 60's in Hollywood as told by Tarentino
","A love letter to Hollywood in the 60's this film is everything we have come to know and love from a Tarantino film, with a cleverly written script; witty and humorous dialogue; complex and interesting characters encountering various misadventures all set against the vibrant backdrop and upbeat soundtrack of the 60's.
Artfully done, I was thoroughly entertained the entire 2 hour and 40 minute run time but then again I know Tarantino films are a slow, delightful burn, which is why I have always been a fan. In today's age of instant gratification, this may be unappealing to more than a few, but for the die hard Tarentino fan, this one hits the spots just right."
246," A love letter
","When Once Upon a Time In...Hollywood was announced as a film all about the Manson Family, I was a bit worried. I'm not a part of my generation that worships Charles Manson and thinks he really had anything interesting or relevant to say. In fact, I've compared him to advertising consultants and TED talk speakers, two groups that I find as abhorent as the man who ordered the murder of everyone in the house where Sharon Tate lived and believed that the ""White Album"" was to be the start of a race war that his Family alone would survive. I didn't want a Tarantino film all about Manson. And good news. This movie is anything but. Instead, it's a love letter to the end of the studio system as Hollywood moves from dashing square jawed leading men to neurotic antiheroes for a few years before blockbusters would change the game all over again.My worries about the Manson Family in this film were unfounded. Sharon Tate exists as an angel here, above and beyond the cares of the characters that somehow live in the same world as her. She dances alone, not only at the Playboy Mansion but throughout the reality this film has stitched together. She's as much of an ideal and McGuffin as Pulp Fiction's briefcase. Her mention of what a great actor Rick was is enough to make him forget that he just stared death down and might have almost lost the only person in the world who truly loves him, no matter what.Near pefection. Amen."
247," To understand this film, you have to know history
","It is amazing how Tarantino took the hot topics of 1969 of Hollywood and transformed it into one story: The shifting of Hollywood into the new era, the rise of the hippies and the Manson family's murders.The lead characters are fictionals but the rest of the characters are based on real people. Tarantino took the real story, added two fictional, relatable characters and changed the outcome of the real tragic event like he previously does in Inglorious Basterds and Django.The directing and cinematography are amazing. Tarantino did this movie for himself and not for the fans. He created his art in his way, how he likes it and did not think about the critics or the majority of the fans which are used to like certain types of movies only.He invests in his characters and scenes. Many scenes can be cut out and not hurt the story but he kept them because of the different directing style of the scenes although it has nothing to do with the story.Tarantino used many different directing styles. He mixed many methods from old Hollywood and the new. If you are familiar with old and recent movies you will notice it.There are also too many pop culture references which i loved. If you are fan of oldies than you will love it.The performance by the leading actors were fascinating. Leonardo is known for his perfect acting in every character he takes over but Brad Pitt stole the show. We are used to see oscar worthy performance from DiCaprio but Pitt carried the story on his shoulder. I hope both of them get oscar notes. If leonardo gets it and Pitt not, then it will be really unfair. I am sure 100 percent that Tarantino will get oscar nomination for his directing. Margaret did not have too many lines in the movie but she delivered her character's story with only acting. In many scenes she only acted and did not talk and still told the story. Now that's acting. I hope she get noticed and nomination too by the Academy Awards.This movie is not for everyone. People who understand Hollywood and movies will enjoy it but for the people who enjoys only Marvel movies, it's not your movie to watch."
248," Not my kind of movie.
","The action was SLOW and there was so much minutiae background building that it had me struggling not to fall asleep. It was a LONG movie. That was a dark time in the 60s when Manson was around, but the movie was so slow building that it had me looking at my watch to see when it would end. However the last 5 minutes was fast and furious in typical Tarantino form and had us all hanging on to our seats. I would not recommend this movie."
249," Amazing movie
","""It has no plot""
People needing a constant stream of storytelling spoonfeeding and who obviously don't understand or even know the story behind the manson family murders, which was being worked up to and foreshadowed throughout the whole movieIf you're one of those people saying you ""sat around waiting for the plot to show up"", then you had no idea what you were getting into going into this movie, everything was being built up to from the start."
250," Love the political incorrectness! It's so refreshing in today's suffocating political correctness.
","Another Quentin Tarantino masterpiece. What if we could go back in time and change the horrible fate that awaited Sharon Tate and her friends on that summer night of 1969. It was great to see those ""dirty hippies"" walk into the home of a failing actor with a fire blasting gun and a body double with a pet pit bull."
251," A triumph
","One of Tarantino's best works, some of the greatest acting ever. Magnificent cinematography and editing. A sure fire Best Picture nominee or winner. The comedic side of it is hilarious and fun.
I've seen other reviews on here, saying it's boring with no plot. So wrong. The plot is Leo and Pitt's characters looking for work in the summer of the Manson murders in LA. And for those saying it's boring, too bad. If you are expecting all movies to action packed with little dialogue, than why are you watching movies? This film is an absolute triumph for Tarantino"
252," Not a ""feel-good"", but the movie makes you FEEL good
","4 years. That's how long we had to wait for Tarantino to return to the big screen. Now that's an awful long time, but as the saying goes: good things happen to those who wait - this movie does not dissapoint.Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is Tarantino's homage to the cinematic world and to, of course, Hollywood as it was back in its golden days - and what a stunningly good looking film it is. You can't help but admire the broad colour palette, the beautiful cars, old school billboards and the gorgeous neon lightning of the many cinemas, which together manages to create a more than believable 1960's Hollywood. An almost glorified version perhaps - in a good way - like a piece of candy you just want to reach out and grab. While mentioning the beauty of this film, one cannot forget to also mention the soundtrack, that is as close to ear-sex as you can come. I myself have listened to ""Bring a Little Lovin'"" on repeat since i left the theatre.The movie circles around the outdated actor Rick Dalton (Leo DiCaprio) and his stuntman Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt), as well as following Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie) on her daily adventures. The main story at hand is the one of Rick and Cliff, but for those well informed knows that the year of 69' was a special one, in a sort of way, for Hollywood. Without saying too much, it involves Sharon Tate and Charles Manson. While being the background story, and the one inspired by true events, it fits really well with Rick Dalton and Cliff Booth's story. And Tarantino being Tarantino, you better believe that he ""Tarantino-fies"" the whole situation.At the same time as Tarantino is being Tarantino, it is also a very different movie than what we're used to seeing. It touches on the brink of comedy, but not the silly comedy that were used to in films such as The Naked Gun or Mr.Bean no, this is Tarantino comedy. And my god he handles it well. The whole movie is a beautiful roller coaster, with not a lot of steep ups and downs, but with mature humour that is sure to make an audience have a great movie experience. As to give an example: seeing Brad Pitt play a minacious stunt driver, with a sketchy past, getting high and having a gun pointed at him is hilariously funny, and it's also one of the best scenes in the movie.Do you need to mention the acting? When you have names as Margot, Brad, Leo and even Al Pacino himself you expect stellar performances - and that is what we got, plain and simple. Leo gives his best ever performance, Brad is scary good as a mysterious stunt driver, Margot is absolutely wonderful as the joyful Sharon Tate, and Al pacino, well, Al Pacino is Al Pacino.Tarantino said this is the closest he's ever gotten to recreate Pulp Fiction. He also said that he put it all into this film, and you really can feel it. To experience Tarantino at this level is truly breathtaking. With the natural talent found within him and all the experience he's gotten from his past of remarkable films, he brings it all out on this one - and it pays off. You can feel Tarantino's breaths (Not literary, that would be somewhat disturbing) sitting opposite the movie screen. You can feel his heartbeat (Not literary either) pulsating throughout the film. All of his passion and love for cinema is felt right through the screen and it touches your feelings. It makes you feel good.Sad as it is, Tarantino has stated he will only make 10 movies - which I respect. After Once Upon a Time in Hollywood's release, he has stated he might retire before his 10th. How sad it is, this film feels like the perfect end note for him. I wouldn't say he is at his peak, because he has peeked ever since Reservoir Dogs, but with this film he has truly proved himself as a master of cinema."
253," One of TARANTINO'S BEST
","Once Upon a Time in Hollywood - Movie ReviewWhere do I even begin with a movie like this. WoW, just WoW. Quentin Tarantino has out done himself. This is by far the BEST TARANTINO movie. The way he wrote and directed this movie is beyond phenomenal and amazing.Leonardo DiCpario as Rick Dalton was so good. He plays a washed up actor trying to make a name for himself again in 1960s Hollywood. DiCpario captured the essence of this role and played it to a point where this role was better than his role in Django Unchained. DiCaprio one ups himself in every scene he is in and it shows.Brad Pitt as Cliff Booth stole the show and made the movie beyond amazing. The character of Cliff Booth is the Stuntman to Leonardo DiCaprio's Rick Dalton character. The back story that is given to Cliff Booth is intense and shocking so to speak. Brad Pitt from the moment he is shown in this movie just makes the movie better. This is his BEST PERFORMANCE as an Actor and it shows.Margot Robbie as Sharon Tate. The character is not in it all that much. Maybe close to about 15mins of total screen time and that was it. The character really didn't have to be in the movie, but when you see it. You will understand why.Al Pacino finally makes his debut in a Tarantino movie. He plays Marvin Schwarzs a local Hollywood Agent. While Pacino's role was minor, he left a mark on the movie and it was good to see him portray this character.Mike Moh as Bruce Lee, was done so well. He captured the feel and look of Bruce Lee and even sounded like him. There is a great scene between Bruce Lee and Cliff Booth that is both funny and bad ass.Kurt Russell as Randy. Randy is a stunt coordinator for one of Rick Dalton's movies and also serves as the narrator for this movie. As he narrates the movie it's done in a subtle way where it keeps your attention.There are other minor actors in the movie, But they had small parts in the movie to serve as some small backstory to everyone.Now the dog, yes I said dog. The Dog that in this movie is great. I can't say much more about it, but it does play a major role in a few scenes. If there was an Oscar for animals. This Dog would WIN.The music in the movie really takes you back to the 1960s. The way Tarantino captures the feeling and emotion of the music with this story setting is unbelievable and makes the movie work so well.The cinematography in this movie is by far the BEST in any Tarantino movie. The tracking shots were smooth and clean. The editing was good and quick but added to the suspense of the movie. The interior car scenes are the best, as the camera is positioned in the back capturing both Rick Dalton and Cliff Booth.Tarantino has made a movie that is a call back to the 1960s. The ending is by far the best and most shocking. Especially the way it was done, he had intense moments that worked for a movie like this.This is a MUST SEE movie. Especially if you are a Tarantino fan, he knocked it out of the park with this one and it truly shows, and if you are not a Tarantino fan still go see this movie and you will understand why this movie is the BEST movie of 2019.Once upon a Time in Hollywood - Rating 10 out of 10"
254," An Incredible Classic!
","This is such a spectacular film that my father and I saw countless of times at the theater. Mr. Tarantino directed and wrote a classic and such an amazing story! As soon as the film starts, I embarked on a journey back in time. Rick Dalton tries his best to make it through a changing Hollywood along with its challenges and hardships. However, his best friend and stuntman is always there for him! Sometimes the years change before our eyes, but when passion and dedication is still active, hope never dies and we overcome the hard times. Rick Dalton never gave up through a changing Hollywood and even took risks he never thought possible by going across the pond.
As the film progresses, the ending was such a great scene to see! Brandy stole the show by saving the night and placing justice; such a great ending to a very classical and amazing film that will forever remain in the history books. Thank you Mr. Tarantino and the whole crew for taking us to a time that I didn't have the chance to live! I highly recommend this incredible movie."
255," A Complete Masterpiece
",This movie is hands down the best one I have watched in a long time. Quentin Tarantino will always be the GOAT in my eyes. 10/10
256," Awesome Movie; Ignore the Bad Reviews
","One has to understand some of the history behind Charles Manson before watching this great movie and reviewing it. Phenomenal acting by DiCaprio, Pitt and Robbie. There were some great cameos as well. I love when Tarantino rewrites history where the good guys prevail overall.Anyone who rated this movie less than 8 should not be allowed to rate and review movies at all. This is where IMDB fails society; when they let any moron review and rate a movie. Many times I have to rate a movie which is not truly a 10 a 10, just to counter the morons who vote them a 1."
257," What was that?
","Over-long and without a plot of any substance, this is another movie about Hollywood, like La La Land, that Hollywood loves to love, but rarely delivers on the promise for the rest is us. Despite good performances by Robbie, DiCaprio and Pitt it drifts along, and on and on. Maybe I missed something...."
258," Not what I was Expecting
","Quentin Tarantino's 9th film features some of the biggest superstars in the business. Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt really are the best duo since Paul Newman and Robert Redford. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is worth watching just for the epic star power alone along with Tarantino's signature killer soundtrack. Tarantino is known to subvert norms and create controversy. He does so here, but to a lesser satisfying degree.When news first hit about Tarantino doing an old Hollywood piece centering around the Manson murders of 1969, one could assume he'd be doing another wild over-the-top bloodbath with snappy dialogue, entertaining storytelling and iconic characters. While the Mansons and Sharon Tate are present in the film, their roles are disappointingly underrepresented. Sharon Tate (played gleefully by Margot Robbie) does not do much throughout the movie but watch her own films. The Manson ranch is shown but Charlie Manson is only present for five seconds. These people vital to the real life story don't really have much purpose here. The story focuses more on Leonardo DiCaprio's character Rick Dalton, a former TV star trying to stay relevant in the Hollywood spotlight.While the story at hand with Rick Dalton has its moments (Bruce Lee scene and forgetting lines), it's too long and too dragged out. Tarantino goes for setting an authentic feel, and establishing character development over plot. Much of the film feels like it's going nowhere, so it's boring sometimes. The film is more of a love letter to old Hollywood. A lot of work was put into taking us back in time to 1969, impressively done without CGI. It's impressive technically but it lacks an exciting narrative - something Tarantino normally delivers on. The first two hours or so shows everyday life for these characters, but doesn't become a 'movie' until the end. The last 15 minutes is classic Tarantino. Without spoiling it, it utilizes everything we have come to know and love about Tarantino. He subverts your expectations, but to a lesser satisfying degree.A film where Tarantino brought every act of his storytelling prowess together was The Hateful Eight. The Hateful Eight set up a mystery while making the audience guess what was going to happen next. Then it climaxed into a violent, hysterical, quotable, and utterly badass bloodbath. But what Once Upon a Time in Hollywood was lacking was the build-up to the climax. The ending was just slapped on so you know you're watching Tarantino. The Hateful Eight worked better as a story which is why the ending was much more satisfying than this film.Once Upon a Time in Hollywood delivers some rare cinematic treats, courtesy of Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt. However, one can't help but feel a little disappointed with Tarantino given the stellar cast and the legendary Manson backstory he had to work with."
259," Masterpiece
","Much feet, very nice. Feet everywhere, I absolute love it. There were countless toes, and I felt like I could smell them through the screen. Oh god I love Tarantino"
260," Another Masterpiece from Tarantino !
","I enjoyed every second of this movie , bravo Quentin Tarantino"
261," Not for Fast and Furious and Transformers fans
","If you start heading for the exits if a movie goes five minutes without a car chase or an explosion and subtitles immediately turn you off from a movie, don't see this film. You know who I'm talking about.This is a true time traveler movie. The audience is taken back in time to 1969 Hollywood to spend time with the lead actor and stuntman Richard Dalton and Cliff Booth. It's quite incredible, would love to see someone do this with Las Vegas in the past, I go there a lot and the history of the place is fascinating. I enjoy movies in which the director takes time and care trying to recreate the past. I view it as kind of a sport. If you want to see a production that absolutely failed at reproducing the eighties, watch the first season of Narcos and play spot the historical anachronisms. It's brutal. It's better if you were born around that time. People born in the nineties and 2000s don't understand. They've lived with cellphones their whole life. That and the internet pretty much changed the world significantly.I appreciated the movie. It's classic Tarantino. I'd have to say that it's his best since Django Unchained, which was his best since Jackie Brown. Kill Bill and Inglorious were awful. I don't care. Django was good but I was worried he was starting to enjoy the violence in his films too much. Once Upon in Hollywood has convinced me he can make a good movie without relying on that nonsense. The violence is there but it's few and far between. Not sure if Tarantino was worried it was costing him work but he did a great job controlling himself here.Definitely must-see unless you're the sort of person that pre-orders Michael Bay and Vin Diesel movie tickets."
262," Great Freaking Movie
","I am up and down on QT. but this movie reached out and grabbed me. DeCaprio and Pitt were amazing together. their chemistry was Redford/Newman good. the Spahn Ranch scene was creepy without being over the top. there were SO many great smaller roles, many featuring well known actors that were so hidden in their characters that i was surprised numerous times during the credits. the cigarette smoking was so pervasive i left the theatre with a hacking cough. this is one of those movies that will reveal new gems with each viewing. i grew up during the 60's and this movie nailed my memories and dreams. and the ending.......Oy Vey. i have had a long standing top 10 favorite films. this movie just elbowed it's way in."
263," Some people don't seem to understand it...
","This is definitely a film made for fans of classic cinema and nostalgia. The scenery, the cars, the music, everything brings a special sort of feeling of Hollywood's Golden Age. There's a specific scene towards the end, a montage of various restaurants and businesses turning on their neon signs, that really captures that feeling. The Batman and Robin radio ad during the credits was a nice touch, especially as a fan of the Adam West TV show.All the actors do a superb job in this film, Leo is definitely Oscar bait for best actor.I'm reading a lot of negative reviews from Tarantino fans. They were expecting violence and gore throughout, a staple of Tarantino films. They didn't get that in this film. All the violence takes place the last 20 or so minutes. So I can understand why some would be upset by that. But it's the reason I like this film over other Tarantino films. It gave us a suspense. We all know what happened on August 8th, 1969. We were anticipating it. So when it came time, it was a nice payoff. I understand some others are upset because Tarantino tries to ""rewrite"" history by depicting the 2 lead characters (+ a cute pit bull) killing the 3 Manson Family members in a very gruesome and satisfying way. I understand the past still happened and the reality of the actual situation is sad and horrible to say the least. But I did feel a bit of poetic justice seeing the 3 family members taken down like that, and so did the rest of the audience who cheered during the whole scene. At the end of the day, this movie isn't for everyone. But for the people it is for, like myself, I was entertained beginning to end."
264," Give Brad Pitt the Oscar
","Great buddy movie about a Hollywood B-List actor and his trusty stunt double on the eve of the Sharon Tate Murders. The script by Tarantino is absolutely fantastic and in my opinion his best script. It never feels like a Tarantino movie until the finale. Brad should get the Oscar for his work as the trusty stunt double who has a problem with the law but is also the authority figure of the film. Hollywood is full of people who gave their lives to the industry who never got the recognition they deserved or had careers cut short, and this movie is for them."
265," This movie is great but not for everyone...
","I would like to start of this review with saying that this movie is not for everyone. Most people just want to be entertained with linear storylines. If you are looking for this, this movie is not for you.This is pure art, great atmosphere setting, acting and cinematography. The little nuances and references are amazing if you can appreciate it."
266," I Never Thought...
","...that I'd walk out of a movie that features the manson family (I have purposely used lower caps) feeling the way I did. I cannot say much more. If I were YOU, who's reading this right now- do not read anything else anywhere about this movie! I walked into it only knowing about the manson family crimes and nothing about this actual movie. I hadn't even planned on seeing it, but I am so glad I did! Three hours long? What? Did not feel like it. I'm so glad it wasn't shorter! Bravo, Mr. Tarantino! Wow!!! I love how they portrayed Sharon Tate, contrary to something I just read. He did justice to characters where they were due. Remember, DON'T READ ANY SPOILERS OF ANY KIND BEFORE SEEING THIS! I just need to stop right here lol"
267," Slow Burning Fuse
","This film is like watching a long fuse slowly sparkle and burn it's way to one hell of a firecracker. You know where it's going, but the bang is bigger than you expect. A true treat throughout. Pure cinematic bliss."
268," Quentin Tarantino is the truth
","Films needed saving this year and oh boy Tarantino saved the s*** out of it. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood may not be Tarantino's best work, but it damn sure comes close to taking that spot. The directing is phenomenal, Quentin Tarantino exquisitely shows once again why he is one of this generation's auteurs. The performances from everyone, especially Leo and Brad, are extraordinary and the writing is superb, as were given dialogue that only Tarantino could pull off. If any other director/writer tried the conversations he works in this film; then half the audience would probably have fallen asleep. This also may be Tarantino's funniest film yet, and because of that, it made for one of my favorite theatre experiences of the year. I don't think I've laughed that hard at a movie as I did with Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. However, with all that said what may be the most impressive thing about this film is the cinematography and set pieces. Tarantino does a fantastic job transporting the audience into this world, and I never felt for a moment that this wasn't Hollywood during the '60s.Nevertheless, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is not perfect, it's pretty damn close to it, but I do have an issue with the film, and that's pacing. Throughout the film, multiple scenes could be removed from the final cut and wouldn't affect the outcome of the movie at all. While other (necessary) parts of the film are way longer, then they have any right to be. Unnecessary scenes, info, and dialogue are my biggest gripe with Tarantino as a writer. You could, however, look on the other side and say that those ""unnecessary"" scenes are quite entertaining, and they usually are, and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is no exception. Although it has those elongated dialogues and unnecessary scenes, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is still pretty entertaining at being gratuitous so it somewhat (not entirely) makes up for it.In a year full of unoriginal and disappointing films, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood truly stands out from the pack. Tarantino's ninth film is not without its faults, but what film isn't? Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, elegantly displays why Quentin Tarantino is one of the greatest filmmakers ever and is easily the best film of 2019. An obvious recommend."
269," BEST TARANTINO FILM EVER.
","Go to an early showing, its a 3 hour film. And WORTH EVERY SINGLE SECOND. But, you want to be awake and alert because it it slow going at the beginning and then it slowly builds over time to one of the best most satisfying movie endings i have ever seen. Go early, pay attention, enjoy the ride."
270," Will millennials like?
","Loved the movie, had so many deja vu moments watching it. Would suggest that younger people that aren't up on Manson family places and names google just so you understand some references. There is so much to enjoy in this movie! If you are unfamiliar with the names and places and times of some of Manson family history you will not get a lot of this movie. Please know at least some of the history before you say it's boring...."
271," I wanted to watch again as soon as it ended.
","Another Tarantino masterpiece, Leo & Brad are outstanding!"
272," The worst movie i watched this year
","It is just horrible. Watching this was torture. This movie suppose to be homage to Hollywood in late '60's. But instead it turned out to be pretentious bs. Tarantino needs to retire. He is so eager to make another epic movie, but his glory days are long gone."
273," Tarentino at his best
","It's just like Quentin to add his recognized touch of misleading the public to a new level. Much like Inglorious Basterds where hitler died in a theater fire does manson's crew meet a fate worse than death when they tried to kill Sharon Tate and her company of friends. Although any one of us who were born before 1969 know that this story was only semi-fictional. Manson's crew did kill Sharon, Abigail Folger and the rest including the La Bianca couple a few days after. Yet the question to all of this, is 'What If"" Many who saw this film had to ask that it might have been a mistake on Manson's part of picking the wrong house or at least his crew did, which resulted in their grossly and untimely demise at the hands of the stunt double (Pitt) and of course his boss Dalton (DiCaprio) who saved everyone by silent proxy with their blue collar attitudes.I really enjoyed this take on the manson case as it was the most horrific event during the tumultuous sixties while the vietnam war was going on. Tarantino did get one part right, that Sadie did leave before the assassination was to start. That much is certain. But to see Squeaky fromme, Leslie Van Houten and Steve Grogan get mauled, clubbed, stabbed, nearly castrated by a dog, and blown torched was icing on the proverbial cake. Again it's the idea of ""What If?"" Both DiCaprio and Pitt were amazing together as struggling scamps of hollywood during its evolutionary period of censorship, and many cases of discrimination against those who changed an industry. Since manson's death in prison there had been talks about who was to direct his life story. The only other movie that had in depth details about his life and his family was a film called Helter Skelter and manson's portrayal played by Steve Railsback. Who had numerous nominations applied in his honor. Yet it is still a very sensitive subject for surviving family members to this day. Especially for Polanski and the Folger company. However I am sure that Quentin will come up with a new project and wow the audiences again with the same question as to - ""What If?"""
274," Yawn
","This film was painfully slow, I only really enjoyed the last 45 minutes. Other than that it was a film about nothing although I do admit to falling asleep during parts of it."
275," Quentin Tarantino's best film ever!
","Nearly everything is memorable and done with perfection! There is so much good in this movie, I barely have any complaints at all (Rick Dalton) Leonardo DiCaprio is amazing and omg (Cliff Booth) Brad Pitt is one of the best actors ever! I'm not the type to spoil things, especially something that is a pure enlightening blast I will just say there's a lot of great homages and trivia that I figured out easily - I hope others notice the many cool things too. Such an excellent cast throughout and soundtrack; this better get nominated it deserves so much! Easily in my top favorite films ever made too. Also this is my 380th review on here!"
276," Homage to 1960's counter-culture film industry, and a lot of feet!
","This film is a homage to the past, to the junction when the old school film world was in flux, and the counter-culture film world was taking hold. Drugs, hippies and short skirts were usurping cowboys and injuns, and Quentin Tarantino is in love with the era that followed on from this.This film is undeniably brilliantly put together. The settings are great, and the actors are all perfectly suited to their roles and you can't help but fall in love with that world. This film is like a time capsule of Hollywood in a brief moment.Brad Pitt & Leo DiCaprio are wonderful as the leads, and we watch their journey in this world. In many ways, the underlying allegory is that this transition is a forewarning to all in the industry now, and the parallels are there for all to see.The problem for me is though that it's just too overlong and easily could have been sharply cut down. There were so many scenes that just dragged on, and some totally unnecessary. The Bruce Lee scene could have been cut, and actually has created some controversy which is best left for another time.Also there is Tarantino's foot fetish, and this film goes overboard on it. There's lots of references to some of Tarantino's old film collection, and really this film is a homage to his world as much as to all else.There's good moments, but a leaner film I think could have been better. Admittedly, I'm not a big Tarantino fan, and those who are will lap this up. There's lot to commend it for, and I did love the last half hour, but I can't see myself watching it again. Each to their own."
277," Insufferable
","The acclaim for this movie baffles me completely. I am no fan of QT films to begin with, but this one commits the biggest sin of all: Boring! This is pretentious, self-indulgent drivel.

280," The Best ever 🖤
","Shut up all of you , Tarantino haters and go watch disney's stupid movies . For me it is one of the best movies ever just because of Tarantino , Dicaprio and Brad Bitt . I am very very much happy and satisfied ."
281," Boring
","To start with the positives - nice play of Brad and Leo as always. Attractive colours but still somehow unnatural.
Could not share any compliments with reference to the story itself. No plot whatsoever. Total chaos of the line.
Boring, childish, slow.
Still cannot define the movie as any genre in particular-not a comedy, not deep enough for a drama and not properly salty to cover a parody.
Despite the massive advertising my personal assessment is poor."
282," Disappointed
",3 hours of average. I don't understand the hype. Great acting. Cinematography was amazing. Story line sucked.
283," Most boring movie
",One of the most boring movies I have seen. I felt asleep most of the time

",Waste of time.... no story..... high class actors wasted
285," Once upon a time....Hollywood made good movies
","Well, not anymore! This movie proves that no matter how many great actors are put in a movie, they just can't make a movie worth watching anymore. I literally felt my IQ drop while I pushed through this show. I'm just going to leave it right here because there really isn't anything worth saying about this movie. Save your money, your time, and just pass on this one."
286," Painful...
",Seriously painful to watch and the length of the movie is just crazy... I watch a lot of movies and this tops the list of the worst movie in recent history....Very artistic but to what purpose....the storyline never really takes off and the movie could haven been shorten to the last 20 mins....and still that would be a pointless movie...
287," Great acting, beautiful cinematography, and very boring
","Literally 2 hours and 35 minutes of nothing, and then 5 minutes of fun. Tarantino movies tend to be slow paced, but usually the dialogue is interesting, fun, suspenseful, this has none of that, just a bunch of boring scenes, whose only purpose was to fill the run time. I have a feeling that people give it great scores because by now it is expected for a tarantino movie to be great, but this one is not..."
288," Worst Tarantino Film!
","I am a huge fan of Tarantino but this film lacks everything. It feels like you are waiting a long time for a slight build up for something only to be very disappointed. While watching the film I was over half of the way through the film and still didn't have any direction the film was going into, but like many others in the theatre we continued to watch hoping and begging for something to happen.Admittedly there're a few comical scenes in the film but these do not make up for the lack of direction the film has, I feel that QT didn't know whether to delve into the Charles Manson cult or the nostalgia of the films in the era. Margot Robbie's character seems to be only a nod to the Manson cult once again but her role bares no significance to the movie what so ever.I bare this as a warning if you want anything of the Quintin Tarantino films we all enjoy to watch, you will be waiting for the last 30minutes. I also feel for the great cast that has been assembled in this film it should have been a billboard breaker but I feel it will not."
289," In my opinion Tarantino's best film, mild spoilers(nothing too plot specific).
","While yes that might be controversial to say, I still rank Pulp Fiction above it because of the amount of cultural significance it holds. I would 100% say this is his best modern film, and also his modern masterpiece.
The film is heavily layered with references, and symbolism. Especially during the first act, to someone who doesn't understand the references and homages it might be boring. But I was completely engaged. I can only review this as a fan of the director, the medium and the actors in the film.
Each shot was carefully chosen, from westerns to horror. I honestly believe he saw the original Hills Have Eyes while writing the screenplay. The cinematography was beautiful, I tried my best to carefully analyze each scene.
Brad Pitt played his role beautifully, representing an alpha male. As Cliff the stuntman, Leo's stunt man to be exact.
While it might be cliche' it truly is his love letter to Hollywood, with Sharon Tate representing everything ""pure"" about Hollywood. The real life tragedy add's a lot of emotional weight to the film. Every scene is filled with dread, knowing what happened to Sharon in real life.
Leonardo Dicaprio, is an aging actor who in my opinion represents Quentin Tarantino himself. An aging man who is fighting to stay relevant and great while the critics tear him apart. There are particularly touching scenes between him and a young actress, where Dicaprio's acting chops make you believe every second of it.
The antagonists are Manson's disciples and fill every scene with tension, like an 80's slasher film. And in my opinion they represent everything Tarantino hates about the modern film industry and everyone in it.
The film is a great arthouse film, a great homage film, a great spaghetti western, a great comedy, a great gore-fest, a great Tarantino flick and a beautiful tribute to not only Hollywood's great era in the 60's. But also the symbol of it all, Sharon Tate(R.I.P.) who Margot Robbie played with great nuance.
This film is worth every penny, watch it in theaters before it's too late.
It will be considered one his top 3 films in 10 years.
This film will stick with you, the more you think about it. The more you unravel."
290," Who Doesn't Love A Well-Trained Dog?
","Spoiler alert:Yeah . . .This movie may encourgage a lot of people to get a Pit Bull. To those people I say, ""Please adopt, please be kind to your dog and PLEASE obedience train your dog.""""Brandy"" (""Sayuri"" in real life) is the canine who steals every scene she's in. What a terrific actor she is. I'm not alone in thinking she deserves the highest praise for her acting chops. Did you know?---- ""Perhaps that's why she won the film its only award at Cannes: the Palm Dog award. (Seriously.)"" (Vanity Fair article about Brandy.)Haha. GOOD dog. I would love to meet her.Along with Brandy, Tarantino's film has a lot going for it. Pitt and DiCaprio are utterly amazing in the movie.Their performances are top notch. I particularly enjoyed watching Pitt. His ability to lose himself in his role always pleases me.Pacino kind of rubbed me the wrong way, however, and I'm not sure why. He just didn't seem to mesh with the vibe of the story. It was like he was an afterthought, uncomfortably ""there,"" with a character he was unable to play. And I always like Pacino. This is his worst acting that I've seen, by far.As ever, I read nothing and knew nothing about this movie before viewing it. I do love a good surprise. It was fantastic to see all the cameos, the imitation Bruce Lee, the Old Hollywood neon signs. Wherever did they find the old signs? They look so perfect. I could swear some aren't just from old photos or film recordings.Tarantino has outdone himself with this. I like his retelling of the tale and I wish deep in my heart that Cliff and Brandy and Rick had been there to save Sharon Tate and the others from their grisly fate.Thanks for the excellent, ride, Quentin. I really really enjoyed it. Especially Brandy, the flamethrower, the humor and the happy ending."
291," Damn Hippies
","Thanks to the mostly spoiler-free trailer, I didn't know what to expect going into Once Upon A Time...in Hollywood. I had hoped it would be respect to Sharon Tate and her family and, thankfully, I do think it was. What surprised me most was how little of Sharon there really is in the film. She only has a handful of lines, but Margot Robbie makes the best of what she has to work with.The real stars here are Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt who turn in career-best performances as a western actor and his stuntman/best friend who get caught up in Hollywood regime changes, feeling useless, and a crazed group of hippies run by some guy named Charlie Manson.At well over 2 1/2 hours, there's plenty of room for tedium and boredom to set it, but I was so engrossed that I couldn't even leave to go to the restroom. Once the finale rolls around, it's totally worth it. It's a real crowd pleaser."
292," Tarantino Rewrites History ... Again
","In his ninth film noticeably lacking in the usual Tarantino shtick (thank God there was no Mexican stand-off!), he has produced perhaps his most intelligent film. The young and the old is a major theme that plays out throughout the film. Old Hollywood vs New Hollywood. 1969 was a year of deep change in Hollywood. Hollywood suddenly discovering that a young audience existed that did not want to see movies with middle-aged and older stars, and was struggling to urge that audience to see their movies. This is where Rick Dalton (DiCaprio) finds himself, an ""old"" as in 1950's, star, attempting to find a new image and shake the inescapable conviction that he is a has-been. There is a reason why one of the songs from that era, The Rolling Stones, ""Out of Time,"" is in the movie soundtrack. Both Rick and the Old Hollywood are ""out of time.""The subtext that lies underneath throughout the movie is Sharon Tate, Charlie Manson, his Family, and Sharon's Tate's entourage. Not only is Sharon Tate a neighbor but he and his stunt man, played by Brad Pitt, continually encounter Manson and his group throughout the movie. The New Hollywood lost its innocence with the Tate-LaBianca murders. There is no innocence in Rick Dalton's life, though. He's on the downslide and he knows it.Just as Inglorious Basterds re-wrote the history of the Second World War, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood re-writes the fate of Sharon Tate and the other people on Cielo Drive that night. The title is very appropriate. This really is a fairy tale, this is not how the actual events occurred, but the way we would have liked the story to end. At the same time, this is a snap-shot of a specific time and a specific place which is stone-cold reality and spot on. Tarantino has done such a good job in showing the changing face of Hollywood that the movie can be considered to be a time capsule. If you were there you will relish the past coming back to life again; if you weren't this is the best way to depict how it was without using a Time Machine to take you back."
293," A stunning ode to Hollywood and La La Land
","Once Upon a Time in Hollywood might just be Tarantino's most accomplished film to date. Masterfully directed, with one of the most satisfying endings to a film. The script is deliberately long and fletched out, with multiple overlong scenes that add brilliant depth to a stunning film. The razor sharp dialogue adds to an already stunningly beautiful film. As great as Brad Pitt is in this, Leonardo DiCaprio just proved why he is Hollywood's golden boy. A performance many won't appreciate fully, but DiCaprio really shines and gives a performance reminiscent of old Hollywood where actors understand characterization and emotive scenes."
294," Tarantino ready for retirement
","A shockfully boring and dissapointing movie. Only things that stand out are the acting of Di Caprio, the touch of the 60s era and the last 10 minutes of the movie. Other than that, if this movie did not have Tarantino label, would be vut before reaching production. Wait for it... It will never come! Only for 60s, cowboys, Brad Pitt and DiCaprio lovers..."
295," One of the most boring Tarantino films
","The plot is very similar to The Hateful Eight, which was also a boring film. First, there is a two hour tension and storytelling that doesn't provide much to the actual plot (which is pretty much non-existent). Then comes the slaughter and quickly after that the ending credits. Not my type of movie. I am a long-time Tarantino fan and hate to see what the new production has become."
296," Disappointed
","I love QT,also im a fan of brad pitt & dicaprio but film goes slowly,you know it's just hollow.no mean no target... sorry just sorry"
297," Masterpiece that not everyone will like and/or understand
","Beautiful cinematography,great acting, Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio look amazing on the screen.
But unfortunately our generation wants action and CGI in every corner so that's why not everyone will like this movie but it's sure worth watching)"
298," An awesome and satisfying movie!
","I felt like I was taking a stroll through 1960's LA and its movie-making world and will always be grateful to Tarantino for that.I take exception to the YouTubers who state that Bruce Lee is being made fun of. They miss the point of the scene. Bruce and Cliff are trash-talking and then fight one another on the set to test/show off their skills. Cliff can hold his own with Bruce Lee. For however funny a character he is, however, poor financially, he is deadly man and not to be dismissed. In another scene, Dalton mentions in passing that Cliff was a war hero. In scene after scene, Cliff pulls off amazing stunts: cars flying off cliffs, that sort of thing. He is tough and strong.SPOILER ALERT!This is why it is believable that Cliff could disarm and kill two of the three Manson attackers while doing 75% of the job on the third. They are armed with one gun and two knives. They are physically weak albeit fueled by mental derangement. Cliff is a skilled fighter, at physical peak, accompanied by the trained pit bull that loves him and Cliff just having taken quite a bit of acid. He is a warrior. One YouTuber (with 7.2K views already day of movie opening) mentioned that he saw more violence directed against the females. Tex got it pretty bad and if the scenes against the female attackers were just a tad more protracted it is surely because, in the sad real-life situation, they acted with more bloodlust against Sharon Tate, her baby, her houseguests and at the La Bianca's."
299," Bland and boring
","This film has fantastic acting but the horrible writing will put you to sleep, Brad is the only thing good about this film but even he can't carry this story on his back
QT did a fantastic job as director but can write for the life of him. definitely not a must see unless you are a fan of his."
300," Masterpiece
",From beginning to end so good... but the end..wow. I wish it was 4 hours.
301," Slow, boring, pointless, meaningless. More boring than Jackie Brown.
","This is a fictional story about a real life event with a twist. It is a homage to Hollywood nostalgia and movie making. However, for people who do not live in Hollywood or work in the industry, it is rather pointless and meaningless. It could have been made so much shorter (it is too long). Many people, for example the neighbors, did not need to be in the movie because they did not interact with the main characters and did not advance the plot. It could not even be considered a character study because the characters were rather shallow and not particularly likable. It was more boring than Jackie Brown. It did have good cinematography though."
302," An incredibly shocking history told in an incredible alternate way (DiCaprio and Pitt 10/10)
","I don't know why critics are being so harsh on the ending. For me, and for most people/fans I feel, it was awesome! Tarantino's always been a collage artist, a man cobbling together new stories from shards of the odd bit of cult culture here and there, and Hollywood sees him fully embracing that mode.This approach lets Tarantino cut loose, which is probably to the film's benefit, especially as we center on DiCaprio and Pitt as his leads. It's a bizarre thing to see former teen heartthrobs like these two suffer and flail about their closing careers, or to hear so many people call Pitt's character ""old."" (As one shirtless scene shows us, even old Pitt can still get it.) Of the two, Dalton has a harder time with it, his ego comically wrapped around the idea of his career fading. In one of his latest guest stints as a heavy on a Western, he connects briefly with his precocious eight-year-old co-star (an unstoppable Julia Butters) who reinvigorates his confidence as an actor, especially after an explosive breakdown in his trailer.DiCaprio is having particularly garish fun here, ripping into his signature Jordan Belfort-era intensity and turning his washed-up TV star into a petulant, gurning child, as you do when you're forced to contemplate cranking out spaghetti Westerns in Rome to keep your career afloat. On the other end of the spectrum is Pitt, all Southern drawl and stoicism, the kind of unstoppable Billy Jack figure who can fight to a draw with Bruce Lee (Mike Moh) and even hold his own in some tense confrontations with the Manson family. The two are gangbusters together, evincing even in their quiet moments the camaraderie of two men who've spent their lives together, Cliff being ""more than a best friend and a little less than a wife"" to Rick. They shine even when they split apart for their separate stories - Rick's guest spot on Lancer and Cliff's unexpected detour to the Manson Ranch - but each feels of a piece with the other.As for the Mansons themselves, they play a much more peripheral part in Hollywood than one might expect from a gore-lover like Tarantino. Instead, they're another layer to the gonzo tapestry he's woven, a group of young nutcases who've taken over Spahn Ranch (where the fictional Bounty Law was shot) and who give the older Cliff no amount of discomfort. They're a group of kids resentful of the largesse of Hollywood, who want to ""kill the people who taught us to kill"" through violent TV shows and movies; as one of cinema's foremost purveyors of bloodshed, it's a bold move for Tarantino to take.And yet, that self-reflexivity beats at the heart of Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, a film made by a man who sees his own obsolescence coming. Just as Cliff and Rick barrel inexorably toward the ""end of the trail"" for their partnership and the era of Hollywood that would take them in, so too does Tarantino see the same for himself. It's tempting to read it as an ""old man yells at cloud"" feature, with its characters' many resentments toward young bucks taking their jobs. But it's just as easy to imagine Tarantino owning up to the limitations of your age and range, instead tipping his hat and riding off into the sunset. He's got one more film in him, but even if this were Tarantino's swan song, it wouldn't be a bad note to go out on."
303," Worst movie in years...
","Ok... this is one of the worst, most boring movies ever! How did Quentin go down to this level? What am I failing to see? It's down right boring... if you were living in LA in 1969, great! You will love it! It's an explosion of a celebration of Hollywood LA in 1969... if you weren't, you can't relate... there are no plots, 30 minutes or more of Brad Pitt driving around, Leonardo being great for so little character depth, Pacino and Bruce seen get 5 minutes screen time FOR NOTHING, and don't get me started on Margot... why pay high for an actress if she is pointless in the movie??? She barely has lines. Pointless scenes, unjustified stories, and of course, the blood bath at the end. But even the blood bath is ridiculous and with no real fundamental purpose... 3 hours of this? No thanks!"
304," Once Upon a Time... in Tarantino's film
","Tarantino once again shows that he has his own way of making a movie. If he wants to linger in a moment, he will. He's in no rush to get anywhere. This is present for example in the form of the many clips of the shows and films Dalton has starred in. Some other director might have rushed through the period showcasing to get to the juicy bit of the Manson family. But the focus isn't on them here. Once Upon A Time is most of all a homage to the Hollywood's golden era and to its end.There is a very real sense of dread at the end when the Family is on the prowl, but also a sense of longing of knowing that an era is about to come to an end. That era is here symbolized by Margot Robbie's portrayal of Sharon Tate, who was murdered before her career really got off. But then something happens at the end, something completely surprising. The ending is one of my favorites I've seen in a long time. It ties the whole movie together and it left a smile on my face. It's Tarantino once again throwing the rule book out of the window.Leonardo DiCaprio's star fading Rick Dalton and his stuntman played by Brad Pitt are at the center of the film. The focus isn't on the Manson Family. And rightfully so. This is a tribute to a bygone era, and the death of Sharon Tate's sort of symbolizes its end, so screw them. Dalton's fading career is played against Sharon Tate's bright looking career in Hollywood. There's a sort of expecting atmosphere throughout the film, because you think you what is going to happen. That's the ending works so well. It's a relief.The film is filled with talented actors, but the two headliners; DiCaprio and Pitt are the ones who stand out the most. The chemistry between the two of them is real. DiCaprio plays his character like he did in Django Unchained. He's able to go from one extreme motion to another. Pitt's stuntman is more abstained, although he too has a violent side in him. But what works here is the relationship between those to. You get the feel that these two really have a long history together.There's a lot less violence this time around than what one is usually expecting from Tarantino. A couple of scenes are still here to tick off that box, and especially the latter one of them is hilarious. Music also plays an important role here with a soundtrack that's filled with tunes that fit the times and mood of the film.Tarantino has made a film that has heart, by mixing in fantasy with the events from the history. It feels personal, rather than just being an overview into the events of the late sixties Hollywood, the death of Sharon Tate and the Manson Family, which would have been a pretty uninspired approach from a director of Tarantino's caliber. This film's aspiration is much higher than that. It has the same elements that we have come to expect from Tarantino's film, but it managed to evoke feelings in me that his previous films haven't."
305," Absolutely Spectacular
","Written words cannot do this film justice, but I'll give it a shot.The first thing to mention is that I went into it almost completely blind. I watched the main trailer and nothing else. I was expecting a biopic with a Tarantino twist, and I suppose I got it.I don't want to say anything about the film's actual composition because part of the magic was going in blind. If you've read this far, you've read too far. Just go and see it. Then come back afterwards and agree with everything I've said.Usually when I finish watching a movie I take a few minutes or more to decide on my overall opinion, but that wasn't the case with this one. I've never been so quick to give anything a 10/10, and I once saw Billie Piper and John Barrowman in person.Speaking of attractive people, this film isn't exactly lacking in the looks department. With Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio leading as the Dynamic Duo of Dilfs, and Margot Robbie being Margot Robbie simultaneously, I was losing feeling in my feet from crossing my legs so hard.This film might legitimately be one of the best things I've ever seen. Not just one of the best movies, but one of the best things overall that's ever happened to me. If God himself decided to make a film he wouldn't be able to make one this good, even with the help of the mind-warping drugs that Tarantino undoubtedly uses as snacks when he writes his scripts.If someone were to tell me that I in fact hadn't watched the film and instead had done enough cocaine to kill a bear, set myself on fire, and hallucinated the whole thing, I'd absolutely believe them because that's exactly what it felt like to experience 'Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood'. Just go and see it, you'll never regret anything less."
306," Amazing talent, brilliant, genuine movie.
","First of all, the very best is not reading anything about this Tarantino movie at all before you go to the theatre. And yes, this one is really for the big screen not for home.Secondly, this was easily one of the best 3 hours at a theatre in my life, where nobody was eating any popcorn not drinking during the movie. And nobody wanted to believe it was over.The film is more the superb, the acting is brilliant, Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio have fantastic chemistry, both play their best in their career.
Everything is so layered, all the details fit, the storytelling is top notch, the script is unique, the directing is the greatest I've ever seen, soundtrack is perfect, cinematography is outstanding.And yes, this bit tops Pulp Fiction easily, although -without spoiling anything- it's totally different from every aspects.
Tarantino does not repeat itself, this is nothing what made earlier.Funny, entertaining, the suspense is thrilling and the twists are so surprising.Yes, this movie is a perfect storytelling, how a movie must tell a story. This is not a documentary, don't expect that. Yet, it is able to grasp a world we can't see anymore and take the audience to a journey where we can be a part of it.Very, very artistic movie by Tarantino, nothing like he made before."
307," Just a masterpiece to watch
","Absolutely beautiful, it was a joy to see Dicaprio and Pitt together! Tarantino as always a genius
A well done movie with beautiful techniques and dialogues"
308," An incredible experience !
","Clearly this film is not for everyone, it takes his time but is really exciting. The world that Tarantino offers is just magical. The acting is great, the two main roles are perfect, as is the technical aspect of the film.
Certainly one of the best
movie that Tarantino never did. The best movie of the year without hesitation"
309," Long, boring and pointless - AWFUL
","If it was possible to rate 0 stars, I would have done. 3 hours of absolutely dire, pointless, unending garbage, building up to the usual Tarantino round of gratuitous violence in the last few minutes. Absolutely do not waste your time or money watching this rubbish."
310," Tarantino ran out of ideas
","After 2:45 hr min of constant jabbering about nothing, the only stuff worth mentioning is Brad Pitt throwing Bruce Lee into a car and BP /Leo killing some Mansonites. This movie is even worse than Hateful8. Dont waste your time and money. Its not worth it."
311," A love letter to lost innocence
","The sixties came to a crashing end with the Manson family murders, and Tarantino's tour de force laments that end with pathos and imagination. His best film since Pulp Fiction 25 years ago, it builds slowly through languid character-building scenes to the shocking conclusion. John Wick it ain't, and if you have the attention span of a gnat you won't like this film. I can't imagine any cinephile not loving it."
312," Tarantino's Magnum Opus
","Truly an outstanding film on all levels. Leonardo DiCaprio shows off his acting chops in every scene, reflecting how versatile and dynamic he is; his passion shines through. Brad Pitt is also wonderful in the film, portraying DiCaprio's loyal friend and companion. Every scene has been carefully crafted, every word carefully written, every detail has been filmed with fidelity. Tarantino personifies his love for film making in an amazing love letter to the old days of Hollywood.Reflecting on Tarantino's previous works, one can see how he arrived at this destination, and why Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is a culmination of his life work. There are elements from all of his films such as Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown (especially this one), and even Kill Bill. His ability to raise tension through dialogue is paramount to his film's successes, and has become a staple.The film organically builds the two friend's relationship and characters, bringing a delight to behold on screen; there are so many other characters Tarantino is able to bring to life as well, with some of them having very little dialogue at all. He leaves the audience wanting to know more about these characters, without having to develop them. Margot Robbie steals every scene she is in, and brings about a warm innocence to her character.Overall this film is a must-see, in a time when theaters are full of remakes, reboots, and sequels; this one stands out for its originality, and a golden era of Hollywood films, much of which is forgotten today. Tarantino's love and passion for his work truly shows here, and what we receive as his audience is a masterpiece to behold, and a 2 hour 41 minute film we wish could keep on going."
313," Overhypee because it's a QT
",If anyone but Quetin Tarantino made this movie it would be crucified by casual film goers and critics alike but since it is a 'QT' film people are wrongfully considering it a masterpiece.
314," An original that not all will enjoy.
","QT does it again. I absolutely loved everything about this movie. The genius writing, the costumes, the reviving of the 60's, holy cow.There is not many movies that don't have a defined plot that I love, but this one is incredibly well done. There was not one moment that I didn't enjoy, but the cake winner, that ending. Holy cow, the best last 10-15 minutes of a movie I've ever seen."
315," Tarantino shows his love
",The only point I wanted to make (other than the fact that boomers are going to get this film far more than younger viewers - especially the one-hit-wonder soundtrack) is that the two main characters are surprisingly nice people. Wonderful movie.
316," Quirky, Edgy, Dark, Funny
","I read a review that viewed this movie as social commentary, posing the question of what would have happened if Sharon Tate hadn't been killed by the Manson family. I must have watched a different movie. First, the movie doesn't tell us what would have happened one way or another. Second, we don't know from the movie that Sharon Tate wasn't killed. We don't see her in the end scene. Actually, in the end scene, I was left wondering if Leonardo's character would be murdered when he got to the Tate house. That other review said that Leonardo's character had finally been invited into the status that he had coveted. He may have been invited to the house, but we don't know what happened to him once he got there. The ending had a spooky feeling, and I was surprised the other reviewer had been able to read so much into what is essentially unknown. Now, if you want to watch it and then use it as a party game to come up with might have been an ending, that's fine. Other than that, the ending is -- well -- open-ended. I liked the movie. I found it humorous when these two guys stumbled into the Manson family retreat. I know the significance of that and, were it me, I'd have been out as quickly as possible. The characters didn't know what they were dealing with, which gave the movie both a dark humor and a kind of edginess."
317," Absolutely loved it
","Huge Quentin Tarantino fan. Saw this movie opening night and if I'm being fair I probably would have liked meat thrown on the screen simply because hey.. it's Quentin Tarantino.My initial thought was that it was a little long and at times a little slow. Probably because my expectation was a traditional Tarantino action bloodbath. Expectations aside I really enjoyed it.. solid 8/10.About a week after it's release I went back and saw it a second time. Knowing at that point that it was pretty much just a story about two good friends... friends that's are ""more than a brother and a little less than a wife""... And I absolutely loved it. Took it from a 8/10 to an absolute 10/10!I'm very familiar with the Manson murders... And I can't express how much anxiety I had as that last scene was starting to develop. After all.. we all know the unfortunate reality of what happened. The anxiety was real and just like Tarantino changed history in Inglorious Bastard's... we'll... Every fairytale begins with Once Upon a Time...Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio were amazing. The soundtrack was fantastic. Most of it taking place in the various cars being driven so they had the radio dj's doing there a little banter in between songs. which was a nice touch to an old timer like me. Margot Robbie was great as Sharon Tate. And Tarantino used actual footage of her when showing her movie on the big screen. A nice touch.Once upon a time in Hollywood is as good as any previous Quentin Tarantino movie. Highly recommended."
318," Wow what a movie. QT Movie is not for everyone
","What a hell of a movie, I loved the whole movie, specially the last scene. Wow Thank You So Much QT for doing this movie. Brad Pitt is 10 on 10, DiCaprio is also good here. Wow a Must Watch!"
319," Enjoy the sights & sounds of 1969 Hollywood
","First time I saw this movie in cinema & wasn't sure how I felt. I liked it but needed to see again. Watched again last night in the comfort of my couch, in my lounge room on my home theatre system.
Second time around I ""got it""
The story of Rick Dalton, Cliff Booth & to a lesser extent Sharon Tate are more of a sub plot. And I'm fine with this. The star of the movie is Hollywood & LA in 1969. Tarantino did a brilliant job with fantastic attention to detail in recreating the place in that period. The cinematography, the sights, sounds (cars, radio, tv, advertising posters, magazines, billboards) & the feel is just amazing. Watching this film is like tagging along with Rick Dalton & Cliff Booth jumping into the back seat of a classic car & being driven around Hollywood in that era. It's like being a fly on the wall in a 60's movie studio or being an invisible person following a day in the life of Sharon Tate.
The movie builds up to the famous night of the Charles Manson family murders of Sharon Tate & friends & subverts expectations in a way only Tarantino can pull off.The dialogue is very Tarantino & the acting & chemistry of DiCaprio & Pitt is perfect!Enjoy the movie for what it is - a tour of Hollywood in 1969."
320," Comedy at its finest
",The first two hours is a fresh comedy with excellent direction and brilliant actors then the last half an hour is classic Tarantino with his style of film it is still like a Tarantino film but don't expect pulp fiction or kill bill from this think of it as a comedy drama
321," An enjoyable journey with great scene makings
","Brad Pitt is on track .
OUATIH is quite interesting movie but I am sure its not for everyone but anyone who respects a grand cinema movie making will enjoy this one
Quite unique movie again from Tarantino"
322," This movie deserves way more than 10.
","This cannot be the review I want to give without the dreaded spoiler. But I do want to praise this film and the perfecto direction by the brilliant Tarantino. I'm sixty-five years old and was fourteen in 1969 and remember every dreadful moment. I sat through this movie without stopping it once and that is a rare thing for this old dude. The dreadful anticipation that many viewers my age experience when we watch films about Manson and his band of ghouls is what makes this film, in its totality, work like magic. And I don't want to leave out Brad Pitt and Leonardo because they were perfect too."
323," A Misunderstood Masterpiece
","I love this movie so much that I saw it three times in the theaters and five times overall. For those giving the movie bad reviews, they've watched it wrong. They expected another Django or Basterds like movie Tarantino. This one is simply different. This is Tarantino paying tribute to filmmaking and the Late 60s lifestyle he grew up with.Rick Dalton (DiCaprio) is washed up and out of his prime TV Western star with his long time stunt double Cliff Booth (Pitt) try to fit in and adjust to a changing Hollywood amid the 1960s counterculture.Dalton is the next door neighbor to the late Sharon Tate (Robbie) who he wishes to impress to save his career at its low point.The first two hours is a slice of life for every character while paying homage to vintage filmmaking and the rapidly changing 1960s. The last 40 minutes is simply classic Tarantino.All I have to say is get ready for a wild ride."
324," My favourite film of all time.
","Ive been seeing a lot of reviews on here claiming the film is slow with sparse action and some even saying its pretentious... and two of those things, yeah... kinda... but it is a film lovers wet dream.
Everything feels deliberate in this film. The pacing is slow, but it also builds the story minute by minute.. There's sparse action, but it isn't meant to be an action movie.
Is it pretentious?
I dont think so, Tarantino knows his craft and he poured everything he had into this one. He didnt do this for the sake of being artsy fartsy about it. Everything matters in this film, even the minute details that might seem like they were just thrown in.This is the kind of film in which every little movement of the camera has intention and meaning behind it.
It might be slow, it might be like a slice of life rather than a high octane action/drama, but it has those moments too. It presents the audience with every emotion under the sun to feel.
If you watch it expecting kill bill, youre not going to get that. Its a paced, measured and deliberate love letter to the golden age of hollywood.After seeing this film it became my favourite film of all time immediately.Now, i tried to watch this with my girlfriend today. She didnt take to it the way i did. We got about an hour in and she fell asleep.
Take from that what you want.I still think this is a 10/10 film."

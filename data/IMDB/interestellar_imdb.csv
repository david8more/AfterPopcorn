0," I waited 5 years to watch it again
","After watching this insane movie in the theatres back in 2014 I swore to god I will wait 5 years to watch it again so I get to forget it and experince the insanity it has again
This without doubt is THE BEST MOVIE EVER MADE"
1," Best movie I have seen in my life
","This movie was the best written, acted, visual effected, etc. movie. This movie was the best movie I have ever seen. I am a huge Christopher Nolan fan and this movie was his finest. Matthew McConaughey turned in his best performance of his lifetime. Anne Hathaway was an amazing supporting actress and compared to her performance in Les Miserables, I have no idea how she didn't get an Oscar for this. The visual effects were more than just Oscar worthy. They were pioneering. I have never seen anything like it. One thing I would recommend is having a little previous knowledge about space. Not like Einstein stuff though. I would recommend you see this movie as fast as you can if you are a Nolan fan or not. I give this movie a rating of 97 out of 100."
2," Excellent Movie
","I judge a movie by how long it takes me to realize I need the bathroom, how long the movie can hold my interest and how convincing the events unfolding are. Well, I watched this movie all the way through with no bathroom breaks. My interest was grabbed from the start and held all the way through. Being old enough, and lucky enough to have watched the premiere of 2001 A Space Odyssey - and viewed it several times since - of course I made comparisons, and there were a few, but this movie tells an excellent stand alone story that is both riveting and believable. I'm not going to give away any secrets but anyone who watches the last five minutes or so without a lump in their throat and a tear in their eye, well you're a critic, you're not enjoying the movie because you're too busy looking for bloopers and faults. Were there bloopers and faults? The darn movie was so riveting if there were any I didn't notice them!"
3," Glad i didn't watch the trailer
","Interstellar - ReviewCertain things in life are precious. Very precious. And so was the Film for me.Why you might ask?Well seldom do i get the chance where i find myself sitting in a cinema anxious and intrigued by what might come. In a time where trailers are omnipresent and going to the movies without having seen one seems unreasonable, outright stupid to some i had the magical chance to find myself in front of the IMAX on a cold November night with 2 tickets to Interstellar. My only knowledge was that Nolan directed it and McConaughey stars in it.The images were brilliant the acting was top notch and everything was blended together by Hans Zimmer and his Music. 169 minutes flew by me with my eyes fixed on the screen and my heart racing. And there it was.. The ending. I couldn't believe it . I was reliving, rethinking the movie while the credit scenes rolled enjoying the moment, the smell of popcorn, my comfortable seat and what do i see next to me? Ninety percent of the people in the cinema rushing outside after the first second of the credit scenes. .. .Well apparently people enjoy movies different than i do. Maybe i should start watching trailers again :)."
4," A visual and auditory marvel
","Interstellar is a movie like no other. Unlike many apocalyptic sci-fi films that feature advanced technology as the source of our destruction (ala The Terminator movies), it instead asserts that technology will save us.Not everyone in Interstellar recognizes the potential of advanced technology. Most dismiss it as a waste of time and resources, and not just old curmudgeons feel this way. Thoughtful, intelligent young characters share this sentiment. This belief gained steam following a world-wide blight that wiped out the vast majority of life on earth—crops and humans.Farming became paramount while advanced technology was deemed frivolous. Cooper (McConaughey) remains one of the few survivors who still appreciates the need for engineering. He feels like a man lost in time, until he stumbles into the headquarters of NASA (which had been operating in secret due to public disapproval). Here he meets others who realize that a return to our old ways is unsustainable and will ultimately lead to our demise. We need technology to save us. As Michael Caine, playing the brilliant (duh!) Professor Brand, eloquently tells Cooper, ""we were never meant to save the world. We were meant to leave it."" For a movie that won an Oscar for Best Visual Effects (and deservedly so) the sound stole the show. Hans Zimmer (Dark Knight Trilogy) unleashed a performance that was, quite appropriately, out of this world. Never have I seen a movie elevated so much by its score. The sound literally took my breath away. Forgive me for the next paragraph. I will gush irresponsibly about the magic that is this movie's sound. Skip it if you please. You have your warning.The music fueled every important scene. In every meaningful moment Zimmer's harmonies captivated watchers' attention in the way of a coach commanding a locker room with a pregame speech. The music elucidated those emotional scenes, particularly ones featuring Cooper and his daughter, in a way that no words or visual ques possibly could. I sat frozen, jaw agape, with tears pouring down my cheeks as the music completely overwhelmed my emotions. The sound penetrated my soul and reverberated through my body, flowing to my appendages, supplying me with life like a heartbeat pumping blood through my veins. The music was truly the life force of movie.Yes, we all witnessed a visual triumph, a daring creative wonder the likes of which we haven't encountered since Inception. Yes, nearly every actor's performance proved worthy of commendation. McConaughey is on fire. Chastain is blossoming into a star. At this point Michael Cain exudes such knowledge and wisdom by merely appearing on screen that if he were cast as Albert Einstein, people would wonder if the role were beneath him. All this considered, and the sound still towered over everything.I walked out of the theater believing that I had experienced something unique, something truly special. Interstellar inspires, it awes, and above all it entertains. I cannot ask for more than that."
5," The best film I have ever seen
",All is amazing. I can't describe anything. It's a film that leads you to think about yourself and your plans in your life. I am a real series/movies' lover and... This was awesome.
6," Nolan's masterpiece, one of the best sci-fi movie
","I have been a cinema lover for years, read a lot of reviews on IMDb and everywhere, and never found the right movie to write my first review. I always thought I would wait for THE movie.And this is IT!When I first heard that Nolan was preparing a sci-fi movie, I felt like a kid again, waiting for his Christmas gift under the tree. I knew it would become a classic. And I'm sure it will.First of all, it is incredibly beautiful to watch. Honestly, it was so beautiful that I felt like I was sucked into the movie. The way Nolan decided to show some scenes really remind me of 2001 A Space Odyssey (actually many things will probably remind you of this movie). We can feel the talent of Christopher Nolan, just by looking at the way it is filmed. The techniques he used contribute to create that visual environment in a believable way.The sound environment is just mesmerizing. It is a very important part of the movie, because some scenes take place in space, and Noland just found the right way to use sound. The soundtrack (made by the great Hans Zimmer) is breathtaking, epic, amazing, unreal. I could find a lot more adjectives to qualify it, but you have to hear it to understand how epic they are. These two important parts (image and sound) create a stunning atmosphere. You will forget you are in a movie theater, and you will be lost in space, sucked into the adventures of this new Space Odyssey, begging for more. It is a truly unique experience. I can say that I have never felt something like that in a movie theater (at least not for the past ten years).Then, of course, the cast. First of all, Matthew McConaughey. I discovered this actor in Tropic Thunder, but he didn't really convince me, though he was quite funny. Then I saw Dallas Buyers Club. Since that movie, I love him. In this movie... Well, he is the movie. I exaggerate a bit, since there are other great actors (some even unexpected with a special guest) who play extremely well. But he is just what was needed to feel the human part of the story (which is very important in Interstellar). He is capable of making us feel so many different emotions all along the story, as a father, as a human. Anne Hathaway was very convincing, all together the actors managed to create some harmony, which makes the human interactions credible. Caine, Chastaing and Affleck are a perfect choice. And then there is... The special guest, I will call him ""X"". His role, which could be seen as a minor role, is actually much more important than that. He proves, once again, that he is a great actor. Watch and see.And finally, the scenario/story. I won't spoil anything here; I'll just try to convince you how great it is. Nolan is known to revolutionize everything when he tries a new genre in cinema. Well, once again he did it. With The Dark Knight he revolutionized the superhero genre. With Interstellar he's revolutionizing the sci-fi genre in cinema. From what I heard, he worked with a physicist (in gravitational physics and astrophysics) to help him with that movie. And we can feel and see it. During the fifties, Asimov laid the foundations of modern science fiction. Lucas and Kubrick did the same in cinema. Today, Nolan is laying the new foundations of the genre in cinema, proving that cinema is still at the beginning of what can be done (brace yourselves my friends, we have not seen anything yet). Why? Well, simply because we only know a few things about space, some things can't be proved for the moment, so we can use theory, and make the best of it. That is exactly what Nolan did. He used theories that exist today, and made a movie about mankind, about pioneers, about humanity, about us.Because, in spite of all the sci-fi aspect, it is a story about humanity. McConaughey, Hathaway, and mainly ""X"", will managed to convince you about that.My rating for this movie can only be a 10, because in itself, it is a beginning for a new kind of cinema. It IS a classic. Those who say ""we can't compare this movie to 2001 Space Odyssey, nor can we compare Nolan to Kubrick"" are wrong. We can, and we should. Talented people don't live only in the past, some genius live today, among us. And Nolan is one of them. Many say that he is overrated. I truly don't think so. Only time will answer that.This is the sci-fi movie of the decade, and probably the best movie Nolan ever made. Just go for it, without a second thought."
7," I would rate 11/10
","I hadn't seen this but movie and caught it on a flight back from the DR. 
One of my favorite movies of all time. I would give the first half of the movie an 11/10, just completely enjoyed it as a sci fi/ thriller(in the sense of so much always being on the line). I loved the acting and just yeah, a great movie and one you should go see if you never have"
8," Mankind Achievement
",THIS IS A MANKIND ACHIEVEMENT.THE BEST MOVIE EVER MADE.IS ANYONE HAS DOUBT?
9," Interstellar : An open-hearted & mastered Human Odyssey
","The film begins by establishing at his own rhythm its ambitions: men overexploited land resources, which is why the only goal they have left is to survive. This life is not enough for Cooper, brilliantly played by McConaughey who gave body and soul to this character. But all of this wouldn't hold without the total control of Christopher Nolan, based on the languishing soundtrack by Hans Zimmer, the luminous and impenetrable photography of Hoyte Van Hoytema, and the sincerity of Nolan's directing. He manages to film the characters and to find the right cut at the right time, always in harmony with Hans Zimmer's soundtrack, to give the film an aspiring and inspiring dimension that went missing for many many years. Thus we are transported into the same cockpit that Cooper, we feel the same remorse that he can already feel, we feel the same gravity, and we feel the same fear of the unknown melted with the force of his will. All of this is brilliantly illustrated in a very simple directing choice, which from my point of view is the decisive impetus of the film: to directly jump from when Cooper leaves in his truck, leaving his family behind him, to Endurance taking off. This simple editing decision allows Nolan to give an original movement to his film, and the musical crescendo makes us physically feel the sentimental break between two parts of the film.You don't necessarily have to understand it immediately : The film will raise questions in you, such as : what is it to be a human being, is there some physical limitations to our humanity, how far could we be willing to go to determine knowledge, is there other dimensions that we can not access to, and above all: what is the nature of this intact and immutable bond that unites us to others wherever we are in the universe ? Is this bond only intelligible, or is it also tangible ? All these questions resonate in harmony in Nolan's Interstellar. Interstellar is itself a crescendo, increasing sensitivity and creativity. I use the term deliberately because it goes crescendo with the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer, which is one of the most beautiful music ever scored for a sci-fi movie. We are witnessing a perfect musical arrangement, a total symbiosis, a bit like the music of Gravity which had understood very well how to match the image and the rhythm of a sequence to its own musicality. Zimmer's crescendos are giving a new powerful breath to every new scene, whether it is in visually powerful & intense moments or in more intimate moments; it intrudes into our momentary feelings and sensations, and manages to extend them, sometimes almost to choking, before resting on the balance of the film frame along with our mind spell-bounded. I have seen all the talent of the director that I knew he was outside the norm, but whom I did not know his capacity to reinvent itself. Because this is it: Interstellar is not an action movie, not really a blockbuster, and it goes not entirely but mostly again the expectations of common people. It's much more than that. This is much more than just a sci-fi movie. It is unlike any of his previous films. Some hoped to see Interstellar as Christopher Nolan's best film, and they were disappointed that this was not the case. And indeed, THIS IS NOT THE BEST FILM of Christopher Nolan. Because in a way, IT IS HIS FIRST FILM. I'm not saying that Interstellar is not as good as his other films, it goes beyond all of them. But to me Interstellar is the first film of a new stage in Nolan's filmography ; it is a masterpiece as it the beginning of a work ahead. Interstellar is the proof that Nolan has finally managed, despite all the expectations that were placed on him after the success of The Dark Knight, to move away from his own reputation to create a personal work, original, humble, sincere and deeply, meticulously, measured.Now, in this third act of the film, it all comes to life with unparalleled strength. Nolan poses and answers questions that raise others. But he focuses his attention on the great mystery of love, that emotional bond that can unite men and sometimes separate them. But Nolan is the only one that can successfully speak of love from a being to another in a film that mainly takes place in a another galaxy. From my point of view, only Solaris by Steven Soderbergh (2002), unfortunately neglected by the audience, was able to accomplish that. Interstellar is based on a premise which is the following : from terrestrial dust to the depths of space and time, we can never be separated from who we are as individuals and as a species, as we always leave a part of ourselves ""behind"" us. In other words, I could say that this is a human story, and even if we go as far as we want to, if we travel through the universe believing that we can be detached of the one we are fond of, we will only get closer to them. Because the separation, and thus the distance and time, can only ultimately reinforce the relationship between the people who really love each other. Because it is going to the end of the world, when we reach the end of ourselves, that we reach the singularity of the ""black hole beyond the horizon"" * : it is our humanity. No, I wasn't been able to find any bad flaws in the film. Not one, and I'm still looking. After all, Interstellar is like gravity, ""all it takes is a little push ! ""*you'll have to see the movie to figure that one out.Félix Tardieu, November 1st, 2014"
10," The best of all Time
","There is not even a single day I don't think of this movie, it's scenes , it has a profound impact on me and it shall remain with me forever."
11," A Visually Monumental And Thoughtful Sci-Fi Epic
","I was extremely lucky to get the chance to see this film upon its first day release, before entering the cinema, my expectations were already high, after all, this was a film from the cinematic genius who brought us the likes of 'Inception' and 'The Dark Knight', to summarise the following review in a single sentence: I left the cinema in extreme awe from the visual masterpiece I had just viewed. A film that explores the psychological and emotional state of a man whose life revolves around his family, 'Interstellar' is a thrilling and thought-provoking film that boasts an intellectual story masterfully written by the Nolan brothers. Whilst there seems to have been influence from films like '2001: A Space Odyssey' and 'Apollo 13', 'Interstellar' is unique in its own way. Whilst the subject may be hard to comprehend at times, it can't be denied how visually monumental and thoughtful Christopher Nolan's epic science fiction masterpiece is, and can easily be named the best film of this year and possibly one of the greatest science fiction films to have ever graced the screen. A sheer brilliant feat of cinema."
12," An Emotional, Beautiful Journey into the Unknown
","(This is both a review of the film, and an assertion of Christopher Nolan's filmmaking style)There have been many reviewers and critics alike that have high praise for the film (the visual effects, the acting, the music), but say how it's not Christopher Nolan's best directed film. This is where i personally would have to disagree. Before i get into it, though, i'll talk about Interstellar a bit.Interstellar is truly a sci-fi epic like no other. To compare said film to '2001: A Space Odyssey' isn't just a disservice, but unnecessary. The films are almost nothing alike, simply sharing small plot elements. Also, Stanley Kubrick's vision of Arthur C. Clarke's sci-fi epic wasn't to ponder the philosophical questions that accompanied the story, but to make art, and art is was, and is. With Interstellar, Mr. Nolan set out to make his most personal and emotional film to date about love and time (time being a recurring theme throughout all of Nolan's films). But it's so much more than that too. There are no words to express the epic journey Nolan takes us on in the film, but needless to say, it's tear-jerking and emotional throughout. The acting is top-notch, especially McConaughey, who gives (I would say) his most emotional performance yet. But the actor who stole the show in a few scenes (one in particular, when they're on an alien planet) was David Gyasi as Romilly, one of the astronauts aboard the Endurance, their spacecraft. The musical score from Hans Zimmer is, without a doubt, his best and most influential work to date, helping drive the film's bold and breath-taking vision (the church organ helped significantly). The visual effects are easily the best to date as well, and of the year. To see a black hole created through visual effects in such a way, with pages theoretical equations provided by Kip Thorne (theoretical physicist, of whom's work inspired the film's genesis); what you see in the film is the most realistic depiction of a black hole, and even offered new insight to accretion discs surrounding the anomalies. But even everything else, from the alien planets to the Endurance, the visuals always look real. Then, there's the writing. I would definitely have to say this has some of the best dialogue i've ever heard in a sci-fi movie, and the script continually pours or oozes emotion, keeping the audience tethered to the film.Now, about Mr. Nolan. Don't just look at Nolan, but look at his films. Some say Inception would be his masterpiece, while others would say it's The Dark Knight, or Memento. But honestly, every single film Christopher Nolan has directed is a masterpiece not of its genre, but of Nolan. Following is his quiet masterpiece, not the film that put Mr. Nolan on the map as a phenomenal director, but one people visited or revisited after becoming accustomed to Nolan, after seeing Memento, what could be called his breakout masterpiece. Then, right after, he directed the remake of the Norwegian thriller, Insomnia. This, too, could be considered a masterpiece, even if a remake. Then, we were given his take on the Batman universe, starting with Batman Begins, the origin masterpiece. Then, there's The Prestige, adapted from the novel of the same name, which can be called his dark masterpiece. The Dark Knight, his bold masterpiece; Inception, his complex masterpiece, and The Dark Knight Rises, his flawed masterpiece. Now, we have Interstellar, his emotional or personal masterpiece.This is just my looking at Nolan and his films, but whatever your thoughts are, you can't deny Interstellar is one hell of a journey. He certainly is one of the best filmmakers of our time, and of all time. I can't wait to see what he does next, but i'm not sure it will be as emotionally powerful as Interstellar."
13," 'Interstellar'
","'Interstellar' was incredible. The visuals, the score, the acting, were all amazing. The plot is definitely one of the most original I've seen in a while. Most of the critic reviews have said that some bits are a little too unbelievable, but I have to disagree. Yes, there were some parts that were definitely in the ""fi"" part of sci-fi. But the thing is, 'Interstellar' deals with concepts that we know very little about. We have no idea what the 4th or 5th dimension is like, or what it would be like to go through a wormhole or a black hole. I don't think it's fair to call something unbelievable, when we have absolutely no idea what WOULD be believable in those circumstances. Either way, excellent writing from the Nolan brothers. The visuals were outstanding, and will no doubt be nominated for an Oscar. The performances were excellent, though nothing Oscar worthy, as is the case with most of Nolan's films ('The Dark Knight' being the obvious exception). Hans Zimmer's score was amazing and blended perfectly with the film. All in all, 'Interstellar' is an excellent movie, which I personally think is Nolan's most beautiful film to date."
14," A Love Story Against The Backdrop Of A Grand Interstellar Travel
","Love is the one thing that transcends time and space... New creation of Christopher Nolan's genius, whose name is now known to everyone. His films are waiting with a special look, because it offers something that every day, unfortunately, less and less can be found in the world of mass cinema - an interesting spectacle, filled with meaning, ideas and emotions. At this time, Christopher decided to send us not to the world of dreams, and even not on the dark streets of Gotham City. No, now he send us to the journey to, and perhaps beyond the boundaries of the possible and impossible, through the curvature of space and time, in other worlds. And you won't forget this trip, this can be assured. I was madly waiting for Interstellar's release. And then, finally, I was able to see this Beauty - at the premiere in my coutry on October, 29. It was incredibly exciting. It was a delight. It was unforgettable. It was gorgeous. Nolan once again amazes the viewer's imagination by his painting. Journey to the brink of infinity, the line where humanity has never set, acts as either the first-born purpose and a background of emotional history about the father and the daughter. A loving father who mankind need to help, but that he should leave his children, and a loving daughter who doesn't want to let her dad in the infinity darkness. Starting from the very first frame and ending with the closing credits, a new picture of Nolan will absorb you completely, forcing stare at the screen during the whole action, because it's all so exciting and interesting that escape becomes physically impossible. No, this three hours won't fly quickly for you. You'll feel every emotion, every event, every character. You will not look how the main characters travel through the universe, because the movie experience in this film is so excellent that you will be on board of ""Endurance"" starship and travel between the worlds with the main characters by yourself.The emotional core of this story is the relationship of Matthew McConaughey's character and his daughter - Mackenzie Foy' and Jessica Chastain' character. And the acting work of these three artists in ""Interstellar"" impress the most. McConaughey was acting really great, and this is one of the most emotional, if not the most emotional role of his life. All the drama and tragedy of the relationship of father and daughter in this film will not leave anyone indifferent. Anne Hathaway, Wes Bentley, Michael Caine, Casey Affleck, Ellen Burstyn and other actors also coped with their roles and presented the film's supporting characters very realistic. I would particularly like to note a small but important in this story role of Matt Damon, a character who has received quite memorable. If we talk about the characters, it should be noted also two robots that accompanied our heroes in this difficult journey. One of them adds a touch of humor in the film, which mitigates constantly depressing, dramatic, and sometimes really dark atmosphere.The script of the film is very well combined the history of space exploration and the relationship between Cooper and Murph. The story is complex and complicated, is based on real scientific theories by Kip Thorne, and indeed contains a reference to the ""Space Odyssey"" and other sci-fi pictures. This story about true love, about loyalty, forgiveness, fraud, hard decisions, and much more. And it is designed so that leaves a lot of room for the imagination of the viewer. It's also possible to notice some structure allusion to another Nolan's work - Inception. The story and visuals are combined just perfectly in Interstellar.Hans Zimmer's score, written by him on the basis of only one letter from Nolan, hold the key: ""Once we become parents, we can't help but look at ourselves through the eyes of our children"", deserves a special praise. On this basis, Hans managed to write just incredible soundtrack that perfectly harmonizes with the history and the visual side of the picture. And this work of the composer is really different from the previous ones. It is executed in a different style from another subject in its base. Very impressive work, which will be pleasantly listened again and separate from the film itself. Visual range of the picture is incredibly beautiful and circuses. The ""Endurance"" itself, new worlds, insanely beautiful and mysterious space, wormholes, black holes, and travel through them, folds of time and space are arranged so that is simply breathtaking. I would like to thank all those who contributed to the creation of a visual of this film. It must be seen. That mastery with which this is done, not just words. In the visual pattern also has some references to the Kubrick's ""Odyssey"", and they are pleasing to the eye.Many thanks to Christopher Nolan for having given us such an incredible movie, which once again proved to us that the cinema is Nolan's life. ""Interstellar"" is a film that wins the hearts of the audience not only with its sci-fi splendor, but also an emotional story that lies at its very heart. This film is not only about the discoveries, space exploration and the final frontier of mankind, but also about the relationship of father and daughter, who were in a difficult situation in life when one has to leave the other in the name of a goal that can not be underestimated. So, with what Nolan's genius unfolds before us this action is beyond praise. Combining the story, filled with not only real science fiction, but the true human values ​​and emotions, outstanding and very emotional performances, breathtaking visuals, epic and dramatic soundtrack, Christopher Nolan breathed the life into this film by his directing to create something truly masterpiece again. ""Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night... Rage, Rage Against The Dying Of The Light."""
15," It's one of those movies
","The ones that you still think of weeks even months later. The ones that make you think and leave you breathless. The ones that inspire you to want to change your life after a mere two and a half hours.I watched this movie the first time over a month and a half ago and it still crops up in my mind. The thought of space travel excites me along with countless others and this movie has literally made me rethink my life choices and pushed me into wanting to become an astronaut. As childish as it sounds, its true, because its one of those movies. Interstellar has become my new favourite movie by far.Bravo Nolan what a great human bean"
16," A familiar journey to the unknown, albeit a grand one
","So last night I got the chance to see the early screening of Christopher Nolan's Interstellar. The film I've been waiting so much from the early days of the shooting. How did it fare? Here's my take:To avoid any tl;dr risk, let me get this straight from the very beginning, Interstellar is one goddamnedly good film, it gets you to the edge of your seat, it soars, it warps, it rips your brain senseless. It's that good.Interstellar is a story about the earth dying, with its soil no longer able to sustain crops other than corn, and of course, it will lead to the extinction of humanity. Our hero is an ex-NASA test pilot named Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), a typical ordinary-guy-in-an-extraordinary- situation everyman who's also a dedicated family man, especially toward his daughter Murphy (named after the Murphy's Law). In an all-too-Armageddon style our hero gets invited by the (publicly) defunct NASA to become humanity's last hope in finding a new home, for they have found a wormhole near Saturn (2001, anyone?) which will warp the astronauts to another galaxy in quest of a habitable planet. Solid and compact premise, although it's been used before.For seasoned filmgoers, there are many similar elements (although it's understandable) with Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) and Robert Zemeckis' Contact (1997). In a sense that this is not a bang-bang-shoot-shoot-blow-em-up sci-fi, but more of a slow-burning, metaphysical sci-fi which gets you to think about your place in the universe and your exact place in time.Similarity with 2001 and Contact is never a bad thing, but it becomes a wee bit too predictable, although Nolan is a smart enough director in providing the final (a very sentimental one, I should say) twist in the story. The visuals in this film is majestic, everything is shot to a meticulously calculated level, Nolan-style. The space scenes are serenely suspenseful just like Cuaron's Gravity, but unlike the documentary feel of Gravity, there's a real gusto and pace to these scenes. You should also be prepared for the (for some, maybe) unexpected third act, it is Nolan's most sentimental and humane moment to date. And this is why Interstellar is more than just a science-fiction, it is a human drama intertwined in space and time loop.One thing that Nolan gets a bit wrong is the narrative. Nolan was never a 'warm' director, his films are filled with brilliant ideas and flair but it feels cold, it maybe suits Memento and The Dark Knight but in Interstellar he seems to have been lost in determining which of the interpersonal drama or the sci-fi that will be Interstellar's forte. The result is a rather incongruous script, intermittently cutting off the excitement of the previous scene and so on. But it is a forgivable sin, for the good is a lot more than the bad in this monumental film. At the end of the day, all I can say is that Interstellar is a grand film. It is monolithic, thoughtful, sentimental, sophisticated, visceral but also with its flaws. I wouldn't say it's Nolan's best work to date, but I daresay that this is one of the best science fiction ever released.After watching Interstellar, do yourself a favor and get lost in space and time and go back in time to see Contact (1997) and 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) to further wonder and wander into the realms of the unknown.Because sometimes it is the unknown that fascinates us, frightens us and brings out the best in us."
17," Epic in every way!
","Just watched Interstellar in imax 70mm. Science Fiction fans can read on, everyone else can skip. Movie is a visual masterpiece. Like his earlier movies, Christopher Nolan once again proved, how big a movie can be! There were some shots,which made audience go crazy..Some scenes were as epic as 2001: A Space Odyssey. Do not go into the theatre expecting an action packed cerebral thriller. This one is not for action fans. At times, movie go highly sentimental( Matthew McConaughey does what he is best in and supposed to). I recommend this movie to all the Sci-Fi fans out there, make sure you go in group of sci-fi nuts!! Do not go with the hype..Go, sit back and enjoy. Just like Inception, this movie will be known as great after few months(I know people who said Inception was a crap when it released, and after few months rating it 10/10 in IMDb :D). I don't wanna spoil anything(If you want PM me). Also, make sure you go to the best theatre close to you. (If you loved Donnie Darko, 2001: A Space Odyssey, this is the one for you, Get ready to get mind blown!!) Interstellar Movie is EPIC in all sense!!"
18," A movie made for me
","The most amazing thing about this movie is its pioneering spirit. They look at night sky and see a map of foreign worlds that need to be visited. The movie presents lot of mysteries of the world in visually fascinating way. Those robots there are amazing as well, complete opposite of Marvin from Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. I love them. The emotional layer is as great as it gets. You may very well find yourself crying possibly more than once. Finally the imagination was mind blowing rolling around the edges of the things you are yet willing to accept as possible. It all feels very real like you are right there travelling across the Universe encountering strangest parts of physics."

","A lot has been said and heard about this movie but none of it comes even close to the experience of watching it. It has all the elements of a Nolan movie and just like in all of his other movies he decides to go a bit further. This time, he went a little too far. The story behind the movie has it's flaws. There really is no explanation of what happened/is happening. Instead you are given fragments in the first half of the movie hoping one will put all the pieces together. All in all, the first part seems a bit rushed and leaves you wondering if more could have been told. But, since the real story is not why the travel is necessary but the travel itself once the crew is off, the story really kicks in. The main part of the movie gives a great ride, pumps your blood with adrenaline from time to time and gets you emotional pretty often. The problem I personally had was that the story taking place simultaneously on Earth was less shown than I expected. A different approach was expected but that did not stop Chastain from giving the best role in the movie. The last part of the movie is dynamic and filled with problems real people would have if found in a situation like that. But the explanation given at the very end was a bit to much for me. I heard that this was called ""the most scientifically accurate movie"" and that physicist around the world fought over the fact was that true or not. Nevertheless, way too much theoretical physics in the end. Since I love SF movies I am willing to look past the over- the-top science part, but what really got to me was that it was predictable. From the very moment I saw a black hole in the movie I put two and two together and that kinda ruined it for me a little. Regarding the acting, as I said before, Chastain gave the most powerful performance in the movie. She doesn't have much screen time, but she sure knows how to use it. The two that actually lead the movie - McConaughey and Hathaway were brilliant. McConaughey did a little better job handling the emotions of a father with the responsibilities of a team leader and the savior of mankind. His performance was outstanding. Hathaway was good, decent, without a single word that can be said against her, but for a movie like this, that is almost completely on the shoulders of the actors, she should have done more. The others did a good job, particularly Casey Affleck who's character was a grand comparison to Chastain's. The music given it was done by the mastermind Hans Zimmer was spectacular. Just the right notes, just the right timing, just the right music. His understanding of what movies should sound like is amazing. All in all, Interstellar is a magnificent movie. It is a type of movie Nolan does best. It has all the elements of being a classic like Kubrick's 2001: a space odyssey, it comes really close to being the new space odyssey, and it will not perish with time. Still, this might be a bit too much for the average moviegoer, a lot has to be digested here, it is not a simple or easy movie to watch. But, if your braincells don't shut off and you don't expect another Die Hard movie, you will appreciate this masterpiece."
20," time travel= relativity =space equilibrium= Nolan's grand space masterpiece
","chris Nolan a delivered another original story with with less special effects its more old school stuff with flight simulators done instead of geeen screens with space painted on the outside everything you see in this movie is real as your going to get so here starts the story of a farmer called cooper played by Matthew mconnaughey another Oscar performance who was a N.A.S.A pilot and his family he finds out that there is a problem with earth food sources and stumbles upon a plan to save earth and t leave earth for another world with his daughter he loves and his daughter tuned into other worldly scientific things that I wont explain you have to see this to understand the films relevance on finding a solution to the worlds problems there is a solution in here house were signs are there but I wont make sense until the end he has really turned the corner in his career what a RenascenceFirst of all, it is incredibly beautiful to watch. Honestly, it was so beautiful that I felt like I was sucked into the movie. The way Nolan decided to show some scenes really remind me of contact and parts of inception you see in this movie ca feel the talent of Christopher Nolan, just by looking at the way it is filmed. The techniques he used contribute to create that visual environment in a believable way.The sound environment is just mesmerizing. It is a very important part of the movie, because some scenes take place in space, and Noland just found the right way to use sound. The soundtrack (made by the great Hans Zimmer) is breathtaking, epic, amazing, unreal. I could find a lot more adjectives to qualify it, but you have to hear it to understand how epic they are. you think how loud this film is you think you ware a astronautMatthew, In this movie... Well, he is the movie. he orchestrates this film that everybody else feeds of his power so much that everyone around him gets better. But Matthew is just what was needed to feel the human part of the story (which is very important in Interstellar). He is capable of making us feel so many different emotions all along the story, as a father, as a human. Anne Hathaway was very convincing, all together the actors managed to create some harmony, which makes the human interactions credible. Caine, Chastaing and Affleck are a perfect choice. And then there is... The special guest who is mischievous in a minor role , is actually much more important than that. He proves, once again, that he is a great actor. Watch and see. and a sarcastic computer really a bit bizarre in space but this computer does come in handy in a important scene And finally, the scenario/story. I won't spoil anything here; I'll just try to convince you how great it is. Nolan is known to revolutionize everything when he tries a new genre in cinema. Well, once again he did it. With The Dark Knight he revolutionized the superhero genre. With Interstellar he's revolutionizing the sci-fi genre in cinema. he worked with a physicist in gravitational physics and astrophysics to help him with this movie. And we can feel and see just as Spielberg did in the 80s Nolan is doing it now Today, Nolan is laying the new foundations of the genre in cinema, proving that cinema is still at the beginning of what can be done (brace yourselves my friends, we have not seen anything yet). Why? Well, simply because we only know a few things about space, some things can't be proved for the moment, so we can use theory, and make the best of it. That is exactly what Nolan did. He used theories that exist today, and made a movie about mankind, about pioneers, about humanity, about us.whole journey that they thought was fraught with danger and the unknown as they have received messages from across time and space to realize that they had the answers after all it was just his daughter love to figure out what the lead scientist life work (Michael Caine) was about My rating for this movie can only be a 10,this film does not feel like 3hrs of moving space enthralling epic masterpiece with a beating heart of love and time and bending space time from a to b to meet his family across the universe This is the sci-fi movie of the decade, and probably the best movie Nolan ever made.if you like thinking about logic you might just come way thinking that this earth can be saved if we take what Nolan was taking about and not just taking the earth for granted Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night... Rage, Rage Against The Dying Of The Light."""
21," I literally said to myself: this is a perfect film
","During the emergency docking scene, I said to myself: ""this movie is perfect"". I couldn't fund a flaw. The story is enthralling and you feel the anxiety of the people who are struggling to survive and help others to do the same thing. There is a gravity to their work and they each show it well.My favorite genre us sci fi. This is plausible scifi, which is my favorite subset of scifi. McConnahey is amazing as usual. The young actress who plays his daughter seems like a break out star who we will def see again.The music is so good I'm learning a guitar transcription of some of the songs on the finger style guitar we site.I've seen Interstellar 7 or 8 times. I'll watch it regularly for years to come. It's a classic of our time much like Inglorious Basterds."
22," The GENIUS shocks the world by another unique innovation..!!
","(((WOW)))...!!!It's almost impossible to put in words, but we have to try and give everyone what he truly deserve.In my modest opinion, Interstellar is the best Sci-Fi in human history. Believe it or not. It's the simple and the complicated, It's the usual and the different, It's the mind and the heart, It's an emotional and psychological journey through the unknown which has its own stunning visuals. It's an original story and thought-provoking masterpiece.Every single time with him, you just got crazy about his ideas, astonished by his mind games and inspired when he talks to the heart.Back then, he was an ambitious young director. And with his capabilities made his own way straight through the world. Now, he is an icon and a legend of directing. He is Christopher Nolan...Really guys, what's wrong with this guy ?!! what's going on inside his head ?!!It's our job to honor the honorable. Please, Just keep the rating UP, why ? Because Chris. and Interstellar deserve it."
23," Going brilliantly (but very LOUDLY) into the dark
","Wowser! This Christopher Nolan film was presaged with such marketing hype that I went in with pretty low and cynical expectations. But I was frankly blown away with it.Just about everyone raves about Christopher Nolan's work, and you look back at his Filmography and it makes for a pretty impressive resume: from Memento via the (rather over-hyped imho) Dark Knight Batman series-reboot through to Inception, one of my favourite films of all time. For me, Interstellar is right up there with Inception for thought-provoking, visually spectacular and truly epic cinema.We start in familiar 'Day after Tomorrow"" territory, with mankind having in some way – not entirely explained – messed up the planet. As I understood it (and the film probably does require multiple watches with – see comments below – subtitles=on) the rather clever premise is that the world's food supplies are being progressively destroyed by a vindictive 'blight'. This delivers the double whammy of destroying mankind's provisions but also, by massive reproduction of the organism, progressively depleting the Earth's oxygen. For some reason – again, which I didn't get on first viewing – this is accompanied by massive dust storms. It is a morbid bet as to what is going to get the mid-West population first: starvation, lung disease or suffocation. Matthew McConnaughey plays the widowed Cooper, an ex-NASA drop out turned farmer given the opportunity by mission-leader Professor Brand (an excellent Michael Caine) to pilot a NASA mission. The goal is to punch through a mysterious wormhole in space where they suspect, through previous work, that a new home for mankind could be found.The first part of the film is set on and around Cooper's farm, setting in place one of the emotional wrenches at the heart of the film: that Cooper in volunteering for the mission and having to leave behind his elderly father (John Lithgow, again superb) and young children Murph (aged 10) and Tom (aged 15) whilst recognising that danger for him comes not just from the inherent risks involved but from the theory of relativity that could change everything, time-wise, for when he returns.Cooper is supported on the mission by a team of scientists including Brand's daughter played by a love-struck Anne Hathaway, who again shows she can act.To say any more would spoil what is a voyage of visual and mental discovery. (However, I would add that it is good to see that the character that plays my namesake Dr Mann (in a surprise cameo) is equally good looking! LOL).In terms of plus points, where do I start? The visuals are utterly stunning. Whilst reminiscent in places of Kubrick's ""stargate"" from 2001, the similarity is only passing. The film adds a majesty and scale to space that surpasses wonder. Elsewhere there are some interesting visual effects: this might have just been me of course, but after the dramatic launch there was something about the camera moves during the first scenes of weightlessness that made me feel genuinely nauseous.Equally stunning is Hans Zimmer's score which is epic and (in places) very VERY loud. The film certainly doesn't ""go quietly into the night""! When matching the noise of the score/choir to the sound effects in the launch sequence the combination is ear-bleedingly effective. This must be a strong contender for the soundtrack Oscar for 2014. One quibble, again 2001 related, is that Zimmer uses the last chord of Also Sprach Zarathustra in the score sufficiently often that one hopes Richard Strauss's estate receives some royalties! The acting is top notch: I've already mentioned Caine and Lithgow, but McConnaughey, Hathaway and Jessica Chastain are all great. A particular shout-out should go to Mackenzie Foy as the young Murph, who is magnetically charismatic and just brilliant in the role.Above all, Nolan's direction is exquisite. The film has a slow build on earth (which adds to the lengthy running time) but defines the characters and primes the plot perfectly. And some of the editing cuts – again, Cooper's farm departure/launch sequence overlay is a great example – are superb in building the mood and the tension.I've decided that I am an extremely tough reviewer and for me a 10 star film is a rarity indeed. Where I could have knocked off a star was in some of the dialogue on the soundtrack, which was pretty inaudible in places: McConnaughey in particular with his general mumbling and strong southern accent is indecipherable in places. I look forward to the DVD subtitles. And one of the character's dying words – delivering a key plot point in the film – was completely lost to me (but thankfully later restated). Whilst the expansive plot is highly ambitious, the end of the film, playing fast and loose with physics I fear, requires a gravity-defying suspension of belief (although I guess the same could equally be said of 2001: A Space Odyssey).However, the film has stayed so firmly lodged in my mind for 24 hours I will make a rare exception to my rating 'rule'. Overall, this is a top-notch Sci-Fi film. And a final word: PEOPLE THIS IS A MUST SEE ON THE BIG SCREEN!

24," ""In order for man to move forward, they must leave something behind.""
","-Plot- The year is unknown, but most likely close to present time. The Earth is running out of resources and a group of underground NASA workers seek the help of Engineer/Astronaut turned Farmer Mr. Cooper in taking a journey across the Galaxy and through a wormhole in hopes of a future for mankind on the other side.That is the gist of the exposition of the plot. It's mostly quite clear what this movie is about through previews. On paper this sounds like a typical sci-fi plot, but Chris Nolan executes it like never before. The movie seems to be getting more mixed reviews from critics compared to his other films, and I think I have an explanation. Nolan and his team had too much faith in it's audience. The movie is full of science and dialogue strongly textured with physics theories. The talk of wormholes and Black holes are key to the movie. But I know that many will be left confused even with the explanations of what is going on to make everything in the film scientifically possible. After all, Physicist Kip Thorne was a consultant for the movie! I found it quite educational, interesting, but also over done at times. A good majority of people who watch this movie will be turned off by the abundance of scientific talk throughout the movie. I personally loved it and was never lost, but I could understand why many people were frustrated with the constant turns in the plot and overlong length. I found this movie to be amazing. Sure, at times the dialogue was hard to even understand. There was a scene where a major character is dying, and as he speaks his last words, it's almost impossible to decipher what is said. It was also almost unintentionally humorous. But that was a small price to pay and I'm sure the subtitles of the Blu Ray release will save that scene for me. The directing and cinematography are gorgeously done. The camera angles really bring the movie to life. Simple shots from the point of view of the rear of a truck or spaceship never looked so amazing. The visuals were undeniably beautiful whether the setting was in space, on the foreign planet or even the decaying Earth. The music of the film by Hans Zimmer deserves so much recognition! I will even say it was better than the score for Inception. It really increased the tension and pushed for emotional heartache in many parts of the film. There are many tense scenes that will have you holding on along with the characters in the movie and a good portion of this effect is due to the musical score! The acting was top class. Matthew M gave one of the greatest human performances in history as Mr. Cooper. I seriously think it was better than his Dallas Buyers Oscar Winning performance. I really hope he gets recognition for this. There are more than a few scenes that will make even the most cold hearted person feel like crying. He was just amazing. Anne Hathaway gave a stunning emotional performance as the flawed Bland. Jessica Chastain has a few strong moments as well. There is a scene regarding her character breaking down which will definitely make your eyes water. The supporting cast all do justice to the movie too, but Matthew and Jessica gave the best performances without a doubt.In a way, this movie resembles Inception in certain areas. Inception had a hint of relativity in it with the time differences between the dreams, the real world and limbo. Interstellar adds to that with the inclusion of a planet in the other galaxy in which every hour is equal to 7 years outside of its atmosphere. In Inception, a central character is left behind and lost in the limbo world with its major difference of time. In Interstellar, a central character is left behind in the other galaxy to find a new home while the other leaves to help the current home adjust until then. In Inception, a central character is old for a moment in limbo at the end due to the difference in time relativity. In Interstellar, the time relativity affects the entire human race as the astronauts are in the other galaxy. In both movies, the main character has left behind children and longs to be reunited. Inceptions main character doesn't want to see his children's faces until they are truly reunited. But in Interstellar, he holds on to the image of their faces as a survival tactic. This movie is full of Christopher/Jonathan Nolan-isms. Overall, I think that this movie should be seen in theaters on the big screen if you have the chance. It was a true experience. Be sure to be attentive and to clear your bladder first though. It will make you think. At times it might make you check your watch, but please endure and you will be treated to one of the most intriguing films of all time. Even if you think you didn't like the film, there is no doubt that you will be thinking about the contents of the plot and beauty of the visuals long after the credits roll."
25," Thought-provoking, mind-enriching, and heart wrenching sci-fi drama.
","'Interstellar' takes off by constituting its soaring ambitions right at the very first few sequences of the film: humanity is struggling to survive in a barely habitable Earth, already at the brink of total destruction. Earth and its resources is down to its last few moments, but when a wormhole, a medium that enables space time-travel beyond known limits, is discovered, scientists and ordinary men gather together, to begin an exploration that would take time-traveling through different worlds, in man's desperate search for humanity's place among the stars.To fully understand 'Interstellar', its premise and its accuracy, may require repetitive thinking, research, and a certain level of intellect—perhaps the same level Nolan asked in 'Inception'. But the film does not necessarily ask its audience to right away fully understand it, instead it begs you to feel it, to experience its dilemmas and tragedies and go through the same threads of emotion tangled up within the web of humanity's last possible moments, and the relationship between a widowed father and his children already leaning toward an anticipated end. Nolan's made sure that even the film's ideas are too far-fetched and may seem resting on towering intellectual grounds, it would nonetheless connect to its audience by delivering its message through emotionally-charged tales of human relationships, tangible enough to be felt and experienced.At its core, is retired NASA engineer, Cooper (McConaughey) and his relationship with his children—most strikingly with his daughter, Murph. Cooper's emotional journey—the decision he has to make whether to leave his family behind or join the quest to search for a new habitable planet—alone, serves as an effective vessel to transport the audience from Earth, right from the moment the spacecract 'Endurance' takes off from the ground, to the unknown limits of the cosmos. McConaughey delivers a stunning and highly-commendable performance, and while I can't say its his best, as I've managed to have seen only a few of his movies, I can certainly say it's one of the best I've seen from any actor, so far, and he may be owing that to Nolan's impeccable direction. McConaughey's incredibly brilliant portrayal of a loving father places him at the center of the story. There are plenty of nail-biting sequences here depicting his devastation after the choices he needed to make and still has to take, and in each one, he never fails to effectively convey whatever emotion the sequence requires him to deliver.Nolan's mastery of his craft screams in deafening volumes through his unblemished capacity to explore and raise the layers of the film's characters and put their stories in right places and in valid highlights within the film, and that works best with the help of brilliant musical score orchestrated by the equally impeccable Hans Zimmer. Added with breath-taking cinematography and spectacular visual effects, together, these elements, make 'Interstellar' capable of weaving a human story powerful enough to intrude through our delicate emotional senses, delve into our humanity and still go beyond that. Nolan's managed to tread through the film's seemingly absurd scope and ambitions without losing focus on the one powerful element that seems to keep the film's aspects bonded together: LOVE. As chiché as it may sound, that may be the only thing that is right away understood and easily felt in the movie. There are a lot of questions raised, and each one poses another, but none of which really requires immediate answer, and by not losing grasp of the mystery of love, and the power it can deliver to make human connections tighter and even closer amidst the ever widening physical distance between the characters in the film, Nolan comes out victorious in making the audience feel and understand 'Interstellar' and have its questions answered, in a way that doesn't necessarily oblige us to just think, but also to make our emotions work as well, so we can have the experience the film wants us to go through.Sure, it can't be perfect, I myself noticed that it lacks focus with its narrative (this either because I find it hard to solve Nolan's puzzle-like construction of the story—LOL—or the narrative' s really not just that good. If you have seen Memento and Inception, the construction here is somehow similar as those two) and some respected critics even argue this one can't be Nolan's best, and I haven't seen all his works yet, either, but for me, it really isn't that hard to put this on the list of the best sci-fi movies I've seen so far. Nolan has put up together a perfect ensemble of outstanding actors, whose powerful performances, IMO, are enough to cover the flaws. Not a single bit of every actor's potential is put into waste, here; everyone has a star to shine in this universe Nolan created. Hans Zimmer's music seems to never go out of sync, in fact it almost always goes in harmony with the dramatic highlights of the film. Visual effects is never less than top-notch; the imagery presented in this film is utterly jaw-dropping, so expect to have your breath being repeatedly taken away by the frequent outburst of colors effectively employed to establish distinctions between the dimensions. All those elements are satisfyingly sufficient to create the deciding impulse needed to bring the movie to where it aims to arrive.'Interstellar' is a thought-provoking and mind-enriching motion picture, a grand and brilliantly depicted visual spectacle not bereft of human emotions, one of the best of its genre in a very long time. If this movie gets proclaimed as a classic in the coming decades, that definitely isn't going to come out as a surprise.This Christopher Nolan film deserves my 10 stars. :)"
26," You will love it or hate it
","OK, I've just seen Interstellar and I can tell it's one of those movies that you either love or hate.Personally I loved it and probably I'm going to watch it again to process it a little bit more. It's not a simple movie, maybe that was already clear, is a Nolan's film.Matthew McConaughey does a great job by portraying Cooper. The most touching scenes are those between his character and Mackenzie Foy, who plays the younger version of Murph, Jessica Chastain character. Either it seems to be an ""Outer Space Film"" is more about human relations and how important is for us to be linked with others. Even it's a long movie, 169 minutes, I didn't felt it that long or tedious. The director managed to keep us engaged through the whole film. The experience on IMAX in 70mm film. The image quality perceived was superb, now I get why Christopher Nolan and other directors are fighting to keep film alive. I had the opportunity to watch it at the Chinese theatre and was a great experience, my first time in that theatre. The staff from the theatre even told us that Nolan himself watched several scenes of the movie in that theatre to ""calibrate"" the experience. Which is very cool. Well, I encourage you to go and watch Interstellar to see of you love or hate it."
27," WTH, how a movie could be like this
",After watching it i was paralyze for 3 hours. pure Epic!
28," Not Just A Class Apart...One of the Best 'Sci-Fi' flicks of all time!
","Bad-ass... is the adjective which I choose to type the first word of this review. As I left the theater I was not only spellbound, but I was also sulking about the fact that the movie had ended.The movie has a slow pace at the beginning, but not really boring. Steady and unique in its nature, I did feel that this movie might end up like last years blockbuster 'Gravity' starring Sandra Bullock and George Clooney. With every minute that passed, I could feel the importance of time, which let my prejudice drain away. With twists and turns, but not brain-spraining at all, it did make emotions come at par with adventure.Great acting by Matthew McConaughey did overshadow Anne Hathaway. With an epic storyline and Nolan's direction Space, Galaxy and the Universe did reach a whole new level.I would love to rate this movie 10 stars without a second thought because it reached the depth of my heart and left me speechless. This movie is not a movie which is meant to be wasted by watching it at your laptop or TV. It's buck worthy and a must watch for all the people who wait for some new serious, touching, heartwarming, adventurous, Science Fiction and Oscar deserving movies of all time. Hat's off to both the Nolans!"
29," Many plot-holes but a solid work of sci-fi overall, with some worthy moments
","First, the good stuff. Black hole and other imagery is top notch accurate, as confirmed last year by real life observations. This is by no means 2001: A Space Odyssey just as Nolan is no Kubrick, but the movie is ambitious and does have strong points. There are a lot of things that make no sense however, first, the nature of the Apocalypse on Earth is completely nonsensical, but on the other side, the oft criticized ending by the scientifically illi terate, makes much more sense than a lot of otherwise blindly accepted parts, especially if you take into account that once you go speculative, you cannot be that wrong. There is some sound strong sci-fi along the way, but a lot of nonsense points have to be given too, though many are saved by the (almost) brilliantly consistent ending, and a lot of sci-fi themes are nicely incorporated and shown, to stimulate imagination in some capable kids.There is also a strong extra point given for respect of the father, as single fatherhood is vastly underappreciated in the wok esick culture of nowaday. The daughter ""scientist"" is celebrated despite of the fact that she entirely plagiarizes work of future generations transmitted by her daddy, which is taken as her modest denial in a culture desperate but unable to obtain wok ef reindly heroines of disciplines for which for many centuries including decades of ins ane positive dis krimination they are proven to be a bit too soft in the head for, a touche, if subtle punch that irritated the ""critics"". Extra point for Matt Damon playing a nas ty man he always seemed to me to be.Overall, a flawed but inspiring piece that can stimulate imagination and scientific curiosity in those who have it, and some emotional roller coaster for the dimw it majority."
30," Great
",One of the best movies i have ever seen in my life!
31," A Brilliantly Emotional Journey
","I just returned after seeing ""Interstellar"" again (2nd time) and I can say that my second experience was even more powerful than the first. I'm trying to find the right words to express the thrilling journey that is this film. First I'd like to advice you to try and pay attention to every single line - nothing is said without purpose and everything is somehow connected. It slowly builds up with the beginning to this phenomenal emotional ride and it will not let go until the very end. It will keep you on the edge of your sit - literally -, it will make you cry, it will make you jump, it will completely absorb you. Throughout the course of it I forgot I was in a cinema. I was living every single moment with the characters, feeling what they're feeling. At times, I found myself staring blankly trying to comprehend its complexity - How can this be? Is this really happening? Can it be so epic? The second time I saw it I understood the importance of every single scene and line, I saw more connection, more intricacy and (even) more genius in it. The first time it was grand and overwhelming, it just hit me hard and I couldn't really pay attention to details. The emotional journey part was very important to me; but of course, there are the stunning visuals which contribute immensely and transcend you there, into the action. They were fantastic, superb, simply put, film-making at its finest.This is all, of course, from my point of view - a super sci-fi, fantasy, adventure and all associated genres enthusiast. Although I cannot imagine how one, regardless of their movie preferences, can dislike ""Interstellar"" - it's that good.What I'm obviously saying is GO SEE THIS MOVIE. Expect epicness. It will not disappoint."
32," a rare 10 out of 10 for me
","What an incredible film, a mesmerizing ride from minute 1 to minute 169. I couldn't believe when it ended that it was already finished; time appeared to go away quickly when watching this in the theater and remember when it ended, I wished there was more of this epic movie.Great directing, great performances, the effects/sets could have been better (I like my detail which unfortunately some scenes/effects lacked) and you got to take a big leap of faith to ignore the obvious paradox. If you do the latter, you will enjoy a Nolan's masterpiece.One of my top ten movies of all time and most likely the best sci-fi I have ever watched."
33," Emotional Puzzle
","the sixth sense meets inception. makes you cry, sweat, and question your own actions in the face of these scenarios, if you approach the film wholeheartedly and ready for the ride then it will take you on quite a journey, and you'll only want to see it again and again. the music really does the job of keeping you suspended, Anne Hathaway and Jessica chastain do fine work, as does Matthew McConaughey, and the little girl playing a younger Jessica Chastain pulls at your heartstrings. i was really really pleased with this and wish it was getting as much attention and praise as it deserves, i think the writing was genius and it really had my brain working hard. you walk out of the theater and everyone around you is talking about it from the sidewalk to the subway ride home, everyone, it was really funny to see."
34," Interstellar: How Film Can Make you Feel Adventure Again
","Every generation of movie goers sees one film, maybe two, that changes the game for them. It becomes a signature moment that they remember years to come. They remember where they saw it, who they saw it with, even where they were sitting. Christopher Nolan has proved to be a film maker who works best with a big canvas, and he has never been given a canvas bigger than the one he used for his latest film, ""Interstellar"". I feel I can't even call going to see a Nolan piece a movie but more like an ""event"". For the average movie goer, they most likely aren't familiar with the directors of the films they're seeing but most know Nolan. Most know of Nolan because he has made some of the biggest, thrilling, and thought provoking films of the past decade from the Dark Knight trilogy to Inception.It's almost not worth trying to do a plot synopsis of ""Interstellar"" because it is difficult to try to condense the happenings in a film this huge because I know that I will leave out something big. Anyway, the film takes place in a potentially not-too-distant future where the earth has become unable to produce all but a few crops and it will get to a point where none will be able to grow and man will die out. In comes an engineer/pilot/father Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) who is entrusted to be part of a space expedition to venture beyond a newly discovered wormhole to try and find a new planet capable of inhabiting the human race. Astronauts from previous missions have supposedly landed and have been sending signals for them to come.McConaughey has always had that ""movie star"" potential and I think this is the film that puts him in that title. This was a truly star making role due to the size of the film and I honestly believe he is the only man who could have done it. ""Interstellar"" was originally supposed to be done by Steven Spielberg before he dropped out and Nolan stepped in. Nolan, clearly influenced by past Spielberg films like ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" and ""Jaws"", puts McConaughey in a role in the same vein as Richard Dreyfuss in ""Close Encounters"" or Roy Schneider in ""Jaws"". They needed an actor who could be looked at as an everyday guy who is experiencing incredible circumstances and McConaughey is able to display the emotion required for a man who has to drop everything, including his family whom he knows he may not see again, and try to save the human race. You can see it in his eyes and hear it in his voice and your heart breaks and lifts with his simultaneously. This isn't necessarily a role that wins Oscars but it should be.The effects are obviously amazing. This, much like ""Gravity"" last year, is a film that needs to be seen on the big screen, especially in IMAX. This, along with the haunting score of frequent Nolan collaborator Hans Zimmer, almost transports you to that necessary place that makes the events happening on screen seem possible. Kind of piggy backing off of that point, there will be those who will trash the film for ""the science isn't accurate"". Those comments are nonsense because no matter what ""science"" tells us, there is just no way for us to actually comprehend what is beyond a wormhole or what would happen if we attempted to go through one. Could we really transcend time and space? Would we discover new worlds and new civilizations? Impossible for us to say at this point, but what makes this film so great is that we are able to see the ideas of ""what can be"". It's the mystery of the unknown that both frightens and enthralls man and few films have been able to capture those feelings like ""Interstellar"" In a time where there are no more explorers, we're fortunate to be put in a position where we can feel what is like to discover and explore new worlds.People will remember ""Interstellar"" for either being a truly great film experience or ""not as good as 2001: A Space Odyssey"". This is one of most popular slights against the film so far as it is the closest thing to ""2001"" and defenders of the Kubrick classic will argue to the death that it doesn't live up to it. This is an argument that no one will win because it is a generational issue. People see these landmark films during their youth and they leave such an impression on them, that it almost becomes blasphemy to hear of another film made years later, rivaling the one they saw. People want to believe that the film from their time was the best and that no film will be able to capture those emotions they first felt and the memories that it created for them. I respect and detest this because I will most likely feel the same way when future space adventures in the same vein as ""Interstellar"" come out and I fear it is something that is out of my control. Much of the film circles around the idea that love is the one true thing that travels purely through time and space because it is that connection we feel with one another that makes us human and that can be applied with our love for certain films. The connection we feel with our favorite films is almost unshakable and those who think they can make us waver from those feelings are exercising in futility.In the end, ""Interstellar"" is one of those landmark films. It's a chance for us to escape reality and feel sense of adventure, hope, and amazement that rarely comes around. Don't miss it."
35," A good - not great - movie that falls apart the more you think about it.
","Not many directors have the clout of Christopher Nolan. Most of them receive notes from their fretting studios: suggestions (or demands) to change plot points or highlight certain characters/actors, which must be adhered to for contractual or financial reasons. With huge, intelligent blockbuster successes like the Dark Knight franchise and Inception, Nolan has deservedly won carte blanche from Warner Bros. for Interstellar - he gets garguantan sums of money and complete autonomy to realise his artistic vision. In effect, he's making an indie movie on a blockbuster scale. Ironically, this lack of oversight might be just what keeps Interstellar - a very good, occasionally brilliant foray into the furthest reaches of our galaxy and beyond - from greatness.Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), a former pilot and engineer, is now reluctantly scraping together a living as a farmer on a starving Earth. With sandstorms swirling and food supplies dwindling by the day, it doesn't seem likely that Cooper's children, stoic Tom and inquisitive Murphy, will have much of a world left to inherit when they grow up. While investigating a ""ghost"" in Murphy's bedroom, Cooper deciphers a message that brings him to a top-secret NASA base. Once there, Cooper learns from his former mentor, Dr Brand (Michael Caine), that NASA is looking for solutions to Earth's crisis in other galaxies. A recently-opened wormhole has given NASA and its scientists access to a whole new galaxy of planets. Brand appeals to Cooper to pilot the final and most important mission: to determine whether any of three identified planets can truly host human life. But it's a journey from which Cooper might never return - one that will take him away from his kids and everything he has ever known and loved.That's not even the half of it – Nolan's narrative is a sprawling, ambitious one that asks heavy metaphysical questions about the position and role of humanity in the universe, filtered through the prism of a father and daughter whose bond transcends time and space. It's shot through with complex scientific theories about wormholes and time travel courtesy of theoretical physicist Kip Thorne (who served as a consultant on the film). Indeed, much of Interstellar plays with such philosophical gravity that one can't help wondering if it's simply too deep a subject to be effectively communicated in a movie that must also create emotional stakes and real characters.Clocking in at almost three hours, Interstellar pulses with intelligence and occasional bursts of brilliance. The science and emotion of its story works best on each planet they manage to visit, with Nolan crafting some chillingly smart sci-fi moments amidst the human drama experienced by Cooper's crew. As badly as Cooper wants to save enough fuel to make the return trip home, Amelia Brand (Anne Hathaway) has both professional and personal stakes in visiting the planet that's furthest away from the wormhole. They trade hope for time, the minutes they use to hunt for salvation translating into the loss of decades with their loved ones. The film is at its best when the members of the Endurance - including David Gyasi's Romilly and Wes Bentley's Doyle - confront one another, and establish contact (or fail to do so) with the scouting teams that preceded them through the wormhole.But Interstellar also suffers from a bloated and faintly silly final act. The science of it may be well-founded (who knows, after all, what miraculous answers really do lie within a black hole?) and the concept very cool, but it doesn't quite translate as such. Instead, the film hyper-blasts itself into a oddly cheerful (and confusing) ending that feels purely fictional and not at all scientific. There's no denying, either, that Nolan could have carved half an hour or more out of Interstellar without losing any of its narrative or emotional density. Instead, many scenes unfold in an almost obstinately languid fashion, including a moment when Cooper is left gasping for oxygen on the icy terrain of an alien planet. It's pretty evident, too, that Nolan really wanted to make sure his audiences knew how little greenscreen he used to make the film; for no other discernible reason, his camera lingers in extreme close-up - and far too often - on the exterior shells of the various spacecrafts designed for the film.Nolan can afford the best when it comes to his cast as well, and it shows. McConaughey anchors the film with a gravitas and tenderness quite unknown before his career McConnaissance, and he's ably supported by a steely Hathaway, whose character, just like the film she's in, blends cold, pragmatic science with a churning wealth of emotion. Jessica Chastain and Matt Damon, in roles perhaps best left unspecified to avoid any explicit spoilers, are excellent too - the former radiates quite enough warmth and intelligence to make us believe that she can save the world, and the latter admirably treads in morally grey areas to good effect.For months before its release, Nolan kept Interstellar firmly under wraps. Everyone speculated that it would be a game-changer - a sci- fi blockbuster as thrilling and thought-provoking as it is entertaining. In some ways, that's true of the final product: Nolan's film is brave, brainy film-making, and it looks absolutely spectacular. But, on closer examination, Interstellar loses some of its gloss and varnish - and beneath it all lies an unwieldy script that meanders a little too long and wastes a little too much of the big, breathtaking ideas that underpin its story."
36," Unmatched visuals and writing, yet sentimentalist and most definitely not Nolan's best directorial work
","I will keep this short for the sake of not spoiling anything.Right off i should say I love Nolan. I adore most of his movies, and Interstellar is no exception. It is a marvelous piece of work whose visuals will be hard to forget. His shots of space and the way he played with colors is rather masterful. Maybe i expected it to be greater than what i saw, but even though i was moved by the movie i did not quite feel like he created something great with 'Interstellar.' This could be attributed maybe to his overuse of sentimentalism in the father-daughter relationship he creates. Nolan really tries to make you cry with this one. I have never seen him use such powerful emotions in his movies; however that is not necessarily a good thing for this movie, given that he uses his time trying to develop a family relationship at the expense of flow and congruency. Again, the Visuals are completely off the charts. The visual imagery is truly beautiful and something that Nolan has always excelled at. Given that the most visually stunning movie in recent years, Gravity, recently came out, Interstellar does not lag behind and shows you a spectacle of Visual effects.He will most likely win Visual effects at the Oscars. The Hans's score is marvelous and will most likely earn an Oscar nomination. Matthew Mcconaughey's acting is good, but nothing stellar, especially coming off the best acting role of his career. He plays the character like it should be played, but Nolan's characters never being truly drawn out or rounded does not help him any.The same can be said for the rest of the cast. The little girl was marvelous though. I do not want to reveal any piece of the story whatsoever, but i have to say, it is one of the most original scripts i've ever seen. Ultimately this movie is entertaining. There is no way Nolan can miss that. Another great thing that Nolan excels at is INSPIRING. By the time the credits rolled and people walked out, I sat there still in awe at the strong sense of human will the movie conveys. Personally, I don't think this is Nolan's best. I believe Memento stands as his masterpiece. But with Nolan, everyone has their own favorite movie. Maybe for some, Interstellar will be their favorite movie, for it is really Nolan's most ambitious and visually-striking work. By the way, Anyone else who even tries to compare Interstellar to ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is out of their mind. Kubrick's mission was to create art. Nolan in ""Interstellar"" sets to awe and inspire its audiences. It is truly a great piece of work."
37," One viewing may not suffice
","I saw this opening night (Thursday). I wanted the full monty. That means IMAX (I drove across town to get it). Wow! There are only a handful of films that have visually overwhelmed me and required a second go (or more). The first was 2001 A Space Odyssey. Star Wars Empire Strikes Back and Avatar come to mind for now. This was such a spectacle with a very complex script I'll admit I left the theater with a lot of questions. I knew it was a viscerally thrilling experience, I just couldn't fully explain the ending to my inquiring mind. I write this piece having seen this amazing film again four days later (No IMAX). OMG! I loved this movie even more tonight than four days ago. For me at least, it took two viewings for the grandeur of this project to reveal its power and intellectual reach. This is a science fiction film for the ages!"
38," One of the best Sci-Fi movie at the moment
","Expect very much from the cast and director. And all expectations fulfilled. The film is almost 3 hours, but they are not feeling. Time flies by. No slack in the story-line. Everywhere where there might be desired drool, snot or lengthy disquisitions - all collected in a couple of phrases and capacious video sequences. Nor any stupid nonsense about the Bible and God. It's Sci-Fi, baby! After viewing the impression left is not even like the movie, and how soundly from the book that you read with pleasure. Lots of thoughts left to think. The film, like a good book revealed to you something new, along with the author allowed to dive into his world. World, so close to ours. Very suggest targeting the film for viewing. Even if you do not like everything in the movie, you will get acquainted with one of the best representatives of the genre on today date."
39," Theory of everything
","How hard it is, probably, not to break under the exorbitant weight of threatening ambitions, especially when it comes to ""the most anticipated film of the year"" - that's how and in no other way did they call the last work of Christopher Nolan in a cinema environment. The benefits of this hysteria are few. Do not wait for ""everything, and immediately, and more"", because the blockbuster - the last word that comes to mind when trying to somehow characterize the ""Interstellar"", because the intellect here clearly outweighs even such a smart exterior design. As it went, it did not sound, but we have a truly multifaceted and complex film that can be adequately perceived in several different planes, and the maximum effect will be achieved only if you are able to look deeper.In the not too distant future, humanity is at a stage of regression: high technologies no longer worry us as much as the primary need for food. The farmer's profession becomes one of the most respected, and the craft is not easy, because for certain reasons nature is no longer our friend - one by one the whole vegetable crops are destroyed, refusing to yield crops. Against this background, the former pilot, and now the farmer Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) is invited to join an expedition designed to test potentially life-worthy planets in another Galaxy, the passage into which, in the form of a so-called ""wormhole"", was recently discovered in our Solar System . While the expedition is busy searching, Dr. Brand (Michael Caine) here on Earth will have to complete his research and development, as a result of which he plans to find an effective way to transport the world's population to a new home. But if suddenly he does not find it - on board the interstellar ship there is a sufficient stock of the terrestrial gene pool to start the population ""from scratch"" - this is not an iridescent version of the development of events called ""plan B"". As a form in his latest work, Nolan uses a so-so, relatively speaking, ""fantastic"" plot, in which, however, modern scientific research is much more than some fantasies of the creators. Without the second, however, it was not done either - but more on that later. At the same stage, it should be said that the script is really very tightly based on modern physics and currently existing theories, and uses a lot of scientific terms - so if you do not know, for example, what the ""event horizon"" is, and why the measure approaching the black hole, time slows down - it makes sense to prepare yourself a little before watching the movie, so you can understand what the heroes are talking about.For all this physics and mathematics, of course, there are real human fates, feelings and experiences. The film is still at the beginning, before the departure of Cooper devotes a long time demonstrating family interactions - but there, in the ""ordinary"" terrestrial environment, this looks quite ordinary. However, as the story develops, the emotions and factors that generate them gradually take on a completely different form - here Nolan already tangles this tangle consisting of imperfection of our psyche, instincts and feelings towards others much more densely. In the emotional aspect, the film turns out to be very strong - without any conventionality or falseness. It is here that one of the most memorable scenes that produces such an effect is due to the breadth of the talent of the magnificent McConaughey. After it there is no doubt that the viewer will stay with the hero until the end, at whatever cost. Nolan allegedly opposes the cold soulless cosmos to the warmth of real human feelings, emphasizing their significance. In this regard, I would like to note that the culmination and its justification will probably not be understood by all, since here the plot departs from the science trail, it goes, in the literal sense, to the unknown - without spoilers it is difficult to say more, therefore, I just recommend not to take this allusion literally, and focus on what it means. It is also important to read between the lines and see things in perspective - and then you can see where as more logic than it might seem at first glance. But there will also be an ambiguous finale, leaving behind mixed feelings, and infusing a new subtext to where it would seem that everything has already been laid out on the shelves.
""Interstellar"" amazes with its multitasking and coverage of the topics being raised. To some extent, this is also a minus, because the ideas embedded in the script, would be more than enough for three or four films. From this, it is not always perceived exactly, and at some moments even requires some effort and concentration when viewing. But in a decent way to accumulate so much food for thought in one movie, even three hours, by force of units. Not to mention how effective the picture works on the upper outer level, combining visual and sound images. Visually, the film is completely different from modern digital blockbusters: shot on a film and with real scenery, it generates an absolutely unique atmosphere. The same goes for the sound series - Zimmer clearly caught the mood: the sound is old-fashioned, unorganized and bright. This surprisingly deep, beautiful author's cinema is the long-awaited odyssey of Nolan, which remains in memory for a very, very long time."
40," WOW
","I was speechless when I finished this film, the story, acting and visuals just seem to good to be true.
For a film with such a big scale, it does a great job establishing the world and characters, it can be a lot to take in bit there is just so much emotional payoff that it makes it worth sitting through 3 Hours of film.
I won't spoil anything, but the ending is just perfect. It makes you want more from the film but in a way that doesn't make it unsatisfying.I really have no complaints, it does everything it sets out to do, it is a real shame this didn't win any Oscars."
41," Speechless masterpiece!
","I have never in my life experienced such an emotional brake as I did today watching Interstellar! I left theatre shaking violently, crying and having I think 150 BPM. Every single piece of the movie from the story itself, visuals, music and acting is a perfect combination and perfection. I even can't find right word to give you proper review (partly because English is not my native)and summarization won't give the movie justice. The only thing I regret that I watched it dubbed (though in my country dubbing is really good) I advice t go see the movie alone on yourself as I did and it will pull you in from the first frame to this epic journey!P.S. Oscars to Nolan and the movie right away!"
42," It is not Memento, it is not The Dark Knight, it is not Inception. It is Interstellar.
","A Quantum Leap in Film making.The greatest story ever told. A movie that encompasses all that is and can be Human. Interstellar bravely Transcends into the unknown throughout time and space, leaving no one behind. My persistent craving for unwavering diligence in directing and acting has been satisfied with ample sufficiency. Very few take true pride in what they do, and most never try. But to never give up hope and to reach for the stars is how real greatness is achieved.Thank you Mr. Nolan(s), thank you 'Cooper', for creating a piece that holds such faith in mankind's will to survive, and most of all, Love.5D 10/10"
43," Grand ideas don't make great movies
","It is beyond me how people can claim the movie to be 'brainy', 
 'intelligent', 'well written'... With all the things I read about the 
 movie prior to seeing it makes it the biggest disappointment I've 
 experienced from cinema in years. I give 1 star to bring balance to the 
 current rating, in reality this movie is of course not that bad.
 
 The whole idea behind the plot is that McConaughey ended up in this 
 blackhole where 5 dimensions were compressed into 3 dimensions and 
 stuff, and where he was able to manipulate gravity by sending his 
 daughter the message which was imperative for saving humanity. So what 
 in fact happened is through this ridiculously improbable chain of 
 events McConaughey ended up inside this blackhole. All this was 
 apparently the result of a bigger plan all along. Was there really no 
 easier way for (future humans/aliens) to transmit this data, and if 
 they built this time-space warping machine inside the blackhole - means 
 they had access to the data all along? And also means they chose 
 McConaughey daughter on purpose? So I don't understand, what was this 
 purpose? Could they not have connected their portal to professor's 
 office a long time ago, or go for one of the ten billion more rational 
 alternatives?
 
 On a side note: is it not funny how McConaughey ignored the message NOT 
 TO GO from the same 'ghost' yet followed the rest of the directions? 
 While in the end of the movie he idiotically repeats his feeble 
 attempt. Had he added 'it's you dad' or any other sensible hint he 
 would have saved his daughter years of suffering (and maybe a lifetime 
 for himself when he realises this). And I don't even want to get into 
 how ridiculous it is that he transmitted data by moving the hands on 
 the watch, which was unaffected after being picked up, meaning it was 
 hardly gravitational manipulation was it? What was the point of trying 
 to be scientific and trying to explain it in this way then. If he could 
 do that, he ought to have found a better solution that did not require 
 his daughter 25 years to figure out.
 
 And anyway, they saved humanity by building this massive station named 
 after his daughter (by that time they knew what he went through and 
 they still named it after her?). Why couldn't they have done the same 
 thing on Earth? Just build the same goddamn station on Earth without 
 needing to harvest their gravitational energy bullsh*t, bam, humanity 
 saved in the same way.
 
 Grand ideas don't make great movies if you can't deliver them 
 properly... It is atrocity to compare this to Kubrick's masterpiece..."
44," Nolan's Sci-fi magic strikes again on the big screen
","""Do not go gentle into that good night; Old age should burn and rave at close of day."" that was one hell of a dialog from the movie #INTERSTELLAR even though it was inspired from a poem. Chris Nolan made a film which make's even science freaks also don't know some of 'em which he implied in the film. It is evidently clear that he doesn't like this 3-D world which instead he created 5-D world and made 'Time' as a physical quantity in his world. Literally there is no words to explain the ingenuity of Chris. The way he crafted the characters and effectively using technical expertise and screen writing definitely make us to taste 'Transcendence'. once again he proved that he is not a contemporary director but a director who evolved from unrealistic future.Matt did a splendid job by portraying 'cooper' and express his emotions as a destitute and grief-stricken father was incomparable. Hans zimmer, he is at his best. Anne and Jess made justice to their roles. Matt Damon and Michael Caine played a pivotal role as well. Chris also made 'India' as part of his film because of 'M.O.M' i think, even though it is little about India i think. overall film is astoundingly superb with intense screenplay unless you detest physics or you lack keenness but its better to study a Lil'bit before 'bon appetite'. Remember ""do not go gentle into that good movie"".#INTERSTELLAR and #INCEPTION are the best sci-fi masterpieces i've ever seen in this decade. Take a bow Chris Nolan and ""orgoglioso DI es sere UN fan DI Christopher Nolan''"
45," Seriously people??
","I do not know what kind of PR team the production team has hired to promote this film, but obviously they are doing great job as it has already higher score than Inception... Seriously guys??? This film has 5/10 stars at best, and even that for just potential. Rest of it is lost because the film has absolutely no logic to it.Stupid, illogical and at times really boring and long. Even though I am no scientist, it was so stupid on so many levels with even the most basic of facts that I have no comments to this....Set your expectations low- no way in hell does this film deserve any of that praise posted here...."
46," Makes three hours feel like a lifetime - awful
","OK, I'll keep this brief, but I'll also nail my credentials to the mast first. I know science, cosmology, sci-fi and film-making pretty well. I have, in the past taught film studies at degree level, and worked on the production of more than one major Hollywood sci-fi film. I read Stephen Baxter and I like space stuff a lot. More than a lot. And why am I telling you this? Because I should have loved ""Interstellar"", but I didn't for one simple reason: It is a truly dreadful piece of film-making.I won't even bother with dissecting the ""science"" in the film, because that isn't really the issue (it is wrong on pretty much every level). I'm not even going to bother complaining about the absurd audio balance in the sound mix. And I'll ignore the sub-standard special effects - because FX don't a great movie make.The issues I have with Interstellar are essentially these: The film is an arse-numbing three hours long, and feels far longer. The pace is stunningly poorly judged - the first hour in particular could have been cut to ten minutes and far more would have been gained than lost.The characters are paper-thin, and I didn't care about any of them. The plot is entirely derivative (mostly of the vastly superior ""Contact""). The special effects aren't special at all and the editing (or lack of) is so self-indulgent it is a text book example of a director so enamoured with his project that he loses objectivity. The result is a plodding, flabby, and desperately dull movie devoid of any real excitement or emotional impact.I won't go on, but special mention must be made of the planets - Paddling World and Coldworld. You see virtually nothing of either, and so utterly uninteresting are they that what should have been a moment of genuine cinematic wonderment was squandered with a bit of poor CGI painfully inferior to ""A Perfect Storm"" and a location less dramatic than your own back garden.I've probably not been a brief as I intended, but as I write this I feel the disappointment and actual anger I felt on leaving the cinema bubbling to the surface again. It was a total let-down and a waste of more than three hours of my life. The gushing reviews on here are ridiculous and absurd, and I am forced to conclude that reviewers either watched a different film to me, or saw something so brilliant it completely passed me by. I am fairly confident I didn't doze off, although I desperately wanted to.So in conclusion, ""Contact"" did all of this far, far better, fifteen years ago. In Contact the characters are human, believable, beautifully realised and you care what happens to them. The relationship between Father and Daughter is deeply moving and inspiring. But then the plot is far more sophisticated anyway, dealing with the social tensions and impact of the discovery of extra-terrestrial life, the science is accurate and entirely plausible (it was written by Carl Sagan after all), the movie is genuinely thrilling and full of spectacle, and it has something very profound to say.Contact is everything Interstellar is not, and it has a considerably shorter running time. Contact brought tears to my eyes, Interstellar bored me to tears."

48," Oh, no!
","It is incomprehensible to me that I watched the same movie that the majority of reviewers of this movie on IMDb seemed to. Perhaps I was unknowingly sucked into a blackhole, wormhole, or plot hole that most of the other reviewers of this movie managed to avoid. All I know is that my hard-earned money was sucked into this monstrosity along with me and for that I am truly regretful. Like a few other commenters, I had absolutely no feelings or connection with any of the characters, even hoping at times that they would all fail in their meaningless endeavors. A ridiculous premise with outlandish and unscientific bases, very little of this movie makes any sense at all. It amazes me that Nolan was able to draw the acting talent to this waste of time, as their considerable skills are completely wasted on this drivel.I should note that on several occasions, I actually couldn't help but laugh out loud at the absurdity, and that fact was truly telling for me.Mr. Nolan, et al - you owe me two hours and forty-nine minutes of my life back!"
49," Sci-Fi with a Big Heart
","The Earth in the near future is a shell of what it used to be. The plant life is dying. The very soil that used to sustain it is destroying it. There are some underground efforts headed by Prof. Brand (Michael Caine) called Lazarus to find an alternative world to settle in somewhere out there in the vast reaches of space. Three such potential worlds have been found beyond a black hole near Saturn.Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) is a retired NASA engineer who had been chosen to pilot this effort to seek out and investigate these alternative planets. Despite the stiff objections of his 10-year old daughter Murphy (Mackenzie Foy), he accepts the mission and lifted off together with his crew of three scientists, Amelia (Anne Hathaway), Doyle (Wes Bentley) and Romilly (David Gyasi). From there, we are brought on an unparalleled adventure of space, time and humanity by a master who is probably the most mentally-challenging writer and director in the film industry today, Christopher Nolan. Front and center in this spectacular sci-fi film is the timeless bond between a father and his daughter. The poetic story he has written is multi- layered and emotional, despite its scientific jargon and bleak settings.As with his other projects, Nolan works with some of the best technical talents, many of whom are award-winners in their fields. Everyone on this team are guaranteed at least Oscar nominations for their work in this film, and they may in fact all actually win.Film editor Lee Smith, sound engineers Gregg Landaker and Gary Rizzo and musical scorer Hans Zimmer together effectively create excitement and drama. The cinematography of Hoyte van Hoytema is breathtaking especially in those wide landscape shots, both on earth and on those other planets. The visual effects are innovative as ever, particularly in the third act where a whole new dimension was created. Production designer Nathan Crowley had some nifty ideas for his futuristic props. The circular design of the mother ship Endurance was beautiful in its symmetry. The designs of the robotic sidekicks TARS and CASE are in no way similar those in Star Wars. Matthew McConaughey continues his streak of acting excellence which was just capped by an Oscar earlier this year. Michael Caine was as good as he could be expected to be. However, I found his final speech too garbled to be understood well, and it contained an important plot point. Anne Hathaway's role is a bit of a puzzle for me. While she was actually managed to be credible as a scientist, she had a rather cheesy monologue that seemed out of place when it was delivered.Three talented actresses portray the character of Murphy Cooper at different ages: Mackenzie Foy, Jessica Chastain and Ellen Burstyn. Foy goes way beyond what she was required to do in her two previous hit films the ""Breaking Dawn"" films and ""The Conjuring"". Chastain is such a riveting presence as ever, and it was good to see her again after her long break after ""Zero Dark Thirty"" and ""Mama."". Oscar winner Burstyn's singular big scene made me tear up.In the second hour, I was surprised to see a special, heretofore uncredited, big name guest star portray one of the pioneer Lazarus astronauts, Dr. Mann. This was more than a mere cameo appearance, as his character had a critical role to play in one of the many twisting episodes of this story.From ""Memento"", then ""The Prestige"" to ""Inception"", Nolan had gone for the extremes in terms of plot development. His work is not always easily comprehended on first watch. They are thought-provoking and demanding in terms of a viewer's patience and concentration. ""Interstellar"" joins this stellar list, and we are brought to yet another dimension of time and space. 10/10."
50," Hands down, mind-blowing
","This film is just legendary, I do not see why people are hating this film, its unpredictable and well just plain brilliant. A lot of the science in this movie is true (for a science fiction film). I believe this is Nolan's best yet and I believe that its probably the greatest film ever made. Matthew deserves an Oscar for his role (no joke) and Hans Zimmer's soundtrack is a masterpiece in it's own right (completely new and different from his previous work, check the dark knight trilogy and inception). The FX are brilliant and their are no complaints from me. The acting is just great and it really asks questions on who we are and our purpose. So overall to conclude this film is just MINDBLOWING!"
51," beautiful journey
","One of the best sci-fi movies.First of all, it is incredibly beautiful to watch. Honestly, it was so beautiful that I felt like I was sucked into the movie. We can feel the talent of Christopher Nolan, just by looking at the way it is filmed. The techniques he used contribute to create that visual environment in a believable way.These two important parts (image and sound) create a stunning atmosphere. You will forget you are in a movie theater, and you will be lost in space, sucked into the adventures of this new Space Odyssey, begging for more. It is a truly unique experience. I can say that I have never felt something like that in a movie theater. Then, of course, the cast. First of all, Matthew McConaughey. I discovered this actor in Tropic Thunder, but he didn't really convince me, though he was quite funny. Then I saw Dallas Buyers Club. Since that movie, I love him. In this movie... Well, he is the movie. I exaggerate a bit, since there are other great actors (some even unexpected with a special guest) who play extremely well. But he is just what was needed to feel the human part of the story (which is very important in Interstellar). He is capable of making us feel so many different emotions all along the story, as a father, as a human. Anne Hathaway was very convincing, all together the actors managed to create some harmony, which makes the human interactions credible. Caine, Chastaing and Affleck are a perfect choice. And then there is... The special guest, I will call him ""X"". His role, which could be seen as a minor role, is actually much more important than that. He proves, once again, that he is a great actor. Watch and see. And finally, the scenario/story. I won't spoil anything here; I'll just try to convince you how great it is. Nolan is known to revolutionize everything when he tries a new genre in cinema. Well, once again he did it. With The Dark Knight he revolutionized the superhero genre. With Interstellar he's revolutionizing the sci-fi genre in cinema. From what I heard, he worked with a physicist (in gravitational physics and astrophysics) to help him with that movie. And we can feel and see it. During the fifties, Asimov laid the foundations of modern science fiction. Lucas and Kubrick did the same in cinema. Today, Nolan is laying the new foundations of the genre in cinema, proving that cinema is still at the beginning of what can be done (brace yourselves my friends, we have not seen anything yet). My rating for this movie can only be a 10, because in itself, it is a beginning for a new kind of cinema. It IS a classic. Those who say ""we can't compare this movie to 2001 Space Odyssey, nor can we compare Nolan to Kubrick"" are wrong. We can, and we should. Talented people don't live only in the past, some genius live today, among us. And Nolan is one of them. Many say that he is overrated. I truly don't think so. Only time will answer that.This is the sci-fi movie of the decade. Just go for it, without a second thought."
52," Matthew McConaughey explains the origin of his daughter's name. To his daughter's face.
","Science fiction fans don't need everything spelling out for them. That's why the narration was removed from Blade Runner. That's why 2001: A Space Odyssey has no dialogue in its opening and closing twenty minutes. That's why R2D2 doesn't speak English.There's a scene in Interstellar in which Matthew McConaughey explains the origin of his daughter's name. To his daughter's face. This blunt method of explaining Murphy's Law to the audience is just one example of the unnecessary exposition which Interstellar's running time is so bloated by. It is also the first of many inferior echoes of Contact. In Contact, James Woods explains Occam's Razor in a similar fashion, however it is justified by the court of law context in which the scene takes place.More significantly however is the lifting of a major theme from Contact in which Jodie Foster never fully moves on from the loss of her father. Jessica Chastain's character here does likewise, only without the emotional resonance because she is so bitter that it's hard to sympathise with her. The other female character in 'Interstellar' (yeah there's only two) also spends all her screen time pining after a man. Feminists - stay away!Another silly moment is the shot for shot homage to Event Horizon. This is when one scientist explains to another scientist what a wormhole is. Which is like a driving instructor explaining to another driving instructor what biting point is. It wouldn't happen, like, ever. At least when Sam Neil gave the low down on wormholes in Event Horizon he was addressing blue collar workers so it was, once again, justified by context.Perhaps the goofiest thing in the whole film is TARS, a computer with delusions of being the next HAL 9000, which is actually nothing more than metallic origami. Have I mentioned it knows a joke? Yeah it has been programmed with one joke and it uses this joke many times. The joke is that humour is quantifiable by percentage.Why watch this when you can watch Contact, 2001: A Space Odyssey or Silent Running? Why go for Christopher Nolan's take on Dust Bowl migration when you can read John Steinbeck's instead?On a positive note there are some cool graphics to look at. You know, like the cool graphics in The Hobbit or Transformers."
53," That's not shinola you see thru that black hole, Grasshopper.
","A good friend of mine, the writer Mark Shulman, once pointed out that our standards are being gradually eroded, so that sadly, we are left with less and less in lieu of a threshold of acceptability, finding ourselves not unlike frogs in a pan being brought to a slow, imperceptible boil.Christopher Nolan and some of his cast are telling the press that Interstellar is a love story. I will take them at their word and assume that whatever else I picked up on was left there unwittingly, for the rest of us to parse through. Considering how much pain is involved in traveling to and from a crowded movie theater on a Saturday night, I feel like it's my prerogative, when I have paid good money, to take a film apart if I am still hungry for substance at the end of it; and I WILL get my nourishment from something or other, if not from the movie's plot itself.The first thing that strikes me, when I think back to the experience of Interstellar, is that it leaves me with nothing, emotionally - no takeaway. I did not care about any of its characters, or believe they were real, and I did not really worry about the fate of humanity (any more than the film itself actually does, beyond paying it casual lip-service). I wasn't awed like I may have been by other wondrous space movies that Interstellar measures itself against (or steals from), and I am not compelled to go back and see any part of it ever again. (I suspect most viewers won't either, once the collective neophile contact high has passed.)For starters, I do not like the moral core of the story: Interstellar is a film about ""saving humanity"" but it is unclear who will pay for humanity's failures. The film offers a great debate over where to repopulate, but none about what we have learned from having to leave our home in the first place. There is no therapy, no penance, no sacrifice. In a way, this represents a subconscious confession about our culture's moral failures: when we run out of spaces to consume, and out of fertile ground to slash an burn, we will have to look for new worlds to expand out into, since we cannot show self control and learn to care for what we have...But enough psychobabble. A dysfunctional moral compass is not the worst thing about Interstellar.The worst thing about the film is that, to quote my girlfriend, ""It's OK to for characters to talk in pseudo-scientific gobbledygook when the show is Star Trek, because in Star Trek, they all have pointy ears.""Interstellar may be worth a glance, certainly for the photography and exciting visuals, but it is a buffet of messy ideas that fire in all directions. Clearly the script is not written by career screenwriters, but by a director who has freed himself from gravity and has achieved his own artificial self-sufficiency amid the vast nothingness. The result is an often far-fetched and unintelligible, outlandish tale which takes an awfully long time to suspend the viewer's disbelief (and cringing), to finally arrive at a tepid plot after about an hour or so.In hindsight, it makes perfect sense that Nolan's 'tightest' film is Memento, a dis-cognitive story told from the point of view of a man who is unable to string two events together, or to remember where he started.Interstellar is not an intelligent picture, but a pseudo-intelligent one. It seems designed to appeal to the sort of audience who loves to be flattered with cheap shots - a sort of space odyssey version of ""who wants to be a millionaire?"" Its success resting entirely on the fact that every member of the audience gets to feel superior. To whom? No one knows. This technique seems to be trending within the Nolan's filmography.For the rest, the picture is a narrative mess that trivializes space travel on a galactic scale, (black hole, wormhole, same difference,) and is often plagued by ridiculous star-studded cameos that shatter the viewer's concentration by landing in the middle of tense emotional scenes like a cockroach in your soup. The film is oddly timed with elliptical cuts that compress the action into some often confusing edits, and only leave in lieu of dialog some awful scenes of trite, contrived exposition, filled with emetic pseudo physics, sure to give an immature modern audience raised on Batman a sense that they are building their cultural ego by agreeing with this farce. Worst of all, it feels long and never ending.Sadly, good science fiction is hard to come by, harder than a good ordinary film even, and although this picture is somewhat entertaining, it fades away from the heart and mind, like the flickering green of the traffic light we just passed, as we head home from the cinema, once more."

55," A totally engaging SF tale told with heart.
","I found Intestellar a beautiful movie to watch and be enthralled by. After countless low grade science fiction movies parading across the screen over the decades, this one will stay with me. The viewer should watch it for story and not for the science - the cinematography is beautiful without being flashy; the acting is brilliant and musical score works perfectly with the story.I was engrossed by the movie from start to finish, held there by the humanity and feeling portrayed by the director and the actors.Why people feel the need to compare Intestellar to Kubrick's 2001 is puzzling - this is a completely different movie and one that, when I think back to watching 2001, is infinitely more watchable.Why people feel the need to pile in rate the movie '1' is beyond me and, at the time of this writing 570,000 people had averaged the rating out to 8.7 - so, don't listen to the hate, just watch it and enjoy."
56," Got tricked by paid reviews
","I watched this movie yesterday. I was very excited after reading so many perfect 10 star reviews for this movie so I was expecting a perfect movie, really!Before I continue, I must say I really love sci-fi movies, and I am deeply interested in black holes, time travel, wormholes, interstellar traveling. Wow, I couldn't think twice, this could be the perfect fit for me! I had really high expectations.For the entire movie I was feeling like: ""the best part of the movie should soon"", but never came. I had hard time understanding what was really happening, and too many minutes of the movie were badly wasted in dramatic scenes of love, confusing speeches, formulas. All I wanted to see was the wormhole travel, spacetime and gravity distortion, galaxies, nebulae, etc. I mean, I wanted to see what is in the deep space, and what could be human life in a planet million light years away from us.SPOILERS AHEADMaybe the movie drove me nuts, or I lost interest, but after they crossed into the new galaxy, all I felt was confusion. I never understood what was really happening, what were they rescuing, what were those 3 planets and how they knew too much about them, why was there a black hole? Even I tried hard connecting every scene and plot in the movie, I failed. What I disliked the most was the fact that the feeling of discovering something AMAZING and new was not successfully transmitted to us. I wanted to feel that great emotion of discovering deeps space but I failed. Instead the characters talked about crazy physics and plans to save humanity. Not to mention the multi-plot scenes after the fight, totally no sense.Please don't get tricked by this website and fake reviews ad I did. This is reason I signed up at IMDb (first review), to warn others. The idea of the movie is fantastic, but poorly developed and acted, totally confusing, too much cliché. Watch it but don't have high expectations as me, you will be disappointed."
57," To the stars - away from the common sense!
","This year is not very good for the sci-fi cinematography. Besides multiple unintentional parodies of the genre (like X-Men: Days of Future Past), there was actually only one big-budget movie worth watching: On the Edge of Tomorrow. It seems like Tom Cruise is one of the few Hollywood stars able to wisely pick roles. His recent achievements leave little to desire: Valkyrie, or Knight and Day are good at worst, with the high pitch of Oblivion. Are we able to say the same about Matthew McConaughey? Unfortunately, not. Although his recent movies are above average (True Detective or Dallas Buyers Club), the latest picture he plays in, Interstellar (directed by Christopher Nolan and written by him and his brother), is a huge letdown and misunderstanding. I don't think anyone being fond of ""hard"" science-fiction stories will like it. Here is why.Firstly, the story. It is in general similar to Mission to Mars or The Red Planet, where the handful of daredevils are put in the spaceship to venture on a mission, which result will impact the whole human race. Unfortunately, which is the usual problem in this case, the whole plot is neither engaging, nor entertaining. We have a bunch of uninteresting people making uninteresting things in space. Maybe because of the long time span of the picture, the viewer quickly gets bored and does not care about the main characters. Besides, the space adventure is mixed with the very personal story of the father trying to save his children (which is also a time-consuming thread here). Anyway, the main conclusion of Interstellar is the banal statement that ""love is the most important thing in the world"". Do we really need to sit for almost three hours in the cinema to get this? By coincidence, the second problem is the length of the movie. Currently, when the the picture is recorded not on the tape, but in the digital medium, every director tries to surpass his rivals by creating as long movie as possible. Maybe it is supposed to be the emblem of his might, skills or wisdom? I have no idea, but the fact is that the contemporary blockbusters are difficult to watch especially because they last for three or more hours, having the plot for only half of this time. This is exactly the case with Interstellar. The presented story is far from complex, and could easily fit in two hours. In fact, the first forty minutes of the movie have nothing to do with the rest of the story and could be recapitulated by the narrator in two sentences...This film tries to treat the topic of interstellar travel seriously. Unfortunately, some ideas are presented according to our current knowledge of physics and astronomy, while others are just stupid. This mixture makes the suspension of disbelief, necessary to enjoy such movie, impossible to attain. On one side we have wormholes, black holes, higher dimensions of space and the silence of the void. On the other hand, there is totally unconvincing reality of the XXI century, where farmers are more valuable than engineers (guys, really?) and tomography is (mysteriously) gone. In one scene the physicist explains convincingly the work regime of the wormhole (by the way, this scene is IDENTICAL to the one from the far better Event Horizon). In another, we see the mission robot TARS, being the member of the crew. I know that humanoid machines from fifties seem ridiculous today (like the one from The Day The Earth Stood Still), but they are really the top quality idea compared to the robots depicted in Interstellar. It is difficult to believe someone created such a model and the whole crew agreed to put it the picture! It's almost like the the wooden planet from the initial script of Alien 3...The number of errors and non-logical events is just amazing. Anyone complaining about the lack of consistency in Prometheus (which was also much better than this one) will have the real hunting ground here. In fact, the more time passes after seeing the movie, the more nonsenses are detected. Don't think about this too much, anyway, its not worthy...The Nolan brothers used their imagination a little bit too much in the final part of the story, where the word ""magic"" (interchangeable with ""nonsense"") comes to mind. As the result, the viewer is left at the end indifferent to what is presented on the screen and does not care about the fate of the characters... Please recall the infamous Black Hole, and You will have the impression of what is going on here...The music is of course the extremely important part of every picture. If the composer knows his craft, the soundtrack complements the images, creating the flawless combo (as was in Terminator, Starship Troopers, Aliens, etc.). Here we have the attempt to create the epic atmosphere, but the events shown on screen are rather uninteresting, therefore the resulting impression is just the overwhelming noise, making the viewer angry instead of touching or moving him.Unfortunately, it seems like making a good movie about the interstellar travel is extremely difficult. People like to go to the movies and see a good story. There are multiple requirements for the entertaining movie: the mystery, the convincing scenery, the real characters we could care about, finally, the emotional strain, often related to the dangers our protagonists are exposed to. Interstellar does not offer anything of these. It is a long and boring sermon about the future of Mankind in the universe, pretending to be the science-fiction movie. With this picture Christopher Nolan proved his only memorable work was Prestige and the Batman trilogy was not the accident, but the clear sign that his main achievements in Hollywood will be too long, boring and utterly disappointing pictures, initially rising hopes for a good time spent in the cinema, but leaving in a complete, sad disillusion after all."
58," Human nature as sprinkling water on plastic plants
","The film outright fails for me, because it's about all the vital stuff in life, love, loss and new discovery as each one nested in the capacity of our minds for vision. But Nolan is a logician, a geometer who has to know everything in his narrative world in advance before he can construct it. So he doesn't get any of it in an intuitive way, an allusive way, a fluid way for appearances to suggest things.He cites Zerkalo as influence, next of course to 2001, a masterwork with an elusive logic, not wholly tractable, not complete, not causal, a spontaneous capacity for images and connections between them. But he does the opposite, 2001, something tractable, complete, causal, not spontaneous. Logical.(Cool tidbit. One of the great discoveries of the past century is a limit in formal logic that implies there's more that is true than provable in a given system, something that every aware creative person knows intuitively, axiomatically to be true. I like to think this is why Malick abandoned philosophy for the cinema, proof for expression. Flipped around it means that if you stick to what is strictly provable within your narrative you must miss out on some expressible truth.)This logic screams at me in one particular strand of plot, the ghostlike presence in the girl's bedroom, at first mysterious, but it's actually Nolan's way of creating the explanation of what he's going to do inside the black hole, which is his way of creating the metaphor about love as a powerful force. How? An actual force that transcends spacetime! (Btw, all that fuss about a renowned physicist assisting the production and they go ahead and film all that black hole stuff?)In other words the only way he can create metaphor is by having it be a plot device, so that the profundity of what happens to us must be accompanied by its narrative explanation; it only succeeds in reducing the intuitions we have (about love, connectedness etc). What's left is Nolan's own journey in space towards images that expand understanding. This would be his most ambitious so far. Does he do anything interesting? The Dustbowl interviews show he wanted a more grounded approach, a good idea to start among cornfields. Better action than before. But still unimaginative.A big indication for me was the scene after Coop wakes up from cryosleep and checks his messages from Earth; an entire life has gone by, and among all the possible images that Nolan could have put there to evoke that life, in a time when so much of our vision is mobile and we carry with us cameras everywhere (even more so in that near future), he gives us static monologues before a desk. The same teary tone. What a tragedy of inexpression! The mind at play here is like the spectral Coop trapped in that boxed space behind bookshelves and able to see only loops.Nolan gambled here of course, tried to elevate himself to more than contraptions; failed. It turns out he can only roar about that night which great filmmakers gently recall without explaining. Why this man is held in high esteem in a medium that should celebrate visual ability while a modern calligrapher like Shunji Iwai is an unknown says it."
59," Dumb, dumber, dumbest!
","This is without exception one of the dumbest films I have ever sat through. Or perhaps it's a masterpiece and I'm too dumb to understand it? Anyway .....Here are some of the things (the list is not exhaustive) that I could not get my head around.There is a catastrophic failure in most of the crops of the world. And the entire scientific community simply shrugs and says, 'Oh well. Dem's the breaks' and does nothing. Seriously? Apart from that one dude in the 'super secret' NASA compound? Okay then.A super intelligent, super advanced alien civilization has been watching us. They see that the planet is in peril. That more than six thousand million people will die from starvation. So they offer a solution. Not by curing the blight mind. No, that would be far too easy.They construct a wormhole (they being five dimensional creatures 'n' all) close to Saturn ('cos Kubrick had already used Jupiter in 2001). The film makes a big deal about corn being the only viable crop still resisting the blight (cornmash beer anybody) but it's only a matter of time before that too succumbs. So It's a matter of great urgency that the astro-heroes get to the ol' wormhole as quickly as possible. So the far side of the Moon would be a handy place to put it. No, no, noooo.They place the wormhole beside Saturn. So distant from Earth that it takes two years just to fly there. And all the while any poor kids unfortunate enough to be called Dusty are getting the crap beaten out of them at Pharming College. Anybody for cornflakes? Now NASA have already explored the wormhole. They know that it opens into another galaxy, beside a black hole and an assortment of potential new worlds. Because of the proximity of the planets to the black hole, time will be distorted and a couple of hours exploring these new worlds will translate to decades back on Earth. While back on ol' Planet earth the corn crops fail and the dust storms gather pace. So this was the plan?By the super intelligent aliens? Is someone taking the p*ss? There were no planets anywhere that were ... um ... NOT right beside a black hole? Super intelligent? Doh! And so finally, after a number of silly subplots, our hero finally descends onto the event horizon of the black hole (My God! It's full of stars?). And experiences time as a physical construct. But is he shown the origin of the blight that is wiping out the planet so that he might alert the scientific community? Hell no. He is shown his daughter's bedroom on the day that he left on his 'weekend getaway.' We see him getting really upset that his daughter isn't picking up on his STAY ...... STAY! gravity assisted message, even though he should remember that she shouted STAY .... STAY! to him on that day, and he left anyway. Sheesh! And Zimmer's soundtrack? I hadn't heard about the soundtrack request came to him via email, without him ever seeing the movie. Explains a lot really. Presumably the email went something like 'If you produce anything orchestral like Kubrick, you're off the project.' So the soundtrack consisted almost entirely of ponderous bass heavy synth driven (in the cinema where I watched it) piercingly loud quasi classical discordance. Bear in mind that Kubrick chose the pieces by Strauss, etc., to assist him in editing the movie,and then realised that they actually fit perfectly, and so discarded the original soundtrack that he had commissioned.Not Nolan.NoSirreeBob! Email it in, Hans.Who listens to the music anyway? Deeply, deeply disappointing.And I loved Inception!"
60," Confused and shaky in delivering the message
","In the opening night, I walked out from the movie theater, totally disappointed to see one of my favorite directors has diminished himself to such a low lever of performance.Poorly developing plot, immature explanation of astrophysics, unbelievable and unrelated events and characters, especial effects leveled to a Disney comedy, and horrible music are only parts of my negative impression. Even Mathew McConaghey did not seem believable looking at her daughter, older than himself. Mat Damon probably did his career's worst acting. The robot was another annoying part. What did Anne Hathaway and two other guys add to the story?Using a laptop to bring down a drown and control an inter-galaxy spaceship??? Finding a livable planet after passing through the worm hole, in ""another galaxy"" seemed easier than finding an ATM machine in a US interstate highway. Why would a director hire a ""Black-Hole-World-Expert"" as an executive producer to explain a worm hole function by drawing a line on a paper and punch it with a pencil? Just reading the worm hole article in Wikipedia would give you much more sophisticated knowledge.Mr. Nolan looked completely confused in delivering a solid message: Awareness of climate changes, saving human species, teaching relativity theory to common movie goers, or the power of love. Each of them bold and superficial."
61," Solid movie
","Went to see the film Wednesday evening. Overall it was an enjoyable film from start to finish with the help of humor along the way. Excellent casting, descent visuals, and a good sound score. There were times I felt the music was overkill and would drown out certain scenes but overall well done. Story meshed real well too and threw in a few curve balls.I would have liked to see some better visuals from space. Especially when they arrived in the new solar system. Been cool to have seen unique planets of different colors orbiting each other for instance. Something unique to stamp the distance and uniqueness from our system. Trivial but it's those small things :)"
62," Extraordinary
","I watched this movie last week and honesty, after the ending credits, I couldn't talk like before. I couldn't think like I used to be. My head was exploding...It was the second time my head hurts like this (First time was Memento). You will not believe this movie's greatness and amazing work unless you know it's Christopher Nolan's masterpiece. What makes it even more amazing is all you see is really built and they're not green screen or anything. It's his specialty to make classic amazing movies. This one is the best movie of his entire works. You can feel every second... I will not say more...Just go and watch it...also don't forget to listen carefully as well. Sounds and musics are phenomenal. Go and watch it... Now..."
63," Absolutely brilliant, a masterpiece, one of the best films ever!
","I went to watch this film, not knowing much about the background of the story or what it was exactly about. It started off well, although in my opinion it did drag on for a long period of time before they actually ended up in space. This does not effect the film though or my rating one bit, as it all worked out in the end and the build up was necessary! The special effects in this film are awesome, and are used in a way which I was literally at the edge of my seat, in shear anticipation, suspense and a slight sense of nervousness. Its very tense in many parts, and it certainly keeps you thinking. I don't know how people in the right state of mind can give this film a 1 star, or say 'disappointing', 'rubbish' 'stick to batman, Nolan'! These people don't know what they are talking about and are just trying to be picky and find a way to make the film look bad! Its a brilliant film, something suitable for all the family! Definitely a film for everyone, one of the BEST MOVIES EVER!"
64," Christopher Nolan has done it again!!
","Intersellar. What Christopher Nolan has done so good with this movie was that he kept the plot simple,but we know that it's Christopher Nolan so it not going to be a simple movie. It's not. The overall plot is that the earth is dying so cooper(Matthew mcconaughey) and a team of scientists must go and find another place to live. The acting is great,what makes it so great is cooper and his daughter. Every time they were together it was WOW. The visuals were on another level. If you can,see it on the biggest screen possible. Some people may not like this movie because it talks a lot about science and many other things but you enjoy that, you will have a blast with this.Overall interstellar is a must see. I think it was Nolan's best film."
65," The most overrated movie on IMDb right now, a complete letdown
","If you saw ""sunshine"" and thought ""wow, good thing they had scientist advisers, this stuff is so plausible"", you will like ""interstellar"".If you saw ""armaggeddon"" and thought ""what an awesome movie, i just wished they would have dragged the scene where he says goodbye to his daughter out even more"", you will like ""interstellar"".If you saw ""inception"" and thought ""this movie would be so much better in SPACE!"", you will like ""interstellar"".And if you liked ""2001"" or any other intelligent/geeky sci-fi movie, you will hate ""interstellar"".Like some of Nolan's earlier works, it's long for the sake of length only. Its plot is up there with ""armaggeddon"" in pure stupidity and forced US-cowboy-patriot-macho-ism, its special effects are underwhelming, its plot twists are obvious, its setting makes no sense, its characters are flat and forgettable, and its constant citations of ""2001"" just serve to make you remember how much better Kubrick did all of this with a tiny fraction of the money almost 50 years back.Disappointing."
66," Poor in almost every possible way.
","Yesterday I watched the movie ""Interstellar"". A poorly scripted and poorly directed movie with an over-simplified pseudo-science and spoon-fed philosophical implications, basically a typically overrated Hollywood movie which takes no shame in copying from 2001: A Space Odyssey from Kubrick with none of its beauty, simplicity and none of its art. It shows that in 1968 they were able to make a masterpiece and in 2014 they can't even copy it decently. The fact that on IMDb it has an higher rating than the Kubrick masterpiece makes me lose all faith in the progress of humanity and in our current generation. I will watch 2001: A space odyssey again to forget about it and restore faith in human kind again."
67," What a massive disappointment
","Though I am not a Bat-person, and do not wish to become one, I have admired Christopher Nolan for his early films and 'Inception', though, with the exception of 'Insomnia', I always regarded them as, in the immortal words of Andrew Sarris 'less than meets the eye'. I do not like to call films pretentious, but with 'Memento' and 'Inception' the word certainly came to mind. They seemed shallow pretending to be deep.The same is, in my opinion, certainly true of 'Interstellar'. Yes, it carries you along for a ride, and yes the special effects are great, and yes, it might give us pause to think what will, in fact, be the destiny of our species. But, my dear Mr Nolan, surely you must realise that our species will not survive by planting American flags on distant planets. And, like 'Gravity' before it, the search for a happy ending has totally destroyed any shred of credibility of what might have gone before. The image of Cooper floating around Saturn without his spaceship, waiting to be picked up by a passing probe (just before his oxygen runs out, of course) is so ridiculous that if Stanley Kubrick were to be told that it is a respectful reference to the 'starchild' at the end of '2001', he'd punch you in the nose. 'Interstellar' - for all of its attempts to incorporate relativistic time dilation and very clever (I do not use that word in a derogatory sense) visual representation of multi-dimensional string theory towards the end, is void of any real cultural insight.The film simply extends 'The Wizard of Oz' into the space age and decides at the end that there is really somewhere better than home. It is TOSH! Great films tell us something memorable about the human condition, or the nature of cinema itself. This film, for all its quotes from Dylan Thomas does neither. It is for people who think that the word 'awesome' has some profound meaning and not, as is the case, an excuse for not finding a more appropriate and restrained reaction. Any suggestion that it deserves a Best Picture Oscar is a sad comment on the way that those awards have become debased in recent years."
68," Has Its' Flaws But Still Found it Pretty Awesome
","At over 2100 reviews at the time of this writing, I guess there's nothing left to be said other than my opinion.I'd probably need a PhD in Physics from MIT to understand half of the technological terms in the movie, but I still found it to be rather awesome. After reading some of the reviews here, I think a lot of people are taking this sci-fi fantasy tale way too seriously and literally.Christopher Nolan's latest, which he co-wrote as well with his brother Jonathan, at 2 hrs and 48 min in length, can be ridiculously absurd one moment then quickly turn into riveting action the next.Matthew McConaughy and Anne Hathaway lead a long list of screen notables here, too numerous to mention. I did want to mention that I thought Mackenzie Foy, as Murph, the 10-year-old daughter of McConaughy was terrific in her role.I thought the musical score here was excellent, the wit and humor of the robot TARS (Bill Irwin) was on target. the special effects could be rather hokey at times but then other times were amazing, and the movie did contain a number of twists and turns which I liked.All in all, despite its' drawbacks I found this sci-fi fantasy to be a rather awesome and epic ride."
69," Masterpiece
","If there was ever a movie that impressed me this much it would be Kubricks ""2001. Space odyssey"" and Scotts ""Blade Runner""... This one tops both...Those who respect both of above mentioned films and directors will know what I'm talking about Everything is in it's place here: the direction, the storytelling, the musical score, the acting, the seriousness and grandness of it all, even the little humor breaks are quality beyond doubt Emotive drama dialogs and sequences are so well placed and paced, not feeling pathetic but on the contrary so much thought provoking...Nolan has made his lifetime masterpiece"
70," Bloated, Self-Absorbed Nonsense
","All of the fanboys and girls must have also been in love with ""The Emperor Has No Clothes"" too. This story is thin, the characters are under developed, the emotional and logical shortcuts are ridiculous, Matt Damon is horribly cast and has become a caricature of himself, the set pieces are not inspiring, the music cues try to be bombastic enough to create emotion that simply doesn't exist and the science is a mess. When a self-important filmmaker reaches a level of success where no one will tell them ""no"" anymore, this is what comes of it. The scientific equation that sums up this film is as follows: Nolan + Interstellar = Lucas/Spielberg + Crystal Skull. A completely unremarkable and forgettable film. The Emperor truly has no clothes."
71," Combining ENTER THE VOID, THE LAST MIMSEY and .. GENESIS
","Not so much film as much as strange milestone for Hollywood.With A-List stars and a final running length of about 3 hours.This in an age where Hollywood is so desperate for profit and fast turnover that even TV shows have more commercials and less content.How is this possible? Easy answer: Nolan Brothers. Look in a mirror, say those names 7 times quickly, the Hollywood Rule Book disappears.The bizarre length effectively gives the viewer not one but three entirely separate movies joined only by the title.This reviewer in particular was gob-smacked by the first movie, effectively from the beginning until the space flight, and wanted to jump to an alternate universe where the whole movie took place in that small town, post-apocalyptic setting. With the dust. And stray drones. And the school teachers who taught that the trip to the moon was just propaganda.I cannot over-emphasize how strange this is. Even though that was not the point of the film, I suggest the production company unintentionally created (in that first hour) the best sci-fi future-world ambiance in the history of film; and, unaware of what they had accidentally done, they just moved on.BTW, a number of futurists have said that in the early part of the 21st century the odds favor at least one major volcano going ""super,"" or blowing for extended days or weeks. This will place ash/dust in the air will will cover the planet. Until this film, I never saw the image of what this might look like. Now I know. Wow.) The second film is like every Star Trek film you have ever seen, but by way of Stanley Kubrick. Not bad, but nowhere near as much fun as the first portion, Another really really cool thing is the robot that resembles one of those ladder kits you buy at Home Depot, that can form a variety of shapes. Ultra cool.Until you finally get to the third and final movie (or Act) which is meant to have profound spiritual implications but in reality only works if you have been paying careful attention for the first two and a half hours. Which is itself a strange contradiction.But the whole film is full of contradictions. There is an Epilogue too (following the unstated theme of three Acts and an Epilogue). It is fun, it is moving, it connects with the viewer, and it makes no sense at all. There are plot holes in the Epilogue that you could lose a Black Hole in. Joke intended.So, there you go, one of the oddest and most contradictory films of all time.Oh, don't even bother trying to figure out how a society that can develop AI to a degree beyond anything ever seen in film before (the Costco ladder people) still has teachers that dispute the Moon Landing and doctors who can't deal with a cough.As I keep saying, a very strange movie.But a very powerful one*** REVIEW UPDATED OCT 2016****Greetings from the year 2016. For those reading this from the far future when everyone who wishes it has instant access to the IMDb database, probably beamed right into the cortex, I am updating my review with this addenda: I confess I missed the point of the film on first viewing. After all, this is a Nolan Bros 3 hr opus which, sadly, never really achieved a proper audience and now is more or less lost to time, much like the characters in the story. On second viewing, I ""got"" that this is basically a love story set against a sci-fi backdrop. The love of a father for his daughter, the growth of Man to a new dimensional experience where love itself is quantifiable - these are amazing concepts and this is an amazing movie."
72," Filmmaker Christopher Nolan's valentine (of sorts) to 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY
","INTERSTELLAR (2014) ***1/2 Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, Michael Caine, John Lithgow, Ellen Burstyn, Mackenzie Foy, Matt Damon, Casey Affleck, Wes Bentley, David Gyasi, William Devane, Leah Cairns, Topher Grace, Timothy Chalamet, Brooke Smith (voice of Bill Irwin) Filmmaker Christopher Nolan's valentine (of sorts) to 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY (and to his daughter) continues his streak of audacious sense of space (literally) and the inner human spirit : set in the bleak future Earth is on the descent of humanity with continuous food demands and climate change with one Hail Mary of a plan by NASA - send a small crew thru a wormhole (just go with it) to see if 'they' can help us. A grand ensemble of talent assembled but it is truly a shining moment of cool-as-a-cucumber and deeply felt performance by McConaughey as the astronaut/pilot of the journey into the realms of desperation, anchoring the film with a transfixing turn (largely due to his interplay with young talented actress Foy as his daughter - later played with clear-eyed intensity by Chastain), no easy task with all the eye candy visuals that are indeed awe inspiring and a kissing cousin to GRAVITY for sheer amazement (one must see it on a big screen and IMAX would be a start as it was filmed in the medium). Hathaway has a few moments as well particularly with her brainy scientist dad Caine (a Nolan regular). The true stars are the breathtaking cinematography by Hoyte Van Hoytema, a stellar score by frequent collaborator Hans Zimmer and fantastic visual effects by literally dozens of geniuses. The only stumbling block is its slightly heavy handed message getting across but the Twilight Zone-ish final act makes up for it in spades. WOW!"
73," Boring Hollywood SOAP OPERA
","I am wondering if the people who write ""intertstellar"" 10-star reviews are actually sane, or if they base their opinion on a movie library completely deprived of everything that is sci-fi. Basically if the sic-fi component - most of which does not really happen until the end - is removed from the plot the movie by and large is a classic Hollywood soap opera. The worn-out rag of cliché family relations, all- American-dad, ""complicated"" love affair, unruly and a classic tomboy-girl, co-workers (more like co-idiots) who rebel and despite all common sense act irrationally, you know, to ""up the ante""... it really makes up 90% of this movie. Up until half- way trough I honestly considered walking away from this boring tragedy which is the lack of creative talent on the part of the script writers and director. There are also very obvious holes in the plot, and not just irregularities but direct contradictions that even the most obnoxious sic-fi movies at least try to amend somehow.I can not help but think that after watching Automata which was a breath of fresh air in many regards, this movie is like walking into a small toilet where someone just took a huge dump. It is literally that bad. What saves this movie by the skin of its teeth is the ending. So just watch that instead, because until then you could have just as well been watching an episode of Santa Barbara.Spolers about ridiculous plot holes (as if the soap part of the movie is not stressed enough): 1) The stupid Dust Bowl recycled. Seriously? I am not even going to try to explain this because I'd need to re-post have of Wikipedia here, but it does not work that way. Not in the past - not in the future. 2) The moment NASA abducts the main character and daughter and questions them. Seriously? Maybe they should also have shot them on sight? 3) NASA's facility is top secret! Right... in the age supposedly after the present, when there are drones and google maps, they manage to hide a huge facility in some old James Bond villain fashion. 4) ""LET'S GO TO ANOTHER GALAXY!"". OK if the movie shows a fairly conventional rocket, carrying a futuristic ""shuttle"", WHY for the love of all holy would anyone risk going there - instead of looking in our own? What, they really expected to have better luck there - than in our own? They already searched the entire Milky Way? And what's even better - it ""just so happens"" there is a planet like a stone's throw away from the black hole and is NOT being consumed by it, and somehow a black hole which is now proved to be a collapsed star is anything BUT a collapsed star? Why... let's just start diving down toilets, because you know, they are not full of s*** but are actual doorways to different dimensions! Like dimensions of dementia perhaps! 5) Saving the best for last - I did like the ending. Despite its absurdity I did like it. Almost cried - if I were a 14 year old girl with especially fragile psychology, but I digress. The ""machine"" that allows the main character to conviniently contact his daughter in the future- past, is built by... the very humanity he is trying to save, that survived, and built the machine in the future. Lord have mercy, I will try to explain this... So basically if we consider all major theories about time travel, in order to change the future one must go there and change it, right? But here the future changes the past, and that past is what changed the future with the help of the future that is changed in the past with the changed future's help. Mind >>> blown!"
74," Gem of a Movie!
","Interstellar, Another feather in Nolan's cap, This movie is surely one of the Nolan's finest blend, it had everything that makes you glued to the seats and those nail biting moments I can watch it again and have the same feeling as watching it for the first time, and don't be fooled by some idiots claiming that the movie is way too technical and you need to brush up your Physics before watching the movie, don't fall for this bullshit, the movie is clear and concise and well not to mention but just like any other Nolan movie this one also leaves much to your interpretation and I believe that's what makes the movies of Nolan stand out from others, it's all about IMAGINATION with a good bit of science and what could very well be a reality, I don't want to spoil it for you by revealing any interesting parts of the movie, I would recommend the movie to anyone who loves watching fiction movies that makes you believe in the fiction they portray, yes we are far from the reality, but when you are in there watching this movie, those 3 hours you become a part of the movie and it becomes the reality, few movies have given me such experience in the past, and this one definitely tops the chart!"
75," Ridiculous
","this movie was awful, I was deceived by the fake rating. it was full of pseudoscience, so superficial and boring. every single minutes could be challenged by a science professional. being a PhD student in science, I envy SciFi script writers and directors that they can pop up any bullshit and be praised by non-professional audience. such a ridiculous robot, underground NASA that launches billion dollar projects in famine a condition, the huge tide on that planet without considering the depth of water, entering the black-hole unprotected, LOVE being the 5th dimension, contacting through black-hole by pushing the books! Oh my! can anybody be more superficial about science? my advice to anybody who has a critical mind: don't waist your time."
76," Thought-provoking adventure,
","This movie felt like it tried to accomplish two simultaneous and somewhat incompatible endeavors.First, it was thought-provoking. Many questions were raised. What would life on earth be like if our climate runs amok? What happens to government when we all have to live hand-to-mouth? Are ""they"" out there communicating with us? Is it the essence of humanity to survive, or is it to pioneer, and, by extension, evolve? Second, it was also an adventure. I watched this in a full IMAX theater, with eighty bajillion watts of Super Thunder-Round Sound, or whatever the kids call it now. The visual effects definitely shine on the IMAX screen. The format switches occasionally, and usually imperceptibly, between 70mm for the scenes with dialogue, to IMAX format for that full-on dose of retina-overload spectacle. This movie is a wonderfully fun ride through a strangely familiar extra-galactic world. There are also plenty of tense moments, after which you realize you've been holding your breath.I'm glad I went to watch this. That said, I think the film suffers a little from trying to be both an adventure thrill about the dangers of space travel, let alone an actual confrontation with a nemesis, and also a multi-layered allegory involving the dimensional tangle of time, gravity, love, and what it means to survive.It asks more questions than it explores. While it fills in for the missing answers with white-knuckled brushes with death, it wasn't as intellectually satisfying as I hoped. I spent an hour discussing the thoughtful components with a friend. In the end, we were grasping to find symbolism, metaphors, or other messages about humanity. We never coalesced ""the message"" of the movie.But did we need to? It was, as I said, also a thrill ride. The adventurous climax was a little less than terrifyingly dramatic; I can't say I had the same post-climactic cathartic experience as I've had for other movies. But it was a definite end, closing most of the open plot points. I certainly felt moved by the characters' resolutions.I was suspicious that Matthew McConaughey could convince me that he was a space-ready engineer; it turns out that he didn't need to, because he did convince me that he was a dad that loved his children as much as any dad could. I think all the leads delivered solidly: Caine, Lithgow, Hathaway, Damon, Chastain, Affleck... I connected with the characters and felt their pain and happiness.Hans Zimmer played up the drama in the music a little heavily, I thought, and unnecessarily. It wound up creating the opposite of the effect I think he intended. Many of the scenes could have used a lighter touch, musically. Some of them worked brilliantly.Although I had my quibbles, the final analysis is that I would definitely choose to watch the movie a second time, but I'm not making plans to, for now."
77," Mediocre
","Interstellar is mediocre. The story is chock full of cheap clichés (""Love is the 5th dimension!""), over-layered with arcane science for believability and story points that are never explained.The movie makes sense until Matt Damon. Up to that point, the quantum mechanics and astrophysics hold up, more or less. Although If you know you're going to age by 5 to 15 years on the water planet, why leave that one poor guy on his own? It's kind of heartless and that's when I started doubting the movie. But OK, fine. I can live with that.Then they head for the ice planet. And, all of a sudden, ""gravity is the force that transcends time"" and ""your mind fights death so you can see your children"".All downhill from there, way into deep space 9. The movie takes a turn for the worse: A nonsensical allegory about how humanity can be saved thanks to the power of love between a father and his daughter. It's endearing, but incomprehensible.Granted, the movie's pretty. So I gave it two stars. The actors? Love all of them. That's another 2. But I simply cannot live with a script that's nonsensical and full of stuff we're supposed to take at face-value, because it's Christopher Nolan, and he's an otherwise brilliant director: What was Michael Caine trying to not solve? What is all the research about? And, sci-fi directors: Please, drop the blackboard and chalk cliché. We technology people use computers now. Blackboards were useful when Newton was running things. Now? Not so much.It sounded like (but I'm not really sure) the five dimension bookcase, which lost me completely, was invented by humanity in a very distant future as a communications device. But then I also have to assume that that future humanity has really awesome technology if it can pull that kind of prowess. Then, why not simply invent a cellphone that can bridge time? Why not just send an email with the data component that's missing? Why would anyone have to take a chance taking a dive into a black hole to get it? And how is that future humanity saved anyway? And: How does the robot, whose location in space is never explained, come in possession of that data? And do 21st century communications really work in a black hole? Going back to the Michael Caine thing: What's the precious data component that he was missing? What does the ghost send in binary format to his daughter? (sounds to me like a lot of zeros and ones).And how does humanity get saved? Do they invent some sort of galactic Noah's ark to get people off the smoking pile of carcinogenic garbage that Earth has become? Could they not do that before? I'm sure they could.How does a human being in a space suit even survive flying into a black hole? Or maybe that's not what happened. I'm just not sure. The list goes on and on. the movie is a confusing hodge-podge of pseudo-philosophical-pseudo-scientific mess full of circular logic and loose ends. It's intended for (1) sci-fi dorks who tend to not over-think things (2) Nolan worshipers and lovers of all things shiny (3) movie ""buffs"" who enjoyed Cloud Atlas, which was more boring and more bizarre than Interstellar, but only slightly."
78," No words
","As a sci-fi fan, who loves 2001 SO, Contact, Gravity and many other movies that deal with with the topics also covered in Interstellar, I have to say, I have no words to describe the movie. It just took me for one hell of a ride! The score provided by Hans Zimmer was an extraordinary piece of work. It fits the movie so well that it was like the movie was made to fit the OST and not the other way around. There is an interview with Christopher Nolan, in which he states that he wouldn't allow Hans Zimmer to know exactly what the movie's plot device is, he only told to him that he has to focus on the connection between father and daughter. If this is the truth - WOW! it worked flawlessly!I won't go and describe what I saw on the big screen because this is something that anyone that goes to see the movie has to experience for himself... I can only tell you that after I saw the credits, I attempted to get off my seat, it didn't worked. I tried again, pushing harder - it barely worked. Moments after I was at the theater's exit heading out for the bus. I saw it coming just right on time with me, but I didn't get on. I was compelled to walk and think. Think of what I saw... My head was aching, my ears too and my eyes were closing only to call back images from the movie. I got home and found myself undressed and dressed with my casual home clothes. Then I realized that I have also walked the 7 kilometers road to my home without noticing... I was still in the movie, I must definitely been, because only there the time behaved the way I was feeling while coming home..."
79," Massively overrated (or over-retarded)
","I liked Inception a lot and was expecting something similar from Nolan brothers, but Interstellar turned out to be massively disappointing. It's too long, too boring, too sloppy and too hard to believe what all fuss is about.Earth is overpopulated and plants are dying from drought, dust is everywhere and starting to be a problem. This is all what we were told by a movie, everything that we should know (they think). So instead of trying to solve these problems by inventing new food forms, by ocean water demineralization or just soft decreasing of population to numbers Earth can sustain best minds came up with ingenious plan - go through suddenly discovered wormhole and see what happens. Instead of sending drones they sent bunch of people through to a no-return mission, three having reported of habitable planet each.It is when things started to become interesting. NASA picks up some random guy pilot (McConaughey) to lead mission to these three planets, all of them coincidentally in the same system, orbiting a black hole. COME ON, three planets orbiting a black hole? If you want to live here, you might be insane. However, in a retarded fashion he decides to leave his young daughter on dying earth to pursue his all-life-mission. Some more absurd plot decision happens when he then decide to land planet with such twisted space-time (because it is near blackhole, remember - we are watching movie pretending to make sense scientifically) that it has time accelerated 60000 times comparing to earth. Nothing very interesting happens next, three non-essential persons just die, Matt Damon being one of them by going nuts for absolutely no reason. In the end McConaughey diving into a black hole (finally making sense sequence) leaving only one woman in a mission (Hathaway) to land a planet she wanted first were her supposed lover landed previously. And while soundtrack plays loudly to draw attention from following absurd plot twist, main hero spends 60 years in another dimension translating quantum equations to his daughter on Earth which will solve all problems and allow six billions people to escape. By the way all these years everyone was just waiting, absolutely no one bothered to send more expeditions so busy they were all solving Einstein equations.Why so silly? With so many numerous big and small plot holes this can't be serious movie. Main hero acting like a retard (or actually he is), his daughter soon-big-girl solving biggest scientific problem in history, two absolutely useless crew members with funny robot as a company and a woman supposed to be main-hero's girlfriend, a lier as main scientist and a bunch of another useless people. Even CGI can not save the day. We were told that black hole CGI supposed to be most realistic than ever, but it was pictured in roughly 1.5 scenes at best. Soundtrack is fine, but it is played so loudly, in disharmony with deep space atmosphere and in some scenes being unnecessary as well. So what we have in the end? It just looked like they tried to make big, really BIG move about space travel and physic phenomenons, but somehow missed big picture and not really payed attention to the details, ignoring common sense which eventually led to a failure. Sadly, good opportunity to create such movie in the uncharted territory was wasted."
80," Not sure what the fuss is about
","Not a terrible movie but not half as good as some reviewers would have you believe. Firstly a lot has been made of you needing a degree in quantum physics to understand the movie. Not so, the premise is exactly the same as his last move 'inception', time moves slower the deeper you go or in this case nearer the event horizon of a black-hole. Don't need to be a genius to understand that.Secondly a lot has been made of his revolutionary mixing of 'dazzling' science fiction and an intimate human story. As for the human story, it's clunky and at times cringe-worthy. It's dull and not particularly well handled with amateurish dialogue characteristic of the Nolan films. If you want to see a movie where the relationship between father and daughter is far better handled watch 'Contact'. As for the science fiction I'd have to say I was disappointed. Parts were very spectacular but I was not impressed by the planet scenes. Iceland yet again and a water planet with shallow seas and massive waves? I was somehow expecting more than this.Overall grossly over-rated by the critics yet go and see it all the same."
81," Nolan does an Armageddon
","SPOILER FREE BEGINS *********I had a sneaking feeling that Christopher Nolan was a director who wasn't particularly good at staging emotional sequences, nor had a special skill in staging action sequences nor has consistency in his screen writing which may range from mediocre (The Dark Knight Rises and overall logical setup of the Batman series) or sublime (Memento, Inception). What always worked for Nolan was that his movies were always interesting and always intriguing and if the script was any good, he made classics.Interstellar represents a colossal failure of Nolan on every front imaginable. Let's start with the plot which is the most looked forward thing in his movies. The plot involving the World's end and the attempt to save it via Interstellar travel is so hokey that you may think you are watching a Michael Bay movie. If you could complain about ""Gravity""s leaps of logic, then you will realize there is absolutely no physical logic in this script. The story is a Galaxy sized plot hole. The sad part is that it isn't even original which you would come to expect from the Nolan Brothers. It's a bad mishmash of Gravity, Coherence, 2001 a Space Odyssey and Contact book ended by a cringe inducing emotional thread that it will compel you to flay your hands in the air over the inept acting, dialogues, staging, and poor editing, story and what not. If you were expecting an ""Inception"" than don't, Interstellar has the most contrived sci- fi plot in existence coupled with bad acting. It's Armageddon with a sense of higher purpose. At least I enjoyed Armageddon.SPOILER FREE ENDS ********Now back to the plot points. Lets talk about the plot. The world is ending, and I could not fathom why, nor could Nolan show us the World in a broad sense apart from one single corn field farm in the middle of nowhere which conveniently houses an ultra secret project by NASA. If the world is ending, who will save it? Of course the ""Aliens"" or ""They"" (insert oooooooooooh). I thought the movie would involve humans discovering Interstellar travel.I never went into the movie thinking that a huge big ass Worm Hole was conveniently placed by 5- Dimensional unexplained aliens as a convenient plot device to jump into the whole space travel thingy. How hokey is that? And the hokum continues with supremely bad exposition ever committed on screen with fellow astronauts explaining how worm holes work (""Ah it's shaped like a sphere!) or how time dilation works in relativity theory. It seems like none of Johnathan or Christopher could truly grasp how these concepts should work in the context of the film and hence these appear as contrived elements in the service of producing cheap thrills (""oh we lost so many years"").And talking about cheap thrills, can anyone possibly out there condone how stupid the middle reveal was with our famous cameo from a famous actor? Okay let's talk about the ending. One can apparently fly into a black hole, make contact with 5-Dimensional entities who will present you a menu of quantum states of possibilities in order to save the world by how? How? By transmitting some mumbo-jumbo data via Morse Code through a ticking hand of a watch to a woman on the other side of the space time continuum so that she can umm fit it into the equation? or was it a constant? what is a 5 pager formula? How did it work? Hokey as hell.And the visuals? Oh the problem is since Gravity came out and took the crown of the best space visuals in the last 5 years, what could Instellar do? Well lets have some obviously fake looking CGI dust clouds. Have your space ship fly over a Windows wallpaper of Saturn. How was any of it ""Original""? Let's look at the planet. One has Water with a fake wall of waves, one has simply ice. That's it. Water and Ice. Where did you spend your money on Mr Nolan? Oh the Robots were hilarious but you would cringe in your seats thinking how a rectangular block of moving pillar was a good Robot Design and how the poor chap was managing to run on flat ground.And the acting? Cringeworthy Mumblecore.I don't think even the fanboys can save this one."
82," Lame-o!
","Here's its 2 stars...I saw it in IMAX so I enjoyed going through the wormhole. Other than that? Well, let's get started...It's so typical - almost clichéd! - the way billions of dollars are spent on the visuals of movies these days and zero dinero on the script. Interstellar is a prime example of this. It just might be the definitive example.I'm not going to go into the science much because I'm a tad science- and space-illiterate but even I could see glaring holes in this tripe. For one thing, what kind of impossible tidal forces create a mile- high tidal wave out of 2 feet of water? Why weren't drones sent into the wormhole instead of people? That corn looked pretty green to me, didn't you think so? What's going on in London or Montreal or Buenos Aires or anywhere other than Kansas? Is Kansas the last place anyone is? Can't the black guy just once make it to the end of the movie? Why is NASA housed inside the Bonaventure Hotel? (okay sorry, I'm from LA and recognized it right away)Did Matt Damon owe someone a role and that's why he's in this tripe giving the worst performance of his career? Why weren't Matthew M's grandchildren and great grandchildren the slightest bit interested in him? Who the hell cast Matthew M in this? How was it possible to relay ""tapes from loved ones at home"" across those distances but nobody could relay anything back? What was up with that stupid robot?Okay, forgetting science and crazy-ass tesseracts for a moment...the human element of the script was incredibly eye-rolling. Remember that notoriously stupid moment in Armageddon when Liv Tyler screams ""That my father up there!""? Well the entire ""human"" aspect of this story and all the dialogue seemed to be written by whomever wrote that classic line. What was so wrong with treating the audience like intelligent people and giving then a straight, highly scientific, awe-at-the-majesty-of-the-universe, harsh reality sci-fi film that didn't insult you at every turn instead of this z-grade soap opera with neat-o visuals?"
83," Worst sf film in 20 years
",This film is an anti-intellectual zenith. It is offensive at least for someone who has a rudimentary knowledge of astrophysics and the theory of relativity. I have never seen such s-f movie full of nonsense. At least in the last 20 years. Every single law of physics is broken or adjusted to Hollywood pulp. Ethical problems concerning time travel were already discussed 60 years ago. Medea/Gaia hypothesis is an old fairy tale. Pseudo- philosophical use of feelings with respect to the multi-dimensional time-space is simply ridiculous. Situations that occur in the vicinity of the event horizon: I can only say: serious case of ignorance. And standard use moral treatise about human nature based on common sense is too obvious. Someone who makes movies based on comic books shouldn't be allowed to make a s-f movie. Really bad choice!! I am disappointed. Very disappointed. 1 point is for the robots. Best regards.
84," 3 hours stolen
","Seriously? Some people are rating this 10? I'm no physicist but I do have a basic understanding of what is within the realms of possibility. Firstly, the first line of the synopsis of this film on IMDb. Scarcity of food on planet earth due to drought and famine? What? Sorry,but no. On our planet we are currently storing seeds in a massive archive from countries all over the world. Even North Korea. They're being stored underground and kept at a very low temperature. Also, we can grow vegetation without sunlight. There are many people doing this today. So why, if for any reason, would we be risking our crops to this unexplained environment? This is just the first problem I have with this film. At no point was it explained of what the cause of this global famine was. I want to know, and I waited for 3 hours for an explanation that never came. Secondly, forgoing the wormhole, if gravity is that strong to slow down time, you'd be crushed, and waves wouldn't even exist. Let alone 100 foot waves. Thirdly, the robot. Why oh why is it a box that seemingly can move over any terrain? Throughout the film the same joke. Humour level at 75%? Sarcasm rating at 80%? Oh yes these ""jokes"" came thick and fast. The only joke I could see is that this film was actually made and I wasted 3 hours of my life. If you want to watch a brilliant sci fi, with Matthew Maconaghy, watch Contact. It was made in 1997 and was written by the famous cosmologist, Carl Sagan. Now that's worthy of a 10. The only good point about Interstellar was the visuals married to the brilliant soundtrack. If you want that, then go to a light show or concert. Sad to say, I'm greatly disappointed. Nolan should stick with Bat man."
85," More plots holes than swiss cheese & a total waste of the 70mm film it was shot on.
","This has got to be the stupidest, most absurd, ridiculous movie I have ever seen in my life. There are so many ludicrous, illogical leaps in this movie that it would take days to mention them all, days. Nothing made sense from a logical standpoint in the entire film. Not one thing. Absolutely nothing in the script worked. Every aspect of it was so ludicrous that I was rolling my eyes, throwing up my hands or even laughing out loud throughout the whole thing. Masterpiece my ass. And the comparisons to 2001, give me a break. If you think this film is thought provoking you have an IQ of less than zero. A total waste of the 70mm film it was shot on."
86," Pretty disappointing...
","Like many other reviewers, I'm giving this a 1 in a feeble attempt to balance out all the unwarranted 10s I keep seeing, even though I really think it deserves a 5, or maybe a 6. I actually created an account just to do this, so I figured I might as well include a review along with my rating.Many will say try to tell you that you shouldn't attempt to compare this movie to 2001, that they are two totally different movies, etc. This is ridiculous; they are quite similar on multiple levels, with Interstellar obviously taking many cues and inspirations from Kubrick's masterpiece. I feel that if we compare the two, we can get a good idea of where Nolan's film went wrong. The main reason 2001 has remained so powerful and held up so well is that it doesn't try to explain and rationalize everything that happens. We see the events of the movie unfold, but as the movie nears its psychedelic conclusion, we are really left to our own guesswork as to what is going on. Has he entered another dimension? An alternate universe? An alien spacecraft? Is he just dead? The mere fact that we have no idea whether this scene depicts something spiritual, something scientifically quantifiable, or a mix of the two makes it so much more moving than if Kubrick had tried to explain it through the available science of his time.Interstellar answers far too many questions, which, as is often the case, ends up raising infinitely more. Nolan makes it clear from the get go that this film is supposed to function on more of an emotional level than a scientific one. Then why even bother have the film ""fact checked"" by a astrophysicist? Why create this confusing mixture of real- and pseudo- science in the first place? To me, in a lot of scenes this kind of shatters the air of mysticism Nolan seemed to be going for. The ""floating bookcase in a black hole"" sequence, for instance, seemed really magical until Cooper suddenly has a bunch of epiphanies and becomes positive that the structure was created by future humans, not aliens, that they created it specifically for him so he could navigate 5D and communicate with his daughter, and that he can save the world only by manipulating a watch with gravity. BOOM. There goes all the mystery. And lets assume his theory is correct, and this structure was indeed constructed by mankind from the future. Hmmm, guess it turns out that we didn't perish from constant dust storms after all—instead we survived hundreds of thousands of years into the future and went on to create mind-blowing, interdimensional space technology. Then what exactly is future us so worried about? They seem to be doing just fine without any alteration of the past. This is just the tip of the iceberg as far as far as all of the inconsistencies and unanswered questions you'll find in this movie. If you have a very analytical mind, steer clear of it—I am not a mathy or science-y person by any stretch, yet even I struggled at times to put my logic in the backseat and just enjoy the ride.That's what I'd advise you to do if you want to have a good time watching this movie: DON'T OVERTHINK IT. If you can just do that, you'll find an entertaining film with truly stunning visual effects, a great (if maybe a LITTLE too over the top) score from HZ, and very convincing performances from the actors. I found some scenes very moving. I liked the concept of a future that, as a result of a technological lull, doesn't look very different from our present. There are a lot of positive things to say about this film, and yet the end result is, sadly, maybe just a couple pegs above mediocre."
87," Disappointing
","So, did I get this right? The essence of time-space relativity is that you're able to see a younger version of yourself from behind a bookcase, and shout in vain that you shouldn't do what you're about to do? Yes, that's how silly this movie is. 'Interstellar' is supposed to be a film exploring Einstein's relativity theory. It shows how space travelers enter a 'wormhole' to find new planets where they can find a future for mankind, which is suffering from heat, drought and hunger on planet Earth. By doing so, they enter a parallel time frame where one hour equals seven years on earth. The problem is that the film is tackling this subject in such a clumsy way that it makes you laugh rather than anything else. Take the robots that assist the space travelers during their voyage through time and space. Are we really to believe that thinking computers in the future would take the form of clunky metal boxes, assembled in such a way that they can walk on two legs? I would suppose an intelligent operating system for a smart phone or iPad would be much more convenient. In that respect, 'Her' was much more realistic. I could go on. How about a top scientist saying things like: 'Only love transcends time and space, so why don't we put our trust in that?' Or how about handing the command of the space ship that's supposed to save the human race to a farmer who finds the secret launching pad by coincidence? And how about the only woman in the crew being in love with another space traveler who is lost somewhere on another planet? Apart from this, there are several other things about this film I didn't like. The over-the-top soundtrack, filled with some sort of church organ music. The artificial dialogues, mostly intended to explain unexplainable things. The numerous melodramatic and tear-jerking scenes. The subtle message that love is superior to science. The countless scenes of the space ship shuddering and rattling, as if it were a Boeing flying through a patch of turbulence. I had hoped this big budget production by a talented director like Christopher Nolan could appeal to non sci-fi fans like me. But I was disappointed."
88," What a Waste of Space
","This truly is a shocking movie and must rank as the worst sci-fi film I have ever had the misfortune to waste 2.5hrs on.The acting is appalling with some quite amateurish edits. The music drowns out a lot of the dialogue, which is probably just as well considering its triteness. The whole premise of the plot seems to have been cobbled together by the writers after they'd endured an overkill of everything from the Lost in Space TV series of the sixties (though at least that show injected some humour into the proceedings), through to 2001 A Space Odyssey, and the innumerable Star Trek programmes and films.Any movie that casts Michael Caine as a scientific boffin must be struggling for starters. He utters, in one excruciatingly and barely decipherable scene, ""I lied"". Well he certainly didn't act! Anne Hathaway struggles to make any sense of the quite ludicrous script and often appears that she'd rather be undergoing root-canal work, whilst Matthew McConaughey mumbles and fumbles his way through lines he can't quite believe he is expected to say.The continuity is confusing and the 'special effects' only reach mediocre, adding absolutely nothing new in this genre for the viewer.I have watched hundreds of sci-fi films and programmes and do realise that we are expected to suspend belief to a greater extent, which is why a little humour would not have gone amiss - but every character in the movie seemed to be so darn miserable and brimming with angst. This film has no redeeming features whatsoever; one develops no empathy for any of the players, and there were a couple I longed would perish within a few minutes of them being introduced into the storyline (the child who portrays the ten-year old Murphy to name but one).Sorry, but this film is not worthy of wasting over two hours of your precious life on. There again, you are quite entitled to think otherwise...."
89," Shoot me
","Previously having been a fan of a few of Nolan's films that actually were the opposite of what this film is - masterpieces, I peeked at the ratings here on IMDb. However had I scrolled further down to see where they were coming from and what the reviews really were, I probably would've discovered the truth and not have decided to take the inevitable trip into this black hole with Nolan and suffer, something I am extremely embarrassed about and will always be haunted for. Unfortunately I cannot get the three hours of my life taken away by this film. Do not watch this.At a great probability, an atrocious waste of money went into making this because I couldn't help but question where it all went. It probably went into a black hole. Common sense was extremely uncommon in the entire film and to an extent that would actually anger you, making you wonder how stupid the director thinks of you otherwise. Like plenty others, I felt a necessary urge to be informant about this tragedy and so created an IMDb account just to write this. Not surprisingly, I found that a lot of others have already said most of what I wanted to say about the film.I'm going to try to sum up some scenes, shortened to the best of my ability that would give you an idea of how awful this movie really was and how dreadful my time went sitting through it all hoping to find a little substance somewhere down the line, being a patient guy. On the real this movie is not even worth your 10 dollars on a DVD rental. You'd probably sleep through all of it in any case.So I spend twenty dollars to go see this and upon the first ten minutes I find myself looking back at my life wondering where I had gone wrong to deserve this. To begin with, the start of this film with Mathew McConaughey on some unknown farmland somewhere and who knows where, does not create any picture or lead you anywhere for you to even develop one on your own, to get a hold of whether an 'Interstellar' will actually begin to unfold or whether not. Our lead, with his kids drives his truck off road down on to fields of corn ( with a flat tire ) to follow what seems to be some ""Nasa test drone/ robot plane"", as soon as he spots it randomly flying in the air. So he drives with his kids for say over twenty minutes with the flat as his car runs down heavy bushes of corn fields, where he commands his kid son to ""take the wheel"" while he moves in the backseat now to turn on his laptop through which he has decided to and even knows how to track this drone! From this point on I tried hard to stay awake. He later just happens to stumble upon a Nasa base that also happens to be only minutes away from where he lives. I steady awake to the part where our hero gets out the car outside the Nasa base with blinding lights in front of him. Next, he gets whacked by a robot, taken hostage and then wakes up in front of Anne Hathaway, inside the base. Then you've got Michael Caine telling him that he is ""the chosen one"" to fly a rocket in spite of the fact that Matthew mistakenly discovered the base. After exchanging a few words, our hero seems fit to be the pilot of the rocket ship ( without real training ) for a mission everybody is newly introduced to. What is this mission about? To go find another planet that would sustain life because Earth is no longer going to be a hospitable place in a few years although no one knows why. That is not it. Guess where they're all going to look for one? In a black hole. Forty minutes deep and you'll find that by now you'd rather walk out because it doesn't really matter anymore how the film turns out. Later nearing the end, McConaughey's ship is about to run out of fuel any minute where the ship explodes at full capacity leaving him to fall into the black hole to find himself in a five dimensional wall space. Here he communicates to Earth with the assistance of the robot that should've been destroyed in that ship, to his daughter through a wrist watch lying on her bedroom shelf at home and she happens to sense what is exactly going on Wow this was just terrible. Now, to all those of you who have the slightest idea of what a black hole is and what it does or doesn't do for that matter, do not waste your time watching this even on DVD. In fact, make sure you do not waste your hours even watching it for free on television shortly soon because it would make you so sad, scared and bored all at the same time like you couldn't believe.Not one minute of this film was ""possible"" if you like, even bit by bit, to create any practical sense of what went on or even what could have come out of it.This movie was so bad I came out paralyzed. To my horror, I'm left with no words to describe the experience and I'm only trying.I consider myself pretty tough after having the courage to sit entirely through and not walk out within the first twenty minutes like I should have done."
90," One of the most ludicrous films ever made
","Truly one of the most ludicrous films ever made. Virtually every moment of the film comprises a series of linked premises without any one of them having a rational basis. The film depends upon multiple concepts regarding space-time and space travel, most of which the audience is sufficiently familiar with to appreciate the potential story .... BUT ... each one of those is then formulated and entered into the storyline in a way that you cannot suspend belief. The series of presumptions just accumulate one ludicrous outcome after another, just in time to be posted straight into another ludicrous presumption. So what builds is a stack of preposterous situations that can really only be ""resolved"" by yet another, even more ludicrous outcome. This causes the late stages of the film to become so disjointed that the basic premise collapses.Note that the suspension of belief is, of course, fundamental to many films - in Star Trek for example, one suspends belief in accepting that faster than light travel is possible - or falling asleep inside your own dreams is believable, as in Inception - and that's AOK because the rest of the action is consistent. However, the number of presumptions you have swallow in Interstellar, that have no basis in science fiction or reality, strains credulity way past breaking point. One at least has to see a consistency for a film to be acceptable. Notwithstanding these comments, the individual elements are each highly watchable and Nolan does his usual blinding (literally in couple of the shots) best. The environments and space scenes are quite breathtaking. However, watching the film is a cascaded cataclysm of ideas, concepts, half-theories, impossibilities, broken linkages and downright wrongness, that appears on the screen like confetti in a gale. The disappointment is that the cast of actors is sensational, and they do everything they can to make the film a coherent ""reality"" .... but the outcome it to make them look like patsies to a conspiracy ...Possibly the only saving grace is the final 38 seconds - where the original one-line film-pitch made to the money-boys gets played-out ... but it's probably too little, too late"
91," Interbollo..s
","Interstellar by Christopher NollanReviewed by Svetoslav GrigorovFirst, I had to look at the score on www.IMDb.com to confirm that all the rumors were true (9 out of 10): me and Paul were the only ones who didn't like this movie and left 45 minutes before it had finished. Whatever that means I can assure you that I was/am still sober and I am not a zombie like the rest of the crowd in the Kettering Odeon cinema. Secondly, I would like to ask how all these critics made the comparison(s) with Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey and thirdly, please you who now read this review tell me that I am not the only one in my dullest disappointment for the year. Tell me that I haven't lost my marbles, tell me that you were enthralled from this copy of a House On The Prairie and if you think that this is the best movie of your life (or at least 2014), the only answer I can think of is: that's why so many rubbish movies have been released lately. Because the level of the quality has fallen drastically and the conveyor belt of the movie industry is catastrophic for the senses. OK, so straight to the point. First 45 minutes we are introduced to the farming, dust and the coming famine problems, nitrogen on the rise in the atmosphere, Earth is doomed, father and daughter found a super-secret location that NASA strategically placed for their eyes only. We see a lot of corn and even the nineties Children of The Corn was a better shallow slasher while this one turns out to be an American clichéd space marmalade, and my best fitting comparison for it is Armageddon which is not really a movie, but a joke. Wormholes, saving of the human kind, bringing resources, planting/replanting, Plan A /Plan B, frozen embryos to colonize a distant world, overcoming gravity, scientists and even a quantum physics and so much camera- philosophy that Kubrick will turn in his grave, daddy-please-don't-go-to-space-cause –I'm- gonna-cry, bam the watch on the floor (I don't wanna see you anymore), counting while going into the stratosphere, Lego-robot which somehow was better acting than the rest of the actors or at least was more fun. Wait, wait, did I say actors? Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway and Michael Caine (The rest of them are not worth mentioning apart from the crying daughter Murph who did her best job).Matthew McConaughey has one of the most annoying twangs ever and his jaundiced bad- version-face of Paul Newman cannot contribute to any script lately (let's not forget that without the help of Jared Leto and his masterful transformation in The Dallas Buyers Club his Oscar was going to hell). His mumbling could be understood only from the villagers in Kentucky and what he is on aboutSeriously, I needed subtitles to comprehend his actor's efforts in such a ""serious"" movie. How serious this movie was! I pushed myself to read couple of the 'serious' critical reviews and they had the audacity to call it ""scientific""??? Oh man, poor Anne Hathaway who looked sometimes at the camera and was likely apologizing for the mess she was in. I felt sorry for her.The script was the hell of the hells. Such nonsense with no credibility and no creativity at all. Total zero or even below the zero. As I said we left long before the end because my time is precious. I will open Isaac Asimov's (or Stanislaw Lem's) short stories and will be engulfed in characters and situations, so my brain will be given food for thought while all these poor people are going to see Interbol..cks and will be exposed on the radiation of a mediocrity (yes, I felt cheated like someone was trying to insult me). Well, if you who now read this review respect yourself and really like Kubrick, Moon, Gravity (and even Contact) and other good sci-fi don't waste your time and save your money. Today we wasted £40 including the drinks, the popcorn and the tickets and the only thing that I was inspired for was my generated anger for this text. My verdict on the scale from 1 to 10 is to give ONE for the director Christopher Nolan who needs a little encouragement and I am hoping he will not slip into the shoes of M. Night Shyamalan who have crafted a lot of rubbish lately as you know. God forbid that never happens.P.S.Don't tell me that I have sat there for 2 (it's actually 169 minutes) hours of a film and it had a great ending cause I don't want know."
92," Over Hyped
","Marketing gets a 10, paid promo reviews get a 10, and the film itself gets a 1. Once Matt Damon rears his ugly head you can now confirm your suspicions that this film has been compromised by illogical tripe. Damon delivers his usual trade mark wince and grimace to let the moviegoer know this script has changed yet again. The big lie is that this film is being hyped as a better science fiction movie than 2001, NOT. Anne Hathaway looks like a clueless deer in the headlights when she is supposedly a top astrophysicist. Matthew McConaughey plays a top mechanical engineer that is now a farmer due to a world filled with way too many people. The typical message from the Marxist Hollywood crowd is ever so present, the earth is turning into a dust bowel from global warming, kids can't follow their dreams as grade school will determine their careers (Outcome based Education), but it gets better when the Karl Marx penned phrase ""For the greater good"" is the basis of this long drawn out ball of crap called Interstellar. The IMAX presentation did nothing for this movie other than a soundtrack that made it difficult to listen to the actual dribble. Do yourself a favor and wait until this movie is released on DVD-BRay, the duality of your conscience demands it."
93," watch if your local pharmacy has run out of nytol.
","it seems that most people write their very first review after seeing the worst film of their lives, or after seeing the best. this is my first, driven to review to give a more honest rating and review than a 9.1.if you want to learn about physics, watch a documentary. if you want to be bored out of your mind for hours on end, then go and see interstellar. lead character mumbles 80% of the time (i thought it was just my hearing after being blasted with noise during the film at first). the use of sound is clever the first time, brash and loud, then deadly silent. but then it quickly becomes over used. scenes are so long and drawn out, this seems like a film a director wanted to make for his own viewing and ego. anne hathaway just looks tearful (you know the scene in snow white when she wandering about the forest scared of everything?) all of the time. I've never walked out of a film, and sadly couldn't this time (i didn't want to disturb the sleeping people around me you see...). if id been on an aisle seat, id have been gone after an hour. its not that the film is 'too clever', its just utterly boring."
94," Nolan, stick to Batman or go away!
","I'll try to be as objective as possible here, but unlike the premise of this film, you won't be able to travel through a wormhole and warn yourself of the impending waste of three hours.First, I'm not a SciFi fan, but rather (was) a Nolan fan, so I did want to give this film a chance. I don't claim to be a film expert by any stretch, but this movie reminded me of a similar experience with The Thin Red Line (1998) in that the entire film was a play on visual that subsequently lacked substance. Further, the visuals in this film were extremely boring! It's outer space, throw in something to look at, even if outside of textbook physics. With the exception of the black holes, it's literally black the entire time (or a Saturn backdrop)! They also poured in some heavy scores to make an attempt to glamorize the visual effects (or lack thereof).So Earth is dying, but they really never get into the why's and how's in an understandable fashion that would help to put into perspective the importance of finding another planet to live on. Life on earth seems to continue for decades after they start their mission, which only exemplifies my point. Unless Einstein himself wrote this script, the dialogue in this film is meant to be so over-the-top that nobody in the audience is meant to understand it, nor question it.I had an issue with the character development and lack of justifiable emotion. At no point in the film do you really care about any of characters because the storyline goes around like a hula-hoop. Good actors can't make up for their own lack of character development. Sure, Cooper cries when leaving his daughter, but he is on a spaceship up in outer space before his daughter can grab a tissue to wipe the tears away.I think what bothered me most, and fits the theme for lack of visual effort, were the stupid robots!!! They are basically chrome ATM machines with block appendages! If I was going to cram a bunch of people, and adequate supplies, into a spaceship, I wouldn't design the robotic assistance to be a huge box that takes up half of the cockpit! Pure visual laziness...R2-D2 was more interesting while being created 30 years ago. The more I write and think about this movie, the more I'm reminded of how awful it was. This to me was Hollywood hyping something up and ripping off movie goer's time and money!"
95," Cosmic
","Somehow, I'd missed ""Interstellar"" up to this point, so with the cinemas in the UK tentatively reopening after Covid shutdown, we decided that the IMAX presentation of the film would be a good way to ease ourselves back in to going. Whereas I had some issues with the film, as an IMAX presentation it was certainly an experience.Set in the near future, where a blight is systematically destroying all the crops of the Earth. The remnants of NASA launch a spaceship on a multiyear mission to investigate whether any planets on the other side of a newly appeared wormhole are suitable for human life. This ships designated pilot, Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) must decide whether to sacrifice time with his children in the hope of saving the human race.You can't argue that ""Interstellar"" isn't good. It is top notch in every aspect of filmmaking. The visual effects, the score, the performances are all spellbinding. This is one of history's greatest directors bring us his version of ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" - with all the layers, expressionism and concepts that the inspiration has. It also operates as Nolan's love letter to his daughter, about the time he sacrifices away from her to make his movies and how he feels about that. It is a masterpiece.All that said, I didn't love it. Not the way I have done other films, not in the way I have done other Nolan films - and I'm hard pressed to explain exactly why that is. I feel . . detached from it, somehow, maybe there's slightly too much going on? Maybe it's a little contrived at the end? Maybe it's a little too similar to ""Contact"" as well as ""2001""? I'm not sure. I can see the brilliance of it all, but it's something I appreciate rather than adore."
96," They!!!!
","The meaning of ""They"" was pointed very creatively in the movie.
Also very smartly, highlighted the reality of human tendency.

97," What a complete and utter waste of money
","This is weird... I love Science Fiction and I love astrophysics, but disliked everything about this movie. The start was extremely slow and it was hard to stay awake. The second half of the movie was somewhat better but felt like a very cheap rip-off of Space 2001. The movie just didn't do it for me at all and the acting was average. I'm totally flabbergasted that the average rating stands at 9 out of 10. Maybe audiences have lost the notion of quality, story-line, plot, acting, and uniqueness - as this movie doesn't have any of it. Ah well, I guess I'll just have to wait for the next SF movie and hope it will be somewhat better, because I am deeply disappointed by Interstellar as I expected so much more from a movie with an estimated budget of $165 million."
98," Calm down there, fan-boys.
","Don't get me wrong, I'm a sucker for most of Nolan's (and his brothers') works, but this one just doesn't rise up to the standard of filmmaking that we're used to from these guys. Where to start? The overtly obvious and cliché ending? If you've seen any movie involving space-time puzzles and paradoxes, you see it coming from miles away. One might say that's not the point of the movie, that we should rather see it as a story of love and affection and whatever. Well, sorry folks, the Nolans seem to talk the talk but they can't walk the walk. The ""dramatic"" content of this film is barely above that of a romantic comedy. It relies too heavily on time paradoxes but doesn't really give us the psychological background of the characters, as to why they do what they do. Some cliché shots: explanation of the worm hole is exactly the same as in Event horizon. The girl running after the car of the departing father, only to be held by another loved one, queue dramatic music- wow, I haven't seen that before. The ""beings"" (or us in the future) simplifying their reality so it suits our cognitive capacities-come on Matthew, you've done that movie already! The robots look like Monoliths from 2001. Well, if you're gonna be inspired by Kubrick, be inspired by the sheer emotional and psychological subtlety and precision that makes 2001 a masterpiece.""Human nature"" is a very easy answer to explain both all the evil and all the goodness that is going on. Yeah we have survival instinct, also compassion for our loved ones, which may come into conflict with the overall goal of our survival as species. So where are all these forced-tear-jerker scenes coming from? What else is new since 2001 or Solaris? Is that all there is to it? A movie with this much ambition and hype was supposed to be a milestone in the genre, but instead it is a faint copy, easily forgettable. What we've seen previously from these guys in films like The Following, Memento and also in Dark Knight, hell, even Inception, is that they really know how to create memorable characters with unique insight into their psychological background. None of that complexity is to be found in this movie. The characters are made from cardboard and they feel like repetitions of other sci- fi movie stereotypes. The dramatic substance of the movie, which is literally thrown to our faces every moment, does not live up to the quality of its' technical execution. Sure the visuals are great, but that's to be expected from a $169 million movie. Music is great too, though sometimes overused, but it's Hans Zimmer for crying out loud. What I enjoyed was the layout of the dystopic future, perhaps a little emphasis on how the world came to be that way would have made for a better and more plausible movie(don't even get me started on the absurd physics of this movie. good luck running from a black-hole).Simply put, this film is by no means a 9, and it simply doesn't qualify for the top250 (though of course there are many titles there which don't qualify even for the top875384)."
99," A great subject idea damaged by the plot and saved by Zimmer
","Even the title Interstellar evokes greatness, and the movie express this greatness through terrific photography supported by great picture quality (go to IMAX 70mm) and definitely communicated by soundtrack. Nolan knows that when you have Hans Zimmer on board you have an insurance: with his music you can transform even your dog daily service in an epic movie. Moreover the movie has a wonderful editing which give a great pace to the story. 9/10 on everything up to now. But when it comes down to the plot we barely reach 6/10. I will never understand why those Hollywood mega-productions that can do everything and have all these great subjects cannot avoid to make trivial mistakes across the plot. While looking at the movie it is like realizing that some good person had great ideas starting from the subject following with great details like the dust, the robots, the hibernation beds, and then somebody comes and place here and there some very simple mistakes. Here some:First of all,the whole thing does not add up: the first time Cooper leave earth, who sent him the NASA coordinate?? NON SENSE.second, at the starting of the movie you know the ending because too much emphasis has been placed on the message 'STAY'. I understand it adds a lot of drama to the departure scene but really spoils the ending. From there on you are only curious on how he will communicate back, which became clearer while watching the rest of the movie.Third, I loved the transition between the departure from home with the truck and the rocket launch BUT wait a moment. Three stages Saturn V rocket to reach the Earth orbit (..OK they were using spares from Apollo mission..OK..) and in all the rest of the movie these guys land and launch from 3 different earth-like planets by using simply the small spacecraft??? C'mon. Fourth, OK, you are trapped and the only person who can save humanity by communicating through time and what is the first thing you send to your daughter? Of course binary coded coordinates of NASA installation!! Not your name, not her name, but coordinates of the NASA launch site, so that the younger-yourself can LEAVE!If only all that you want is for him to STAY which is what you will send immediately after. OK maybe he do not know that he, him self, will start the whole thing just by following those coordinates..:/ WTF!!why?? Guys, I can understand you need to send Cooper to NASA, but couldn't you find something else?Fifth. This is minor, but really annoys me that in 2014, in the Interstellar production, you, screenwriters team, need AGAIN to make someone to slide and fall and trap her leg to create AGAIN the run-for-it-but-I-cant scene, on a planet in which every minute is a year wasted in the search for humanity salvation and to bring back some unknown data!? C'MON! You guys, have the best technicians and movie artisans, can afford almost everything you like, then again, why you have to slide on the banana peel? I will never understand."
100," I know i am currently in the minority but it was bad.
",I went to this film and all I can say is it was the longest technical demonstration of bullshit i have ever seen. I'm having a hard time writing about this film because I honestly wish I could forget about the film.The film has its strong points and those are visually appealing cinematography and an impressive use of sound. The negatives of this movie are however to many to put in a single review. The film has an alright beginning and the build up of the characters is done pretty well and you get to see Matthew McConaughey do some wonderful acting. However none of the characters were developed enough for you to care for them. However the movie jumped around so much from plot to plot that your emotions got shocked when very predictably a character gets killed but then the story moves right along with a nice action scene thrown in to keep you awake.The movie is full of quantum physics Jargon that no one could possibly follow. The jargon is about an hour of the movie and I have a fairly basic grasp on physics having taken a few college physics courses but I can say for a fact that many of the things might be true out of context but in the frame of the movie didn't make any sense I'm not writing anymore in this review i just recommend you go see another film. It felt like a waste of a good night to me but judging by the reactions of all the people in my theater you will probably find it a confusing a deep trip into breath taking quantum physics induced acid trip.
101," A cinematic mess!
","This film is an example of having to many irons in the fire and not knowing what to do with them, which results in an over sentimental mess that is called Interstellar. Nolan finally shows clearly his hubris in that he thinks of himself as a cinematic mastermind, in fact he's just a Hollywood pet with cheap tricks. There is nothing wrong in getting the science incorrect, a competent filmmaker manages to work around the incoherence and still create a unified whole, Nolan on the other hand wants us to think that he understands the science behind Interstellar, but he also shows clearly that he doesn't put much trust in the audiences' intellect. This results in an over abundance of exposition which is there just to inform us of how stupid we are. The sentimentality, which is most of the time laughable, doesn't go along with the overall structure of the film because the plot is disorganized. The problem comes from the inability to transform a concept into a film without allowing the audience to interpret what they are seeing - instead Nolan tries to overwhelm us with his elitist vision and it comes out as a mess because he doesn't trust his audience, he's lack of vision doesn't come from him not having a concept but from the inability to mediate that concept through a film, in other words: he is a bad filmmaker."
102," Watch it in IMAX . Thank me later.
","I believe that the film did more than enough justice to the science fact/fiction part of it. With this movie, Christopher Nolan tried to answer some questions that science is yet to. The transition form fact to fiction was seamless. Even though some of the sequences in the movie are open to scientific debate, they are simply beautiful - visually and emotionally. As far as the story goes, I could care less as the stunning visuals and great background score more than makes up for it. For those who are not fully satisfied with the story, I can understand, could be because of a very high bar set by Christopher Nolan himself. However, Don't let it hold you back if you like Nolan's movies.If you're gonna watch it, watch it in IMAX. ﻿"
103," Simply awful
","The most pointless pack of poo ever made. If you enjoy science fiction do not watch this dog under any circumstances.It was like a very long boring sappy, idiotic episode of the twilight zone.Gravity and time transmitted across dimensions, and lest we forget also love, FFS what kind of moron wrote this drivel.I guess that cosmically transmitted love is the reason there is no military in the future, even though resources are beyond scarce.And hmmmm what seems more difficult, using NASA's technology to transform a barely habitable planet circling a black hole, (with no sun FFS) or to transform, what was that other planet? Oh that's right Earth. I see no need to detail the rest of the stupidity of the ""physics"" in this movie. They should have simply made McMconaughey a wizard, it would have made more sense.But I must mention the magical space ship that can achieve escape velocity from a planet with 130% of Earth's gravity, ummm why didn't they use that rather than a massive 3 stage rocket to escape Earth?"
104," Dissymmetries, sight
","The good news that we have the brothers reunited and again working on circular narrative. Again, we have a powerful narrative arc that shifts in unexpected and engages in expected ways.The device is hackneyed: messages from the future, but is handled deftly. Where it is clumsy, we are competently distracted by narrative and visual process. The love story that drives this is novel enough to not fall into one of the three formulas commonly used for 'love,' (despite McConaughey) or two for father-rescues-daughter. We have a chosen child who saves the world by supernatural intervention, but again, this doesn't distract. These accomplishments alone make this worth experiencing because many devices are used to reset our expectations from formulas. Some fail horribly and that keeps this film from my absolute essential viewing list; I'll get to those in a moment. But all that are under the control of the filmmaker are so well considered that they bear mention.Take, for example the visual setting. The story itself is about the folding of time, but in a subtle way. The time of the story is in the future, but the setting is in the past. We refer to the dustbowl. All the cars, buildings, clothes and verbal expressions are vaguely from that era. We never see a brand that would pin down the time.More powerfully, the film itself is made as a science fiction film would be in the 50s-60s, using notions and tropes from that era. The robot is from ""Forbidden Planet."" The notion that a world-saving enterprise rests on the mathematical attempts of one man alone. That a vast enterprise is actually secret and located in one spot, with no suppliers. That construction of a spaceship requires welding sparks. That a heavy lift launch can occur in a building.Look at the computer screens. Nearly all are commandline interfaces. The switches and control panels are from the DEW line era. They haven't managed to use legacy fonts in the signage, but it looks like they avoided the most obvious: helvetica.Even the drone is a currently obsolete model. Underscoring all this is setting the film in Texas. Malick, and before him Bogdanovich, Hooper, Welles exploited the fact that Texas lives in two eras, sucking riches from the present while defining itself in some fictitious and better past.The film is also clearly in a future, after antiscience politicians have written technology out of the textbooks, denying the moon landing and forcing something named NASA underground. The ambiguity of time is conveyed subconsciously and works. I think they used some recorded interviews from the actual dustbowl era.But the flaw, the underlying decay in this film is in who they relied on for the science. They clearly separated the science of the adopted genre (noted above) from the science used in the actual extraterrestrial events. They chose renown physicist Kip Thorne as their authority.The man is an important scientist and reportedly very engaging. But the world of such scientists is divided between those who believe in the primary eminence of geometry and those who believe instead in ordered mechanics. This is a deep divide, highly polarized when the work gets going. Which is better for the problems at hand is irrelevant here. But which is better for cinematic depictions of encounters with the forces of the world well there is no contest and Noland chose unwisely. I may write about this. A good title may be the Carl Sagan effect.On other unrelated matters, some unresolved minor plot threads remain. The finished film exceeded the time budget for story-before-launch as it is, but we'd like to know what the reason for introducing the drone was and why it was important.A bit worse: In the film, we have a very hard won ability to send messages back in time, describing deep science from inside a black hole. I get that. But 'before' all those events, some other souls sent back messages and the physical artifact of the wormhole. Why not use that mechanism, unless the much-mentioned notion of the urges of love are essential to the bridge?"

Seems like humanity have forgotten that we can grow things in greenhouses and even underground. never mind lets move on, once again Nolan's characters all scientists and supposedly super intelligent do the most stupid things. anne hathaway goes in the water to retrieve a large piece of debris when a large wave appears, she has on hand a robot who could lift this wreckage with one hand but does not instruct him to do so, the beardy scientist is by the spacecraft door urging her to get a move on, the wave gets nearer the robot goes and carries her to the shuttle, the beardy scientist all this while stays put just outside the door and lets the wave carry him away, just one example of quite few.the biggest plot hole is this, for some reason once cooper is past the black hole and in 5 dimensional space, he becomes super intelligient, because he now knows how to solve the problem of gravity and save mankind, how he knows this we do not know, given that he is just an engineer to be able to figure out something the greatest physicists of the last hundred years cannot is unbelievable, he then sends probably the most complicated and long equation in history to his daughter in basic morse code, anyone familiar with morse code will tell you that this would take forever. now to the film making, others have mentioned its look , well to me it looked shabby, endless shots of aircraft wings, no vistas no shots of the galaxy or stars. during both the wormhole sequence and the black hole sequence he stays on the actors in close. in fact thank God i did not see this in imax, would have been a complete waste of time. and now the noise, with hans zimmer's worst and most bombastic score , added onto very loud sound effects, with the actors shouting to be heard we came a away with very bad headaches. the end did not make any sense at all. but we have the usual nolan fan base that cannot see past their noses all going ape over this and the usual batch of critics with no critical faculties whatsover."
106," Long, dull and WAY overpraised
","A simple farm guy named Copper (Matthew McConaughey) and a few other experts go into outer space to explore other worlds that might sustain human life. It seems that that life on Earth might not survive due to to some unexplained environmental disaster. Naturally nothing goes right.WAY overpraised and terrible sci-fi movie. When I heard the plot from this I expected the worst. Writer/director Christopher Nolan has never been a favorite for me--I HATE what he did to Batman in his movie trilogy. I thought that he as trying to imitate Stanley Kubrick (""2001"") here but it's far worse--he's doing Steven Spielberg! The movie runs WAY too long (165 minutes) and they're constantly pushing family friendly values in your face. Cooper's non-stop yammering about his daughter got on my nerves instantly. Also that stupid fake southern accent he adopts is immediately annoying. The story is very slow and all the characters are cardboard cutouts you've seen in other movies. The special effects are flawless and there's some beautiful cinematography here but the extreme length and boring story really weigh it down. Any sort of statement they're trying to make on time and life is completely deadened by the script. Also this movie is very manipulative and way too sentimental. They go out of their way to make the audience cry--like at a Spielberg movie. Well I did cry--tears of joy at the end that this was over! Also the gaps in logic and plot holes here are very annoying. I lost track of how many times I rolled my eyes at the dubious ""logic"" served up here. The acting was as good as it could be (I guess) but, at the end, they throw in a surprise guest star (who I won't name). It didn't help because I think he's a terrible actor and this didn't change my mind. I was bored and looked at my watch MANY times while this played. It's boring, obvious and manipulative. Why is this getting so much praise? Skip it."
107," Entertaining nonsense, but no masterpiece
","""Interstellar"" pretends to be more intelligent than Alfonso Cuarón's audio-visual roller coaster, ""Gravity"", but ironically its best moments are those which, like Gravity, rely purely on thrill and spectacle.For the rest of the film we are crammed into a tiny shuttle with McConaughey and his crew, or back on earth with the desperate remnants of human civilization as they attempt to solve the problem of starvation. Most of the dialogue consists of reams and reams of contrived quantum-physics babble, which, if you're like me, will whoosh straight over your head like those exposition sequences in CSI, with brief moments of levity provided by the two -weirdly cubic looking- robots TARS and CASE.Their journey to find another habitable planet is marred by a sequence of seemingly insurmountable problems that become progressively so ludicrous, it ends up impossible to take them seriously, albeit exciting to watch.We already have to stretch our disbelief past the opening premise that the world is dying because of crop blight, yet they've managed to build robots that have human intelligence and can adapt a variety of shapes to achieve a wide range of tasks. One wonders why humans at this level of technological advancement couldn't have found a solution to curbing this unexplained blight other than blasting off into a foreign galaxy to try and populate a mysterious planet neighboring a black hole.Glaring plot issues aside (and there are many), the film is at its best when in full space simulator mode and the audience is being catapulted into the roaring white light of a black hole, accompanied by Hans Zimmer's electrifying score (props to Zimmer for once NOT composing something that sounded exactly like Pirates of The Caribbean), making full use of the IMAX experience.Performances are fairly solid, in particular Jessica Chastain as the grown up Murph, and there is enough raw emotion on show to push some of the more logically questionable moments past your cynic meter and give a sense of weight and importance to what is happening, even if you can't quite understand it.Definitely worth watching on the big screen, but would I give it a 9/10? No way. This is a film that you will enjoy on face value, but once you leave the cinema you will start picking it to shreds. There are just too many inconsistencies, contrivances and blatant stupidity in the plot to call this a masterpiece, but I'd give it a solid 7 for blockbuster entertainment value."
108," Don't get sucked into this movie black hole!
","Feeling very disappointed given all the hype and rave reviews. What a bunch of utter pseudo-scientific crap! The so-called ""scientific advisors"" must live in a parallel universe with completely different laws of nature. The characters are as flat as two-dimensional entities. The only realistic holes are not wormholes nor black holes but the gaping holes in the storyline. How come Hollywood these days always seems to take fascinating science fiction-themes and mangle them into some commercial junk that is all about fiction and has not the slightest thing to do with science? Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is still light years ahead of the rest of the pack, almost 50 years since that brilliant film was created. Don't waste your money on this farce but buy a good book instead and create your own space-time adventure on your comfortable couch at home."
109," Don't waste three hours on this - It's totally boring!
","I must echo the sentiments of many of the other negative reviewers. The movie moved into emotional elements of the characters without developing the characters. I felt nothing for the characters, and I REALLY wanted to. There were a few moments when I was interested enough to see how the makers were going to present some of the physics based elements, but nobody/nothing got spaghetta-fied (Neil DeGrasse Tyson's description/term).It is really a love story disguised as a sci-fi fantasy. And not even a very good love story. I was so bored, I fell asleep for about 15 minutes. I felt like just getting up and leaving so many times but I thought maybe if I stayed it would get better. It didn't. I really hoped that the actors starring in the movie could make it better. They tried but it didn't help. Can I get my money back? How many millions of people could they have fed for the money they wasted making this movie? They could make it up to me if they donated the money they made from this movie to feed the poor in this country."
110," A 3 hour Science Lecture delivered by a Village Idiot
","Let me start by saying that I have enjoyed Christopher Nolan's work in the past; Memento, Insomnia, (parts of) The Batman Trilogy. I find him a very talented film-maker with strong ideas and visual sense. Therefore it makes me very sad to state that, categorically, this is an absolute turkey. In many places, the plot is so full of holes, that you can do little but laugh-out loud. There will be reviewers on here, talking about DEPTH, Intimations of Mortality etc etc. Forget it. This is just a total misfire. Actors used to say, despairingly, that they were playing Johnny Exposition - you know the guy who explains everything to the audience. Note I said Despairingly. This has almost every character explaining everything from wormholes to the Mystery of Love (oh yeah). After a totally boring, drawn-out beginning which seems to be there to prove that Nolan has watched The Grapes of Wrath many times over, we get the first huge laugh when we meet Sir Michael Caine, with a laughable Posh - Cockney - American accent. He is playing the part that Sam Shephard (in this) or Morgan Freeman (usually) play. He is not up to it; never was never will be. It takes a certain amount of skill to be able to deliver line after line of pseudo-scientific gobbledygook and make it sound real. Caine's performance - like so many of his performances - screams out ""Where's my bleedin' paycheck?"" When Coop (Gary Cooper - westerns - get it) agrees to fly this practically suicidal mission to the outer reaches of space, he blasts off like a Cosmic Cowboy, all bravado and charisma - at which point his fellow crew member shows him - with a pen and paper - what a wormhole is. Yes, when he is leading a flight into outer space, a little late doncha think? It gets worse, when poor Anne Hathaway, playing, as my son said - Science Girl, has to recite a monologue about Love and how it can cross all dimensions of space, time, blah blah blah. I really felt for her. I won't expand on the Plot, I couldn't if I wanted to. And the last 30 minutes have to be seen to be disbelieved. This is NOT one of those films that you see and forget immediately, you will wake up in a few months time, laughing at Michael Caine's last scene or his recital of Dylan Thomas' famous lines - not once but twice...and the End. Oh the end. McConaghey gives it his all, having to cry on more than one occasion - believe me, I know how he felt. Don't believe anyone if they tell you 'you didn't GET it'. That's like saying you didn't GET an episode of Two and a Half Men. Ambitious yes, but a turd is a turd - even if they meant to produce a new hybrid Rose."
111," Science Fiction Fan Hated this Movie
","This movie was so boring I literally had to leave the theater before I fell asleep sitting upright. I gave Interstellar a full hour to get more interesting, considering the rave reviews and ratings on this site that prompted me to see it. But I couldn't wait any longer.The film was scientifically implausible to such an extent that I could not suspend disbelief and enjoy the film at face value. The character development was weak, the protagonist was arrogant and unlikable and the acting talent of many great actors was utterly wasted on this bomb. The dialog was predictable, unimaginative and flat. While it did not affect the quality of the film, I was disappointed that the movie was based on the dangerous delusion that human beings might be able to find a new home in space, so people don't have to think too much about taking action on the very real climate change that is destroying planet Earth right now. But it was the series of stupid moments in the first hour that informed me Interstellar was not going to meet my standards for an intelligent film. The first stupid moment was during the life-threatening giant dust storm scene, complete with large chunks of flying debris. After the family jumps into the truck and races home for shelter, the driver inexplicably parks the truck about fifteen yards away from the front door so that they all have to run outside through the dust storm before reaching the house. Huh?Another stupid moment was when the protagonist is asked to pilot a gargantuan state-of-the-art space craft (apparently built by a few dozen people without any budget) less than an hour after he first surprises NASA with his first arrival. This pilot has not flown an aircraft for years and there is no way anyone, no matter how experienced he once was, could fully master the technology of this ship and be prepared for a complex space mission in the extremely short period of time that elapsed (evidenced by no change in the age of the pilot's children) between being asked to captain the ship and actually doing so. He almost instantly assumes full command of the ship and the crew and successfully takes the ship into deep outer space on a dangerous mission. This sequence of events had no credibility. It felt like some adolescent boy's fantasy come true.The last-straw final stupid moment was when I realized that the female astronaut played by Anne Hathaway is wearing fresh make-up everyday including false eyelashes. Not a big deal considering the major problems with this film, but it nevertheless annoyed me. What competent astronaut is going to waste time and energy applying false eyelashes in outer space during a serious space mission? How would several years worth of cosmetics (along with false eyelashes) even get approved as cargo given the severe space limitations of a spaceship? How are we supposed to find this astronaut credible?That's when I realized it really was time to abandon the film. I was getting downright irritable."
112," Tepid, at best
","Oh my...Another ""Science Fiction"" film made by those geniuses who never took a science class in life.Interstellar, is a boring slow, plodding condescending type of film that thinks is much more smart than it realty is.Cant't just people go and explore three planets without this melodramatic nonsense? Wouldn't it be much better if all this humanist approach was discarded in favor of a story based on the true adventure of traveling through a wormhole?If people want drama there are a huge number of other (much better) films. If I want to feel bad I will watch Schindler's list... If I want some good Science Fiction I will watch Aliens. Is it that hard for people to get it?This was supposed to be a science fiction adventure, for god's sake. Why do these genius have to butcher what could have been a great film with all this over-bloated sentimentalism, this sacchariny mess? This is yet another proof that the masses are brain dead. They laud anything that is over complicated, with mindless twists, with some sort of stupid revelation as the work of a genius.Interstellar is another extremely over rated film. It rivals Prometheus in stupidity!I'd rather shoot a nail through my foot than ever watching it again..."
113," Disappears up its own black hole.
","As directed by Christopher Nolan, he of the pretentious, derivative, mind-bending crap-fest that was Inception and the vastly over-rated Dark Knight trilogy, I fully expected Interstellar to have plot holes you could pilot a space station through—and, with a whopping running time of 169 minutes, I figured staying awake would be a task almost as gargantuan as the film's black hole (which is actually called Gargantua—that's just how gargantuan it is!!!).Sure enough, the preposterous pseudo-scientific plot can be picked apart with ease, but the film itself is something of an anomaly: although it is a grossly indulgent pile of pretentious hooey that stretches plausibility to breaking point, I found myself entertained throughout. Interstellar is so far up itself that it actually transcends all the laws of cinema and proves to be a rather enjoyable piece of big-budget baloney as a result.For starters, we get Matthew McConaughey's farmer Cooper, who is chosen to pilot NASA's only spacecraft, despite having spent the last decade or so growing corn. Then we get two of science-fiction's most aesthetically awkward robots in the form of A.I. units TARS and CASE. After flying through a worm-hole, Cooper lands his spacecraft in several inches of water and then surfs a massive tidal wave. We see a planet so cold that its clouds are solid ice. We have a mad scientist who rants about the human instinct for survival while head butting Cooper with his space helmet. Although Michael Caine's character spans 23 years, he doesn't look a day older than when we first see him (his voice just gets a bit hoarse, but not Batman hoarse). And Cooper enters a black hole where he ends up behind a 5-dimensional bookcase that allows him to manipulate gravity to send a message to his daughter via wristwatch!!!And that's just the stuff I can recall right now (it's waaay past my bed-time and I'm very tired).If only there had been a few ninjas, some gratuitous female nudity (perhaps a race of insatiable, sexy alien maidens with over-sized breasts), a planet of space zombies, and a laser battle, this would have been the perfect so-bad-it's-good movie.7/10: it's too wonderfully silly for me too hate on it as much as I really should."
114," Unwatchable, give me the three hours back
","This is a formal request to Matt Damon, Matthew Mccougnehey, Christopher Nolan and the rest of the people behind this movie to give me three hours of my life back.I warn anyone that is considering to watch this movie, Don't. This movie is riddled with plot holes, a storyline that is so formulaic and predictable that it borders on something a 5th grader could have wrote. If you watch the first 20 minutes of the movie, the rest of the movie you will just be waiting for the stuff that you know will happen to happen. There is little room for surprise, and even less room for enjoyment.Adding to this, the visuals in the movie are a huge problem, in watching it I got a headache and motion sickness. So not only was I left with a feeling of wasted time after leaving the cinema, I also felt physically ill. I feel the actors in this movie are all outside their comfort zones, and the acting feels very forced, and it feels like not even the actors in the movie want to be a part of it. I would recommend this movie to anyone that enjoyed ""The Room"" with Tommy Wiseau, or Gigli with Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez. Because I think we have a new winner in the unwatchable movie hall of fame: Interstellar."
115," I really WANTED to like this movie
","OK, my first IMDb review. I REALLY wanted to like this movie. I love Nolan's work and I'm a science fiction fan. Sadly within an hour I was wondering if I could stick out another two hours. The actors are all great, and they get the few stars I'm willing to give it. I will admit that directing a big production like this is not for the faint-hearted and I'll give Nolan points for that. However, the story is so poorly constructed it just piles on frustration after frustration. Other reviewers on here have described the litany of illogical errors. I haven't read all 900 reviews but we have long known that black holes EAT stars and planets, and when they do, they give off titanic bursts of gamma and x-ray radiation that would sterilize entire regions of a galaxy. I'm willing to suspend my disbelief in service of just enjoying a movie, but when the entire premise is to find a more suitable home for human life and then you choose a planet apparently orbiting a black hole, well that just goes from suspension to just outright disbelief. If Batman had chosen to just use his magic freeze gun to stop the nuke in Gotham I think most Batman fans would have been groaning. That's the way someone like me feels about lazy plot devices like this. There is also WAY too much unnecessary dialogue in this movie, the superb cast are wasted saying clichéd and hackneyed lines. The whole punchline of the ""ghost"" you could see coming in the first hour, so you just ended up wondering how they would get there over the next 109 minutes. I'm sorry but I thought the music was intensely annoying and was just designed to jar you awake every half an hour. Then there is the whole ""Don't open the airlock! Don't open the airlock!"" I was sitting there thinking ""Just open the damn airlock and get it over with."" Everything was either entirely predictable or completely illogical. Floating frozen clouds? Seriously? The least they could do was have Tinkerbell fly onto the set and explain how that could happen. I guess because Cameron got away with nicking Roger Dean's floating mountains in Avatar, Nolan thought no one would complain. But let's face it Avatar wasn't exactly trying to be clever and that's where this goes over the line. If you're going to delve into the BIG questions like Quantum Mechanics, Relativity and black holes you set yourself up to be measured by a whole new set of rules. Nobody complains about Harry Potter flying on a broomstick but have him try and explain it using Einstein and you're going to be in a mess of trouble.As for the reviews comparing it to 2001, the only things it has that are the same is that it is set in space and there is a wormhole. Absolutely nothing else is the same and frankly it is an insult to compare this to Kubrick's masterpiece. And when people say, ""get over it, it's just a movie"" they're rewarding someone for being lazy. Just like Gravity this had all the elements to be a masterpiece if they'd just bothered to talk to a few more people in the science community besides Kip Thorne; who apparently understands the workings of the universe all except for the black hole which is Hollywood."
116," Rubbish
","I found this pretentious crap. After some 80 years of being addicted to movies and being a fan of Science Fiction from the days of Astounding and Galaxy, very few films have lived up to expectations. ""2001"""" the best of the lot. The mix of sugared family relations and hand-on-the wheels spaceship driving like a racing car plus some probably very expensive gadgetry was too boring for me, sorry, I did not last the fulll length and had to find my own wormhole like fast forward to the finish."
117," Multi-dimensional mess

The Nolan brothers, however, get zilch for their bullshit cosmology mixed with banal sentimentality and quasi-philosophy. It is a mystery to me, why some filmmakers love to mix so much ""science"" into their movies, when most of it is so horrendously unrealistic, misleading, incomprehensible and incorrect. Kubrick avoided most of the science talk, and created an artistic expression of the space-and-time mystery. That's why ""2001"" will remain a masterpiece and why ""Interstellar"" will be soon forgotten. And the movie is also painfully slow, 168 mins, most of which are spent on closeups of McConaugh and Hathaway, with or without space helmet as well as worn and rusty space equipment, as if that would make it look more real..."
118," Take away the visuals and the soundtrack and the feelings of grandeur - and you get utter nonsense
","DISCLAIMER: I'm in general, a huge Nolan fan.There are times when you can ignore plot holes in films, and times when you can't. You can overlook some when the pacing is fast, or when the film doesn't take itself too seriously. Unfortunately, Interstellar does neither - it's unnecessarily slow and takes itself really, really seriously. And it's full of plot holes, fallacies, paradoxes, and logic taking a beating in general, to fulfill some emotional quotient - which, I must say, worked on most people.Let's start with the whole premise the film is based on - in the future, earth's resources have been drained, and everyone has turned into farmers - with conscious efforts to eradicate science education in general to force people to go into farming. Let's take a moment here to realize just how ridiculous that premise is.Moving on - our protagonist is a genius NASA astronaut/engineer turned farmer (because, y'know, everyone's a farmer) - and the first half mostly shows him bonding with his family, with completely unnecessary scenes to prolong the film - like taking down a lost drone (by pointing things towards it), which had no relation to the story later whatsoever. Then our hero stumbles onto a NASA facility (if you aren't a farmer, you're with NASA) after decoding things which occurred due to... uhh, gravitational anomalies. This NASA facility, as claimed by uberscientist Michael Caine, was humanity's best kept secret, though 5 minutes into that - all our hero's family members were informed about it. So anyways, since our hero stumbled into the facility anyway, uberscientist decides to send him into space to save humanity because, well, just like that. We get to see our hero saying goodbye to his family and immediate fast forward - he's in space! No training, no nothing! Economic storytelling, certainly, and it would've worked, had the other ""scientists"" on board later didn't have to explain things and plans to him on the fly (which, for all intents and purposes, should've been explained before leaving) - and having conversations that were mostly like what college freshmen studying physics would have. (Oh, and discussions about love! Love transcending all dimensions - when humanity is at stake!)Anyway, so future earth has the technology to do all this, and build robot A.I.s which were more human than most humans, but it doesn't have doctors any more, or any other visible technological advancements for that matter. All efforts to save humanity were concentrated on ONE and just ONE uberscientist, who'd been working on his cure-all formula for years. And every other scientist have just been waiting for him to solve it all himself! (And what's this? Other nations you ask? Well there ain't no other nation apart from the USA to do earth saving, is there?) This is something I particularly take offense to, scientists don't work that way.So, Nolan throws more science at us on the fly, which everyone dodges. But in the end, everything is explained by, yep, five dimensional space! Somehow our hero gets into such a space, goes back in time (opening up a ton of paradoxes), behind a bookshelf in 5D space, and uses vague messages to communicate with his daughter back in time, instead of giving clear messages like ""I'm your father back in time"". His daughter, when all grown up - suddenly realizes that it was his father all along and we get no clue as to how she got to that conclusion - but hey, PLOT TWIST! And with that new information, she becomes the new uberscientist, saving everyone. How? By making an orbiting space station around Saturn (for which you somehow required ""quantum data"" from other galaxies and black holes?). So okay uhh... it's complicated.There are however, some great visuals (3D would've done justice) and soundtrack in this, and hence the 5 - but ultimately nothing we haven't seen before. Beyond all that glitter, there's no gold - just a forgettable movie."
119," What a disappointment!
","I waited with great anticipation for this movie and was sorely and truly disappointed. I don't understand where the 10 reviews came from? What planet were they on! Perhaps they were from viewers from the other side of the worm hole or black hole! I have been a sci fi fan for many years but this movie took a leave from all logical or good sci fi explanations. Plot was ambiguous. Storyline convoluted. Technology was not linear. One sees a 20th century Saturn V lifting the crew up to a 22nd century space craft. Sleep pods with crew jumping into them like they are going for a nap! Exploratory craft that operate like a Star War's movie. Landing on a water world with some silly time dilation theme that doesn't affect craft in orbit? Can't these people survey the world from orbit? Black holes, 5 dimensions with metaphysical connection! Shameless referrals to 2001. It was embarrassing. On and on for way too long. Han Zimmer's music score was good with a few good special effects. But that was it."
120," Nolan's worst movie by far
","I was excited for this movie. I liked pretty much all of Nolan's previous movies and I love sci-fi. Judging from the reviews, I was expecting something similar to the quality and entertainment of Inception. What I got was probably one of the most boring movies I've seen on cinema.The movie is unnecessary long, the dialogs are predictable and make you laugh, and the subject of the movie (which btw is not interstellar traveling) has been done several time before (awfully usually). We get it. Family is important, love is valuable. This is not a sci-fi movie, this is his is a family movie about a father's love for his children.I will not go into details to avoid spoilers, but there were about 10 minutes after the first slow hour that got me excited for the rest of the movie, but it was only a break and we were back to boredom and more crying by McConaughey. I found the acting pretty bad, which I guess is a result of the awful script, since I liked McConaughey's acting on Dallas Buyers Club (and partially on true detective)."
121," As Spock would say, this movie is illogical.
","Listen ""I'm not a smart man"", but I have basic reasoning skills and common sense. Now whilst I understand that sci-fiction doesn't follow the rules of reality (suspension of disbelief and all), there still has to be coherency, rules, and order however fantastical within the made up world so that people buy into the movie. This movie lacks those attributes in spades and is a bitch slap to the viewer's intelligence.In one snippet of the three hour non-sense you'll endure and I do mean endure, the intrepid saviors of the world decide to check out a water planet because their predecessor sent a beacon that this was a viable planet for new earth, but within minutes of their landing on two inches of water they realize that a giant wave had smashed their scout to bits promptly after she landed years before and they were about to suffer the same fate... but oh happy day they manage to escape wasting only a few hours of their time (but decades of earth time). Well that sucks but it makes sense that they had to check it out right? Not when you realize they could have avoided the watery planet from hell if the first scout hadn't sent out a beacon saying the planet was viable in the first place, after all how could she know that in the mere MINUTES between when she landed and was then smashed to bits?!?! Nice to know that when the fate of mankind is in the balance a responsible scientist would jump to such a rushed conclusion, ""hey guys, I just landed here, looks great, come now xoxo."" Then you have another scientist on another planet who was supposedly selflessly brave enough to go on a one-way trip to scout a planet, then chicken shi!s out when he gets there and realizes it's not viable and he's a dead man so selfishly dooms mankind's one chance by having them waste their limited resources to get there just to unwittingly rescue him, but then decides he can still save mankind by killing his rescuers so that he can complete the mission all by himself, holy whiplash with his conflicting moralities/immoralities Batman.I could go on and on but I won't. I conclude by saying it really irks me when a movie like this gets lauded as a masterpiece when it's really just acid tripping rubbish."
122," I'm still recovering
","My wife and I love Sci-fi and have been anticipating this movie for months! When we saw the 9.3 review (that's what it is now anyway) we were even more excited. So, off we went to the theater last night ready to be blown away.We almost left the movie, which would be a first.OK, the special effects are great, but the sniveling factor we couldn't stomach. I'm mean seriously, there was someone bawling on the screen nearly 50% of the movie. Many of the lines were so cheesy we look at each other like, ""can you believe this?"" If you like sad drama's, depressing story lines and crying astronauts give it a go. This falls under SciFi, but it really should fall under drama. Ugh, I'm trying to forget it."
123," Don't expect too much
","Just watched this in New Zealand. The IMDb rating is still above 9 at the time. Not sure it will stay there though. It's not a bad movie but it's not a great one either (which a 9 should be). It's creative in terms of story but it is drawn out. It goes for the Gravity look and feel, being slow, filmed in space and with dialog often replaced with music, but it does not have the suspense of Gravity. It's doesn't draw you in. It just doesn't have enough substance to carry it off. It has plenty of promise but lets you down in the end, especially once you pull all the pieces together to formulate what's going on. It's still worth watching, at 7/10, just don't expect a 9/10."
124," Mostly Bad...I don't Understand the Hype
","OK, I am far from a critic.I generally have an open mind about films. I watch a lot of them. I don't even take the time to review many. But I just don't understand how everyone thinks this is a good film. First, let me point out the good things. The soundtrack was amazing. Maybe it didn't work with every scene but it was nice to listen to. The production value was almost flawless. The space scenes were very believable. The acting was generally good. I like most of the actors in general. BUT....the story..plot....I am not going to get into too many details. It just didn't work. You are fed so many physics/science concepts with no explanations. It's like taking one sentence from every science article on the net from the past 20 years and saying ""just believe what I am telling you"", even though it's impossible to understand from such simple dialog. Then you are expected to believe......well MANY ridiculous things that somehow just happen. I'll leave it at that. I am going to bed."
125," Ghost Protocol
","There are moments during ""Interstellar"" which may be compared to ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" (a better movie). There are moments during ""Interstellar"" which may be compared to ""Prometheus"" (also, a better movie). There are even moments and storytelling techniques within ""Interstellar"" that are completely ripped off from ""Inception"" (a much better movie, from Christopher Nolan himself). That said, ""Interstellar"" should still be touted as the most ambitious film of the year so far, and in the same breath, should ultimately go down as one of director Christopher Nolan's worst films to date.This highly anticipated Nolan project depicts a future riddled with dust storms, where the world's food supply is nearly depleted (or at least 40 to 60 years out from being depleted, but that doesn't sound nearly as dire) where astronauts are working as farmers and children are taught that the Apollo space missions were faked. During this time, an underground government institution called NASA commissions a group of astronauts (including Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway) for a top secret space mission. This mission will have them traveling through a newly discovered wormhole, with the promise of finding another inhabitable world.OK, let's get right to it. Any praise I heap upon this movie will be directed at the final 90 minutes of this two hour and 49 minute long film, since the first 80 or so minutes of ""Interstellar"" (while absolutely gorgeous at times to behold) is drenched in sequences of McConaughey seemingly reenacting moments from those pretentious Lincoln car ads, caught in a continuous and almost finger wagging diatribe about how the human race was never meant to die on earth, which nearly put me to sleep. In other words, the first half of this is as slow and lifeless as watching a dead astronaut drift through space. Anyway, this is Intersellar's fatal flaw, since the latter half is ripe with big budget yet very symbolic action sequences, stunning cinematography and fascinating talking points dealing with the nature of human survival in the face of an unsympathetic universe, due to some really insightful slabs of dialogue from a script written by Nolan and his brother, Jonathan. Even the literal rocket science lingo becomes more and more palatable as the ""gravity"" of this plot begins to set in, near the midpoint of Act 2.Final Thought/The Ending: Allow me to take a quick spoiler free moment to discuss this ending. During the final act of ""Interstellar"", for most film nerds, Nolan's story will be encroaching on the hallowed grounds of Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". Some will admire the sheer ballsyness of what he does in this pivotal moment and others will find it in bad taste. Though this is not a huge issue, since I don't believe this niche group will have much effect on ticket sales, the problem is that for the millions who didn't see ""Interstellar"" for any film school aesthetic reason, Nolan's ending will simply come off as so strange and obnoxiously far-fetched, that many may leave the theater angry that the punch-line wasn't worth the nearly three hour set up."
126," An underwhelming experience for me
","Overall, ""Interstellar"" was an underwhelming experience for me.The film spent too much time establishing characters and relationships that in the end just felt unconvincing and contrived.It was full of wooden dialogue. The parts in which the scientists dropped basic astrophysical knowledge in a Wikipedia-like diction were cringeworthy.The conclusions to which they jumped (aliens put the wormhole there to save the human race, love has to be the fifth dimension) rendered these characters completely unbelievable to me.The turn of events by which Cooper came to be the chosen pilot of the spacecraft, that was probably the most painfully impotent writing I have ever seen in a large budget movie.The film completely failed to show the space pioneers having any sense of awe in light of the incredible things they were witnessing. When Cooper was told about the existence of a wormhole near Saturn and the habitable planets on the other side, he took it like a boring lecture and the most obvious thing ever. This grotesquely ignorant attitude was visible throughout the whole movie. Characters only ever showed care and concern for their own families or abstract concepts like ""the human race"". I found this totally anthropocentric perspective not credible at all and highly unlikeable.However, when the spacecraft passed Saturn, it was beautiful to look at. The spheric wormhole was simply breathtaking. Although the scene was way too short, it was one of the best.The black hole and its center was also quite good.Visually, the film lacked imagination and scope in every other aspect. Most of the space scenes consisted of unexciting chamber shots inside the spacecraft. The beauty and wonder of the foreign planets wasn't explored at all. Besides a very cool tidal wave, the most exciting thing happening there was a stupid brawl between two astronauts on a rocky surface.There was also a risky docking maneuver in space that was thrilling, but depressing nonetheless. When a standard action beat such as a docking maneuver is the most exciting scene in a film about intergalactic space travel, you know the scriptwriter did something wrong.The scene where Cooper meets his daughter as an old woman was very touching and well executed. It reminded me of one of my favorite Twilight Zone episodes, ""The Long Morrow"".In my opinion, the film suffered from a weak screenplay and little imagination."
127," Ugh... (looks down at watch for the eleventh time)
","Well, it is interesting for sure to see reviews for this film at the extreme ends, either loving or hating. I like to watch movies but I am not like some who seem to be students of film. I didn't know going in that Interstellar would be nearly three hours or that Nolan had directed the film. I hated Inception. Also, I have a bit of a problem when people always bring up the Science in a Science Fiction film. it is in fact FICTION. However, Interstellar was just dreadful. the first hour they were on a farm in the middle of who knows where. Nothing was established. How long had it been since Cooper had flown. What was his involvement in his previous career? How did the world get to like it was portrayed in this movie? Also, I had a problem with the premise that Mankind was never meant to stay on earth. What? Then Cooper is asked to fly a mission and doesn't even have time to reacquaint with current technology but he can dock a ship while spinning at over 50 miles an hour. Hmmm. Like others said, there is no character development so you don't care about these people. The dialog also had a lot of problems. I was angry when I walked out. I couldn't leave early because I was with someone. Ugh, what a waste of time and money!"
128," painful and stupid
","First, about the pain, which is mostly due to the sound. I don't know how many times we're in a rocket ship blasting off somewhere with everything shaking, the cameras jiggling, the astronauts grimacing, and the sound track roaring, screeching, thundering, blasting the eardrums—I really did have to plug my ears by the end of the movie. Add to that the so- called music, which consisted mostly of even higher mountains of noise, mostly produced by a big pipe organ pumping out its gargantuan decibels in the form of a few simple chords—hardly music, merely a musical instrument adding to the overall accumulation of noise. I don't think anybody should be credited with creating ""music"" for this film.As for the stupidity, I was lured into the theatre by publicity claiming that the film had got the science right, or at least the graphic representation of a wormhole and black hole. Well, the graphics may have been right, but they were pretty standard stuff as far as eye candy goes, hardly worth the price of the ticket. What about the science? Maybe it was correct on every point, or on most points, or only on a few points—who knows? Only someone with degrees in quantum mechanics and astrophysics would be able to judge. For the general audience (obviously, the audience the film was aimed at), the science talk came across as sheer gobbledygook. There was no effort to explain the ideas for the public. The jargon was just spat out here and there with the purpose of raising a smokescreen for the current plot point. Very annoying.I wanted to enjoy this film. I hated not liking it, knowing how much money and effort went into making it. But by the time we got to the last 20 minutes or so, I'd had enough and had to fight the urge to walk out. In fact, I did get out of my seat and watched the last 10 minutes or so from the back of the auditorium near the exit door."
129," The best example of a really good advertisement movie in years
","This movie is not a 1 in reality, it's more a 5-6, but i need to make that stupid average rating go down.I couldn't understand why this movie has a 9.0 in IMDb. But now reading the comments here I finally get it, it's good advertisement, the best advertisement that I have seen in many years.This movie will drive you crazy if you know something about astrophysics (or normal physic) and you have seen enough movies in your life. Because there are way too many clichés and too many pseudo-physics, not fake physics like the Disney's films, pseudo-physics like 'ancient aliens' from ""History"" Channel.PS: Sorry for my English."
130," Overrated
","I won't give it a 1 to even things up a little, I give it a 6 which is real. Maybe 6.5 but 7 would be a stretch. I'm disappointed with a film that I waited for so long, with a great title that was waisted. Interstellar should have been a masterpiece, with, well, a lot of Interstellar traveling. The duration is just to long, especially the first part, which brings nothing extra to the story. It's just to stretched out trying to bring I don't know what. A feel of 2001 maybe, but 2001 is in another galaxy for this one. I didn't like Inception either, so maybe it has got to be something with Nolan. I'm a sci-fi fan, but today everyone's trying to make sci-fi, but they don't succeed. They are doing it wrong! District 9 was the last good sci-fi I watched. Interstellar has got great visuals, I give it that, but Gravity had more (another film that sucked big time). I wouldn't watch it again."
131," Left me speechless
","Everything about it was brilliant;

132," Best movie of all time. An experience at the movie theater.
",Surreal experience when I watched it at the movie theater. #neverforget
133," Not So Stellar
","It's a pretty good movie. You'll be immersed in the visuals, the graphics, some mystery, and a review on quantum physics in space, and you will enjoy the mysteries contained in it. However, the acting and casting are almost embarrassing at times and poor. The narrative and script suffers greatly from a lack of focus and pointless plot tricks. There's a sequence toward the end that while engaging, is some of the most over the top dramatic, just-for-effects senseless filmmaking you will ever see. It worked in Inception, but not in Interstellar. Overall, it is a ""pretty good"" film, but it falls short in so many categories. The visuals are worth the ride, and the best part is the presentation of the new planets. If only they would have spent more time on the water planet (that was the best part of the movie), but then if they did, every hour was worth 7 years on earth, so the story had to go elsewhere. The other graphics were good too. But there are some senseless plot turns that will frustrate you and it will lose points immediately from its' current 8.7 rating. For example, was Matt Damon's space crazy Dr. Mann even necessary? The answer when you think about it is no. It had no point in the overall story except to add more drama and intensity to an audience who already had plenty to begin with. What a waste of top level talent."
134," Decent Visuals but very lazy story telling...
","Firstly, I quite like the movie in terms of visuals and the sound track. About 10 minutes in though, I find myself wishing for sub-titles as the actors' voices are inaudible. (I like MM but where is Clooney when we need him?) Now, the story idea is not half bad except Nolan misunderstood the meaning of Sci-Fi...the fiction part of 'Science Fiction' refers to the science portion of a narrative, not the human story. Leaps of faith can be justified with stretching science, especially in areas not fully understood/known by people. The human part of the story has to be true for the audience to relate to (unless there is a setting in the story for human evolution that makes them different to what we are now.) Too many illogical human behaviours are just strung together to move this along and I believe Nolan hoped that the great visuals will distract us from thinking about what is going on. I will highlight a few that ruined the movie for me, even though plenty more were present. Watch out...spoilers below!1)Murph had experienced the 'ghost' from a young age yet didn't know who it might be; yet, when we find out that the 'ghost' is Cooper, she suddenly comes to the same realisation?!? That is of course essential to the story or otherwise she will not take what he transmits seriously, yet there is no reason for her to link the 'ghost' to her father. He could have easily added a message of 'This is your dad' to her, but he never did; and even if he had, it wouldn't work with the younger Murph...if he had located the older Murph (when she was retrieving her stuff), then maybe it will make more sense...very lazy story telling here as it could have been easy to add (maybe 20 seconds of screen time?). This one thing is key to the later part of the movie and without it; the movie couldn't go along the lines it did.2)Assuming we accept that Tor and Cooper did work out the mystery of the black hole that relates to their calculation and he transmitted all the data through her watch. Even if she did figure out that it's a message from her dad (or from someone important), she wasn't paying attention to the message. It is like tuning in to a radio talk show (on serious maths no less) mid-way through a program, there is no way for her to decipher the full message if she missed the first large chunk of what was sent.3)He knew that the message 'Stay' wouldn't work to keep him on the ground. Shouldn't he try a different message? Of course, that would change history and likely Nolan didn't want to go near this paradox...but this is Sci-Fi and I'd welcome the debate that would bring...instead, he rehashes the same old, knowing it wouldn't work.4)Young Murph was understandably upset with her dad when he left...but she becomes part of mission control? Hang on...she has firsthand knowledge of what her father is up to... she knows about plan A, Plan B and the importance of the mission...yet, she wouldn't send him a message? If she became someone outside the scientific field, I can at least accept her continued anger, but putting her in mission control makes it unacceptable. (She should at least be so upset that she wants no part of a mission control which sent her dad away. Otherwise, she should understand why he had to go. ) 5) Murph has a space station named after her so she has some cloud on 'her' space station. When she suggested that Coop goes to Brand, she could help with getting him a spacecraft. Instead, he had to steal one...really? Security is not a concern in the future? A guy who has been out of the loop for almost a century just walks into and starts up a craft, knows all the correct codes to open air locks and even the way out?? (Maybe unlike now, aerospace technology does not improve in a century?) The above really killed the movie for me.Sidenotes:A) If according to their plan, skimming just outside the gravity field to go into the water planet quickly, they surely didn't spend 3+ hours there. How did it translate to 23 years? (Well, I spent almost 3 hours watching this nonsense, so maybe it is possible. Not in the way it was shown though.) B) If all of Cooper's electronics failed on entering the black hole, how did TOR survive? TOR is fully electronics! Poor story telling as this could be explained under sci-fi rules yet wasn't done.C) Why would Murph travel 2 years to the space station, with all her family in tow, to visit her father...yet on seeing him, sends him away?D) Dr Mann and Cooper walked to the edge of the cliff...yet Brand takes a few minutes on a spacecraft to reach there? She took so long that Dr Mann had the time to WALK back to the station to board the other spacecraft, before they FLY back. Ridiculous! (Nolan, this is not a commercial flight... flying cannot be so much slower than walking by any stretch of the imagination.) Overall, without a logical human story, Interstellar is just a decent visual and sound show...its almost 3 hours play time is too long when audience is not absorbed into the tale.I gave it a 5 because I did enjoy some part of the movie (the effects and sound), otherwise, it would get a 3.5 out of 10. Almost 3 hours in a cinema is way too much for this lazily told story. (Plus, there's a chance you'll age 23 years.) I sure wouldn't watch it again."
135," Could do better (*Spoiler alert*)
","(Spoiler Alert!)I can't believe that there are so many glowing reviews of this movie. On the plus side: brilliant CG, FX, cinematography. On the negative side: the awful acting, the terrible plot, the script, the hokey comic book physics explained for the lowest common denominator in the audience.I really liked McConaughey in Dallas Buyer's Club - by far the best thing he's done to date. But in this movie? Just another fly-by-the- seat-of-the-pants astronaut, risking everything and everyone, but it all works out in the end. Of course.Way too much time at the start of the movie setting up the ending, which came as no surprise whatsoever, thanks to the 'ghost'. And then we discover that 'love conquers all'. Including science. Of course.Probably most of the reason I rated this so low is because with a name like 'Interstellar' I was expecting way too much depth on the intricacies of theoretical interstellar travel, the time relativity concept, et al. Sigh.And the smart-ass, wisecracking robot was the last straw.Just. So. Bad."
136," A sad blockbuster attempt at cinema
","You know those special movies that leave you with something more than you had before you watched them? They enrich you, teach you, show you. This isn't one of those. Interstellar is the pathetic result of a lot of bad ideas slamming together in Nolan's mind, falling out as broken disjointed garbled mush in the script.The script isn't the only problem with all of it's hammy hokum and lack of character. Even the heralded special effects are so cliché at this point that they hardly add anything to this abyssal cavity of broken ideas. Here is what happened. Nolan saw some discovery channel show, or perhaps PBS, about the cosmos. He said to himself, ""I could make an adventure movie about that."" Unfortunately for those of us who recognize good cinema from average and just slop, he couldn't.I watch zero budget movies with more thoughtfulness than this two hundred million dollar nightmare. Trade me all of the special effects in the world for one moment of realistic human emotion.As cynical as it sounds, after seeing the 9 of 10 rating for this garbage, I question whether or not humanity would even deserve to be saved from the cataclysm."
137," The most overrated movie ever
","It is not easy to specify the general flaw in this movie, but I will try: the script was simply plotted without any technique applied that belongs to artistry. It is all flat, direct, linear, even though it is a fantasy and even though it speaks about time dilatation, wormholes, other galaxies and so on. When decades pass, there are trillion ways of displaying it. In this movie, there is only one - narration, and only after you understand what narration says a few emotionless flashbacks.Emotional background is missing. There is more emotional canvas painted in any Star Trek episode than this movie. It is so bad that there is nothing to act against.I truly think that the director read the script, took a CGI department to present what the script is talking about, and even this is done fairly unconvincing, and... he expected that to be that - a movie. There is zero effort in combining elements with more depth. The movie is still watchable, but there are far more nuances in some episodes of Twilight Zone. In this one, these are nuisances. It just looks the same, but it is a complete 169 minutes long spelling error.What is extremely surprising is critique that finds this movie far above average, some say a masterpiece, the users on IMDb are placing it among top 50 movies ever. It is not among first 1000, let alone 50.I hope nobody is going to claim that the movies like this one are above average or I will stop visiting theaters for good.I give this movie 2, for the sake of sanity, for the sake of art that movie once was. I hope time will speak against the quality of this movie soon enough."

","Matthew M mumbles and mumbles. No idea what he's on about. MM is miscast. We need someone who is audible and attractive. It's dusty but the dust doesn't settle on the corn. (No dust cloud follows the pick-up as they plough through the cornfield, chasing a drone.)This is a totally unexplained encounter. The family are so busy watching the drone that they nearly drive over a cliff even though they are on their own land. Perhaps because they are driving the pickup blind, yet fast enough to keep up with a jet-powered drone. Hello???No intelligible explanation for how MM landed the drone, what he found in it, how a groovy pile of dust helped him find the space station nor why they hired him to fly the mission. Why should Michael Caine be the NASA project director - he is hardly an obvious rocket scientist! Why such a bizarre robot? And did it wake them all up before the worm hole - or did I miss how that was to happen in the mumbles.Lo and behold - despite having travelled for months to the wormhole end near Saturn, they find themselves right beside a suitable planet at the other end. But I guess that was the work of ""them"".It is key to the plot, but there is no scientific concept that would make 1 hour on a planet into 7 years. And how come the open sea is paddle-able and a vast tsunami appears? Despite the size of the waves all is immediately calm and they seem to be predictable stuck.Some equally improbable idea was going to solve this problem but I'd lost interest. It is the moment I walked out. The movie to that point was uninteresting, and wholly illogical. I really thought with all the hype, it would be compelling, Instead it was plain irritating.Anne Hathaway was okay. At least we could hear what she was saying! And we could hear everyone else for that matter. Poor miscast good ol' boy Matthew.I have now read the Wikipedia synopsis, which is likewise unintelligible, and am hugely glad that I left - even though I have wasted one hour of the two hours I saved by writing this review!"
139," Proof that Nolan is detached from his characters.
","Interstellar, while visually stunning, is one of the most flawed films in recent memory. Flawed, because more time was spent rendering out the special effects than developing a screenplay worthy of the cast and budget. When you're a filmmaker who can make anything you want - on film - there is no excuse for your films to at-least bring something new to the table and work at a basic screenplay level.Interstellar does not ask new questions and with a script that literally feels like a first draft --I'm just shocked that Nolan didn't develop this more. The entire core of this film is the relationship between our lead Cooper and his daughter - but this is so rushed and honestly, extremely cheesy, that we don't care what happens. They spend far too much in time in space - with a ridiculous plot involving Matt Damon - and cut back to Earth is sporadic cuts that pull us into so many directions.This film proves that the Nolan brothers can not handle a couple of things: writing females and writing emotional characters that we're attached to. The dialogue was laughable - over the top in many places - and basically just a ton of one-liners. We cut from Cooper learning he has to go to space - says goodbye - boom on the rocket - NO ATTACHMENT. There is zero development here - just get him to space, which fails to tell the core story well - which bites this movie in its ass in the third act. Forced. Rushed. However you want to put it - I'm sorry folks - it's not a great movie - not even a good one. Everything is spoon fed to the audience - no, not just the science - the twists - I didn't know on the nose screen writing was so acceptable in Hollywood - guess it is. They talk about ghosts so many times within the first act that anyone with half a brain KNEW there was something there - and if you know anything about space travel, black holes - or any of the stuff that is talked about in the trailers - can put two and two together and call the major twist in the FIRST ACT. Come on Nolan, you can do better."
140," Every hour of that movie feels like seven years on earth
","OK, as a start I'm not a scientist, I don't know much about astrophysics or physics in general, so you can imagine if someone like me is disturbed by the scientific level of this movie, it might mean something. I don't know whether the farmers' association of Iowa sponsored the movie, but the starting point is that due to some mysterious circumstances, sand storms and droughts plague humanity. And of all possible crops, corn, one of the least drought resistant crops, is the one to survive? This is laughable. Also, the nitrogen level in the air increases mysteriously, although we never learn why and what might cause it. The only hint we get is that our appetite for electronic gadgets might have caused this situation. OK, right! Strange enough there is nothing scientists can do about it, or they all have given up hope and now believe in Ronald Reagan playing Neil Armstrong in 'Moonlanding II'. Except for a top-secret NASA project that seeks to find a new world humanity can destroy, and that can make space rockets start unnoticed by anybody in the middle of the US. This group is apparently so short on personnel that they immediately recruit a guy, who just accidentally stumbles into their headquarter, as an astronaut. The mere fact that he once used to be a pilot out matters all missing training that astronauts usually go through before going into space. Although the crew starts out on a pretty standard 20th century space rocket, they magically transfer into a hyper-modern long distance space ship, that somehow hangs around unmanned in earth's orbit. The newly recruited pilot - having worked as a farmer for years - neatly fits into the hyper-modern apparatus without the need of any training or upgrading - some people are just gifted and act on pure instinct. We are then explained the concept of a wormhole with a piece of paper, before we, after some turmoil - caused by primitive human sentiments, such as love and aggression -, somehow end up in a black hole. At this point, my patience was drawing thin and I only occasionally took a glimpse at the film. The hero-pilot/instinct-astronaut can enter the black hole unprotected and even get out of it unharmed. Inside the black hole - which strangely enough is not black at all, but resembles a kaleidoscope on LSD - he quickly solves the formula for gravity with the help of a fellow astronaut- who happened to be dead, before he reemerges as a friend of some mysterious 5-dimensional creatures (who, by the way, remain completely mysterious all over the film). The hero- pilot/instinct-astronaut then transmits the gravity formula to his daughter on earth via Morse code (heaven forbid, if you think how long it takes just to Morse S O S, then imagine to Morse the expression ""Double integral from minus infinity to one hundred""). The genius daughter of the hero-astronaut immediately decodes the information by throwing paper sheets around and saves humanity by creating a 5 dimensional room in space (that looks pretty three dimensional) as a copy of the earth, except that there is grass on the sky (to give us an idea of the 5th dimension) ... well, if you have lost track by now don't worry, watching the movie will leave you equally puzzled. By NOT watching it, you'll save yourself the extended boring scenes of rocket wings that inflate this unedited masterpiece to nearly 3! hours, the emotional drama, and Anne Hathaway's monologue about Love, the misunderstood force that breaks all boundaries and overcomes all spaces, cringe worthy. All in all, most probably the worst sci-fi movie I've ever watched. Compared to the pseudo-science and illogic of this movie, the guys from Star Trek really appear quite believable."
141," Pile of Sentimaental Crap
","Note - the last two lines sum it all up if you want to skip my blathering. Interstellar is nothing more than a sci-fi drama. If you crave sci-fi movies as I do, this film will leave you feeling unfulfilled and usurped. It is about nothing more than ""the human element"" set against a semi sci-fi backdrop that is obscenely absurd. Happy ending? Not really, and what makes it worse is that's predictable early on. Should you bother to watch this film? Yes, I watch them all, probably because curiosity gets the best of me, and who knows, you might like it. I have been disappointed, read enraged, by other films much more than this one, but it failed to impress me. Maybe if I had sat down to this one expecting to be disappointed it might have been better, but to be quite honest, the trailers make it out to be something totally different than what you get. Sad thing is, too much film marketing goes this same way these days."
142," Too long, too pretentious, too far-fetch
","The movie did not need to be almost three hours long...this was a great example of why it is a bad choice to let a director have the last say over edits, cuts, and length of a film. So many scenes could have been cut.The only interesting part of the film was when the characters finally made it to different planets. However, all the science leading up to the adventure of going to different galaxies seemed to be a lot of mumbo-jumbo...lots of theories and big words to confuse the audience so that we think it could be possible.The last thirty minutes almost was incomprehensible...the explanations of what happened in the earlier part of the film didn't make sense...but because it was explained with a serious voice talking and serious music behind it, people who don't understand quantum physics (which are most of us) will think it does.Plese Hollywood, reign in Christopher Nolen a bit."
143," This is not a Movie. This is an 'Experience'
","There used to be movies where the purpose of it might be giving entertainment, educating or enlightening them. But apart from most of the movies, 'Interstellar' is more than that. It is not a movie. You never realize that you spent 2 hrs 40 mins in the theater. It blends with you. It makes you a third person in the lives of the character watching then to go through all the experiences they have. This is not a movie, this is an absolute experience that everyone should experience. It educates you, It questions you wit to the maximum level possible (How many of you understand quantum physics and Wave theory?) It raises an in-numerous questions even to the researchers who are the top in this domain, Is that possible? The answer is yes and no at the same time. For believers, it is possible as explains the paradoxes and decodes how it is possible and for non-believers, there are always questions that cant be answered. Apart for science, the human connections are stupendous. It makes you to connect emotional not just to a character but to the future of the earth. And the best part in the movie is subtlety in the picturing it. There is enormous possibility of making it more of a scifi journey showing colorful planets etc etc. But Nolan used what is required without going for too much unnecessary visual elevations. The science, emotions, story & the screenplay are the best in the movie. It is an experience that everyone should experience. Question your wits !?"
144," Bit too overrated
","I am sorry but found this movie to be highly over rated. It was high on visual effects but low on the content in terms of script, story and the future of the world basically.I am sure it will grab few awards in these categories.There was a similar hype around Avatar but when I saw Avatar, it had something new to offer. Interstellar doesn't offer anything new as such.If you put the movie Gravity and the movie Frequency together in 5D, wormhole angle, you have Intersetllar.In fact I found Frequency to be highly underrated movie.Acting/Direction is good but wished the script were much more stronger."
145," vastly overrated
","reading the other reviews here its hard to conceive that I watched the same movie everyone is gushing about. the central premise is hardly noble although perhaps quite the likely selfish outcome i.e. after trashing this planet lets go trash some others. the black hole visualizations were quite lame. this is not a great sci-fi film even remotely in the league of 2001 although a cursory superficial viewing might suggest so to an unthinking non-sci-fi buff. a great scifi film would naturally start by 1st adapting a great scifi story. these are yet to be made such as ringworld, dyson spheres and fleet of worlds concepts. to think that all these mind boggling stories exist yet this rather old and tired story concept is chosen to lavish money on is strange, although it is somewhat understandable as the afore-mentioned stories would be much greater challenges all around and so its best that they are ignored rather than poorly realized as this primarily propaganda piece."
146," A Bit of a Disappointment
","When I first heard of the making of this film, I had reservations about it. Then, I learned that a well-known scientist(Kip Thorne) was attached to it as a technical consultant and my interest began to increase. Getting it right, scientifically, seldom works with the film industry, although there have been limited occasions where it has. Avatar, Kubrick's classic 2001 back in 1968, and one even further back, Forbidden Planet (1956) show that it can be done.With this in mind, I thought this might be one of those rare ones that could live up to my expectations. I mean, after all, Christopher Nolan and Thorne. How could it fail. I've always believed that, in order to make a quality science fiction film, you have to have a writer that knows what the genre is all about. In this case, there is not only the potential for quality writing from Nolan but also scientific expertise from one of the top scientist in the field - what could go wrong...go wrong.... Well, in spite of all that, it did just that.Yes, it was a visual treat that applied all the wonderful effects developed over the years. And it did that very well. But that's not enough anymore; at least not for me.What I experienced instead was story that was based on a premise that was faulty almost from the start with scientific shortcomings and implausible circumstances. And that's where the disappointment comes in for me. I can understand Nolan's possible lack of detailed knowledge of wormholes, time dilation, gravity effects, and the like, but how could a respected scientist like Thorne allow it? Unless of course he had little control over the film's production. Alas, that is probably the case.I'm not going into any detail about the the actual story because that is already well documented in other reviews. I end with a final summary and opinion: If you know little about that actual scientific aspects of the various theories touched upon in this film, you'll probably find it entertaining. If, on the other hand, you have sufficient knowledge of what we humans actually know of such things; you too, may be a bit disappointed."
147," Overrated mix of typical American Hollywood hero and sloppy storyline
","I really don't understand what everyone's great fascination is with this movie. There are a couple of good scenes, that are funny and have the right emotional level. There are some twists, that are way too predictable or too easily brushed off. While I used to like McConahey's acting, I think he has been way too over the top with his role in this one. I liked Anne Hathaway in a few of the scenes, as well as the daughter though. Character development is basically non-existent and I was pretty bored multiple times during the movie which left me disconnected to the characters and not caring about the end of the story. I really just hoped it would end at some point.While the science behind it is truly fascinating, the movie is neither outstanding nor is the story. It has potential but is just so underdeveloped."
148," Big disappointment. Not black hole but plenty of holes.
","Attention: there might be spoilers here, but otherwise it is just not possible to discuss the film, IMHO. So do not read further if you have not seen it yet. Actually it is the first Nolan film I see, and I am open-mouthed at the HUGE hype preceding it. The film does not fulfill the expectations in most ways. The worst is the insufferable dialogue, which forces good actors into ineptness, Matt Damon being a particularly sad example. The whole screenplay needed about twenty (thousand) revisions more. There are characters that are completely superfluous, so much that one gets killed without any repercussions in the plot at all. And they do not seem to have a use for the character Romilly, either, except getting older. The idea of the NASA chief being a villain is preposterous; why send people on a mission you know they are going to fail? And his own daughter? Since it is all secret, which gallery would he be playing to? (and mind you, Caine is one of the very very few convincing characters, the other ones being Ellen Burstyin and the robots). There are huge scientific errors too, in spite of Kip Thorne. To slow time so much in the water planet, the gravity would have to crush the astronauts in essentially the first instant. A solution would have been to have the planet (or the ship) move nearer the speed of light, but apparently nobody thought of that. Points are about as subtle as a kick in the stomach, and I fail to see why anybody would think the science is ""dense"" and the film is ""complex"". Special effects are good. of course, but not as much as the hype says. And, sorry, if you get near a black hole, you would be thinned out like spaghetti by the enormous gravity. It is just impossible not only to survive, but to get out. The ""They"" is just a ""Deus ex machina"" to save the main plot from its own inepcy, and since this is all supposed to be so scientific, their appearance in the plot is completely arbitrary and illogical. And what, pray, would be these ""quantum data""? Since the quantic theory applies only in extremely small dimensions, why go look for it in space?. Somebody thought it sounded cute, I guess. There was no need to be realistic and scientific if we are getting out of the mire by miracle. The ending is maybe the best part, at times moving, but the notion that somebody who has been in hospital and will be let out only in ""a couple of days"" can rush to a rocket and take off, without space suit, raining, or assistance, as if it was a bicycle, seems ridiculous. My first and last Nolan film, I suspect."
149," The only movie that brings me to tears everytime
","Apart from the great cinematography, storyline and acting. Interstellar will keep you on the edge of your seat.
The first time I watched it I was amazed that a film could be that awesome. Christopher Nolan is a true genius.
After the first watching I promised myself that I had to wait 5 years to watch it again. And I did! For 5 years I ignored everything about Interstellar so I would forget it and watch it like the first time. It worked and it was as good as the first time!
I could watch it over and over and never get bored"
150," Astonishing sci-fi
","Interstellar is an astonishing sci-fi film that's thought provoking, emotional, breathtaking and complex. Matthew McConaughey gives an incredible lead performance and Michael Caine, Jessica Chastain, Anne Hathaway, Mackenzie Foy and David Gyasi all give great supporting performances. Christopher Nolan's direction is phenomenal and with Hoyte Van Hoytema as director of photography, consistently visually stunning. The visual effects are flawless. It's extremely well paced and the music by Hans Zimmer is beautiful."
151," Marvelous , breathtaking and super stellar
","Quite easily the best movie I have seen in my life . As a student of science, I couldn't have appreciated it more."
152," How can this be rated so high by IMDb?
","This film is 2 hours and 49 minutes of slowly bleeding to death. The magnitude of actors is the only one thing that keeps my attention (e.g. when is Matt Damon inserted into this?). Such a disappointment. I'm very pleased that I waited until this was available on streaming services.The beginning, while slow and lacking character development (and somewhat unbelievable), is interesting. The end is completely ridiculous. I had a flashback to ""The Fifth Element"" where it was declared that love was the 5th element. Too much time spent on irrelevant side stories that added nothing. The ending is difficult to find realistic or plausible. I found myself wondering how this movie could have such high ratings on IMDb after being released over 1 year ago!As a scientist/engineer, I wanted to enjoy this film. I was woefully disappointed.For anyone interested, I'd watch The Martian long before watching this drivel. I'm shocked that this is #29 in IMDb's ""Top Rated Movies"", how did that happen?Brings into question how reliable IMDb really is with respect to objective movie reviews."
153," Most overrated movie in mankind's history!
","This is the movie that proves what many people by now have already realized: People are being payed to write 10 stars fake reviews! Let me tell you this: This movie is really NOT that great!First, it's too long. It takes one hour just for the space mission to start.It's slow paced and VERY sentimental, or, in other words, most of it is boring.I'm not an English native speaker, but my English is not bad either. I have no problems watching movies in English, and yet it was very hard for me to understand the main character's mumbling in his farmer accent. All other actors spoke properly, except him, the most important one.The plot is not very logical: Planets just in front of a giant black hole?! Yes, this must be the place to live everybody is dreaming of.Imagine your colleagues in the space station would say to you: ""OK, we're now ready to fly down to that planet. You wait here. Don't worry, we'll come back soon, in... some YEARS!"" You'd probably smile and say: ""Wonderful! OK, go now!"", right? One day they come back and are probably surprised to see you haven't committed suicide because of depression, even though you waited 23 years (!!!) for them. You must be the most patience man in the entire Universe.And again a female ""scientist"" who looks like a model and behaves like an amateur. An obligatory part of every sci-fi movie nowadays.This is just to give you an idea. There is much more, so read the other negative reviews.Good night. And good luck."
154," ABSOLUTE Over-hyped TOSH
",AM I THE ONLY ONE ON PLANET EARTH WHO THINKS THAT THIS FILM IS ABSOLUTE TOSH? Perhaps I'm being unkind because I could only handle an hour before walking out. I thought the acting in particular was very poor. The storyline is twaddle - a farmer with flight experience finds NASA in an unspecified location with a rocket that is going to save Earth - a typecast Michael Caine (thank goodness it wasn't Morgan Freeman) opens the boardroom door and there is the rocket!. It seemed to me that used actual rocket launch footage? The time element is misused and the special effects are not that great. I thought Elysium knocked socks off this film. I did semi enjoy the water sequence but it was at the point where they get back to the mother ship that I walked ................ very quickly out of the cinema. Ps I love Matthew McConaughey in true detective and I can't believe I was looking at the same actor
155," A very long piece of crap. Nolan's give us a break please !!!
","If you ever saw Kubrick's 2001 then do not waste your time in this movie. If you did not;then rent or buy 2001 and avoid this piece of crap.""INTERSTELLAR"" is a dumb and lazy written cash cow disguised as a philosophical statement. ""INCEPTION"" was the same thing (but less stupid and more entertaining or at least had more action and violence ) Do not be fooled by the concept; there are just one or two interested statements in this movie but taking three hours for that is excessive.The whole things must make sense in Nolan's depressing mind; the world is ending but people is still selfish enough to make matters worse. The movie has zero humor and the positive or hopeful message is as fake as the special effects.In fact; this is a movie about God; but Nolan's refuse to even refer about religion; so the movie is about ""something"" that is never clear and makes absolutely no sense. ***SPOILER AHEAD*** Without saying too much about the first ending (there is a second happy ending to ensure better box office receipts and is even more absurd ) why whoever could create such a device just pass the message and solve the problem ?. ***END OF SPOILER***McConaughey is talk is almost incomprehensible. Anne Hathaway is always good; but his character is under written. Jessica Chastain has to deal a completely absurd and unbelievable and over dramatized situations (and she does not succeed).In brief; do not commit the same error I made. Save your money for a better and more sincere money; this one is just a scam."
156," Miserable inter human nonsense
","Interstellar was supposed to be a cardinal point for mankind at this stage (2014) as far as technological science go and the perspective possibility or not of a new habitat in space.It let me so down! Instead of a true vision for the future Interstellar works out an ordinary Hollywood blockbuster that vegetates on emotional blackmail in a father daughter relationship. Sorry Christopher Nolan but this is not what I payed for! Why should man go into space if all he cares about is miserable inter human nonsense? The unprofessionalism of the astronauts is limitless. Austronauts don't go into space without a strict course. So not in Interstellar, in this movie the astronauts choose randomly with course to take. This is supposed to be science? Don't make laugh! What a drivel!"
157," Boring and cliché - the nice art of Hollywood trailers
","I've been waiting for this movie for over a year. Big fan of Nolan's work, except Inception.The movie is a soup of physics and personalities clichés, overstretched over 3 hours of beautiful visuals braided with a childish plot and stupid characters. A similar movie which comes to mind is Prometheus.There is absolutely no connection with the people involved, and each and every one of them became unlikeable at some point in time.The attempts to define the way people behave are as childish as the plot that reverts into itself. Worse than the worst episode from the Star Trek saga.Apparently Hollywood must stick with the trailers, as they are brilliant. The movies that follow are trash.Nolan should come down from the sky ego he's in, and start making good intelligent movies again. Such a pity...IMDb of 9.3?! How many paid people are there to score 10s?!"
158," Wants too much. Achieves almost nothing.
","It's not a bad movie, but it's ordinary at best. Dialogue is very clumsy at times. It's too long, and way too much time is spent on explaining phenomenons that don't need to be explained. It could have been such an elegant and thought provoking movie, but instead it's dead set on explaining absolutely everything. It ruins the mystery, and the opportunity for me to use my own imagination. Unfortunately the time spent making sure that everyone in the audience understands the movie EXACTLY the way the director wants you to, is spent, at the expense of a good storyline and the development of believable characters and meaningful relationships. A funny idea, and a powerful soundtrack, just doesn't cut it for me. I was very underwhelmed and disappointed, but go see for yourself."
159," Definitely not a new Space Odyssey
","I really, really waited this film. I got nothing that I expected from other's reviews and scores.Yes, it has some interesting pictures, it speaks about big issues, it gives you exciting moments, but after I left the cinema, I forgot what it was all about, because the mistakes and fails made me forget it. The biggest issue is that it is slow, and contrary to Space Odyssey, it is slow because it needs time to prove its own false truth. We need to accept that the guys who leave Earth are so stupid and non-professionals, that they can only make bad decisions. Nobody is such crazy to go down on a planet on which time goes so slow that the spacecraft above will burn lot of resources for 23 years while waiting the team to get back. A little boy can do a simple calculation, that going down and up needs more than one hour, so the remaining crew and station will spend a lot of time and resources. Much more than if they go to the other two planets. Still, they go down. And what the lonely guy does up on the station? Instead of putting the station into energy saving mode and going to sleep, he wastes the little resources they have. I see, so the director needed to spend all these resources and time to make the film more dramatic. However, contrary to this intention, from this scene, the film lost me. But there was an other contender earlier in the film which could have made me angry, but I noticed it only after this 23 years nonsense. Anybody can explain why a hibernation tank goes under a strange, dirty, concrete like something which is very much like some Eastern-European communist public bath's floor?! Is this science fiction? Or is this the Hostel? And it just can't stop. You are a scientist,right? You work from data, you trained to do so. There is scientific method, right? So when you get on an other planet and find a robot there in pieces, you just accept everything the man you find there says to you. You land on ice-clouds floating in the sky, but you accept that everything is fine here. You start to land your stuff on the clouds, however the resources to use is not on the clouds, but under. You notice nothing, right? What are you doing? And I should eat this and feel myself OK? The worst part? When love almost becomes law of physics. In the sixties, some kind of stupid philosophy could have been accepted. But now? Really? The girl, who has her own 'field of science', tries to explain to the others that they should go to her favorite planet because perhaps love is more than we see about it? Again: really? What more? Is it the dark matter holding the universe together?This supposed to be science-fiction, right? OK, we found science, and it is fiction, but a 'new Space Odyssey' should give you visions. This film gave me a useless journey and a huge space-station around Saturn at the end. Is this the solution? An old man sent a dozen men through a wormhole only to train a girl who finally understands that a space station is the solution humanity needs?!If you want to see this film, wait until you can watch it home on a boring Sunday afternoon. Don't waste your time otherwise."
160," Awful Beyond Imagining
","I was bored and love science fiction movies, so I saw half of ""Interstellar"" - way too much of it. Since I expected nothing, I wasn't disappointed: that's what I got. Few friends probably planned to see it, so there was no point in telling them not to. It has not a single redeeming feature, and shamelessly copies many films and TV series - 2001, not the least of them. I've seen better sci-fi on 50s or 70s television. It's 100% cliché-ridden from the git-go - the characters, the story, the actors (no acting is necessary!), the ""cinematography"" (almost non-existent) the music, the locations, the sets, even the editing. What an embarrassment, an insult. It's a film worthy of this year's midterm elections, as it cynically abandons all pretense and respect for imagination, experience, science, detail, creativity, or humor. It is written and plays to the lowest level of intelligence - the entire film does nothing but fulfill expectations set in the first few minutes. You might as well listen to the movie as a podcast. Matt McConnaughey has never been so stereotypically bad. I hope it destroys a few careers. It should."
161," Ouch! A painful journey through space, time and love.
","Let me start by saying, I'm certain I would more than struggle to make a better film. I am humbled by the energy, love and devotion required to produce the few moments that literally flash before our eyes. I also consider myself a huge fan of the Nolan brothers. Following, Memento, The Prestige, Inception, all films of exceptional quality and fantastic storytelling. For years, Christopher Nolan has worked literal movie magic, telling his audience exactly what to expect from the very beginning, yet delivering a performance that leaves them no less than astounded.Interstellar begins no different. Nolan practically hands the ending to the audience leaving little to surprise. But unlike previous masterpieces, Interstellar drags the audience on a painful, bumpy ride through space, time, love and death leaving some in hypnotic wonder. The rest, simply insulted, wishing for nothing more than to get back the past 169 minutes.""Stay,"" a message delivered by Cooper to his daughter across space and time, and yes, we knew it was him all along. ""Stay,"" the message potential viewers should hear loud and clear. ""Stay home."" It's safe and warm. Revisit Memento, The Prestige or Inception and marvel at the layered depth of stories told so well you ache for them to be told again and again and again. Perhaps next time the Nolans will deliver on that hope. Until then, ""Stay away"" from Interstellar."
162," More drama than sci-fi, should have been better.
","Christopher Nolan has made some great films, but alas, this isn't one of them. It's not a bad film, but as sci-fi, it misses the target. A film about alien life forms is credible, because it's possible, but a film that mumbles abstract nonsense about a relationship between quantum data, time and five dimensions, that puts a primary character behind a bookcase to observe what's going on in front of the bookcase while unable to communicate through the books had me shaking my head. And then, in what seemed like an eternity later, in a silly and inconvenient way he does communicate. Also, I'm still wondering about the significance of the drone chase sequence. Particularly distracting was when HE rose from the pod. Maybe if I'd known he was in the movie would have prepared me for it, but it came across as an unintended joke. And the constant crying by every one of the characters was just too much. Reportedly costing $165 million to make, the money sure doesn't show up on the screen. For all the questionable raves about the effects, among other things, I wasn't wowed by them at all. A dark color palette full of dull grays was far from inspiring, as good science fiction should be and it came across on the screen as being low budget to me. Visually, it was no Oblivion. The relationships and drama between the characters is the main focus of the film with space and time travel serving only as a device to advance and put some quirkiness into that plot line. As I said, it's not a bad film. Without the lofty expectations of seeing top notch sci-fi from a great film maker, it still had some good dramatic and emotional moments that held my attention, largely because the actors threw their all into it and because Hans Zimmer's great score made some overly long sequences seem way more exciting that they were. Here's hoping Mr. Nolan gets back on track next time out."
163," Made no sense and slow pace
","I believe that once people get on the band wagon they follow the hype of this move, hence the mega score of 9.5. I think Chris Nolan wanted to enter himself in the realms of Stanley 2001.I wont bore myself or anyone else, my major issues, 1. Why use Saturn rocket to launch out of earth when they had these cool ships in the rest of the movie to fly up and down from planets.2:They can go through worm holes, find earth like planets but cant detect its a frozen rock and the other has no land at all.3.If he could send a message to say STAY, why would he then have sent the co ordinates to NASA headquarters, why send anything at all.4.MATT DAMON, didn't fit role."
164," As a sci-fi fan i'm not impressed!
","Unfortunately the film didn't reach the high expectations I had for it! I love sci-fi movies but Interstellar left me flat and disappointed.First the opening hour of the film was boring and ordinary and the 'Earth's problem' with the sand storms was somehow underplayed and unmoving. I thought that maybe when they go in space things could get better... well, they did for a while but then the crew landed on the Ice covered planet and things got pretty sour.The idea of Cooper getting into the dimensional space and wrapping the story with the beginning was good but then again the end was OK and obviously left for a 2nd film.The sound was not good at all - I could barely hear and understand what they were saying, so maybe 50% of the films sound was a high pitched music overpowering the scenes.At the end I thought - this is a film for people who doesn't like sci- fi movies, don't believe in life in other planets and are narrow minded and believe only in conventional science. I suppose they got to watch something like that and like it...I appreciate the effort of everybody involved in this creation but it's not for me."
165," Horribly Boring.. No Plot.. no story whatsoever
","I rely on IMDb when it comes to decide what to watch and what not to watch. Rating of 9.2 looks so attractive that I didn't even bother to check the trailer. I went to watch the movie with very high expectations but was very disappointed. As I was watching it I was thinking maybe know it will start to make sense but it didn't even by the last scene. It was a total bollywood drama where hero doesn't die no matter where he is. The most funny part was when he press the eject button in space. It does has some big star cast but the base story line crumbles beyond imagination. It was like monkeys had written the script as they has shown in south park. Awful movie, total waste of time and money. Please go if you hate yourself or your life which is one and the same thing."
166," Interstellar: One of the best movies I've ever seen.
","OK, so I am not the type of guy that says that every movie is good but with Interstellar it is really hard not to. This is really a great movie. The story has been put together very careful and is extremely hard to follow but when you understand it, you realize that it is a good movie. Interstellar made me think about the science of the universe. And since a lot of information is correct in the movie (the content witch is used in the movie is what we are seeing in class right now) it can be in some way educational. But a lot of content they use is based on possible things. for example: I think is is a real possibility that there is a 4th dimension bus for us humans it is very hard to imagine that. But they make that unimaginable 4th dimension accessible for people. But since we and some scientists are not sure that the unknown information is true, is it awesome how the movie sticks together. Interstellar: Great plot, it is awesome how the people who made interstellar take our imagination for a spin, and make the possibility that the content of the movie is reality so realistically possible. That is what makes this movie so greatWout Selosse, Sunday the 9th of November at 11am, Belgium."
167," Mix of Spielberg's warmth, Kubrick's brain and Malick's beauty
","Interstellar is a jaw-dropping, awe-inspiring, beautiful, complex and thrilling adventure.The film is a mix of Spielberg's warmth, Kubrick's brain and Malick's beauty.Visually it is one of the best film ever made if not the best. Totally, is it the best film ever made? i don't know. A film of this scope and ambition is sure to have some narrative flaws here and there but it is beyond my ability to judge a film like this and find flaws in first viewing. May be i need to see it again to find any flaws, hell why should i find flaws while enjoyed it immensely. Performances were great. Hans Zimmer music was terrific and loud at times. Endurance docking and ghost subplot gave me chills. Some of the stuff is hard to understand like the Gravitational singularity, Relativity and 5 Dimensional space. But Nolan connected the dots between them very efficiently and mixed them with love and humanity. If you are a sucker for these things, the film will transcend you into it or else it feels overly sentimental. Don't miss it. I recommend you to watch it in IMAX if possible."
168," I so wanted to love this flawed space epic
","I love science fiction. I love Chris Nolan films. I love creativity, genius, art, film making. I just didn't love this film.Firstly, the plot was obvious, the 'ghost' was incredibly transparent right from the moment it's mentioned for example. Michael Caine is, as always, perfectly cast but somehow feels completely overused now in a Nolan film and it showed here. I understand the need for gravitas and an A-lister but for Interstellar it has become a tired cliché. Matt Damon ? My God, it's full of (film)stars but the bonkers astronaut was done better with Sunshine. Matthew and Anne put in fine performances but the connection is lacking. And frankly, I really expected so much more than the contrived 'love and humanity' theme. When Anne waffles her way through her reasoning for a particular decision point in the film I had to do a mental 'double-take'.This film tries so hard to be a 2001: A Space Odyssey for the millennial generation and fails. Even the heavy organ soundtrack is too reminiscent of Kubrick. I'm not sure if it's supposed to be homage or a meant as a direct comparison. All it needed was a bunch of monkeys.The visuals: they're good, but they're not spectacular like everyone gushes. I think Gravity held more beauty and impact than this. The wormhole sequence, despite clinging to science and projecting an image of a 3 dimensional gateway as closely as possible was just flat.The best scenes ? You'll wish you saw more of TARS and CASE, the robots that look like 2001 monoliths miniaturised. They have the best lines.I've always paid to watch a Nolan film more than once at the cinema, in some cases 3 or 4 times because of the story, acting and visual impact. I have no inclination to do so for this film, and that has shocked me most of all."
169," Masterpiece ? Really ?
","Rating this film a 'masterpiece' on any scale is preposterous.Gushy, weepy and incoherent. Everyone is crying trying to figure out what dimension they are in and finally they discover it was all about them and they are in love and weep some more."
170," Nolan misfires with mumbo jumbo
","I was ready to like this film, given his work on The Dark Knight, Memento and Inception. Of course, I was worried about the casting - McConaughey doesn't belong in an intelligent sci-fi, and Hathaway should only appear in movies doing a bad English accent in a lush period drama, but I was hoping for he best.SO we get McConaughey mumbling for literally the first hour, during the course of which almost nothing at all happens. It's so bad you have to turn the sound up. And then of course we meet Hathaway, who is to acting what Genghis Khan was to community relations. And then, implausibly, we see them sent up in a rocket to save the planet, which is followed by some nice visuals and ludicrous plotting before the end which is almost as bad as Bobby Ewing waking up in a shower. SO it was predictable, absurd, and poorly acted which leads to the question why are people falling over themselves to say how great it is? I suspect it's because McConaghey is the man of the moment, and Nolan considered a genius. Which people think mean they can do no wrong.Which is a disappointing conclusion to reach."
171," Absurd
","I was very disappointed after seeing this movie. Especially after having read so many positive reviews. The portrayal of physics and astronomy here is so pseudo-scientific and so preposterous that I found myself constantly sighing or scratching my head all throughout the movie. I don't have a degree in astronomy or any other science field for that matter but the scientific freedoms that this movie takes are so incredibly blatant and obvious that even I found myself bothered by them. Even for a sci-fi it's far too liberal in this regard.But that's not the only problem with this movie. The characters are paper-thin... and the way events unfold is often irrational or portrayed in a very contrived manner. For example, an Ex Nasa pilot stumbles upon a secret NASA base (which he found by interpreting strange dust formations into binary code which he then somehow immediately knew were map coordinates - makes so much sense, huh?) where he is immediately offered to pilot their only rocket which is to save mankind and is to launch the FOLLOWING day, because all their pilots are inexperienced and have only flown in simulators, whereas the protagonist has flown before, MANY YEARS back, and only BARELY leaving the atmosphere. But that's fine, they're sure he can manage an intergalactic journey, involving many years of travel, deep-space hibernation, traveling through a wormhole and finding a new world to save mankind. No need for any training or a medical check of course, surely he'll be just fine, he just needs to show up tomorrow for the launch. Incredibly, when our hero performs the greatest feat of space exploration ever - traveling through a wormhole, he and his crew-mates just play it cool, the feat is given no more significance than a casual stroll through a park. There are quite a few other examples too where the plot is painfully contrived and makes the whole movie difficult to take with even a bit of seriousness. Another thing that completely broke the immersion was the very unscientific language that was used all throughput the movie. A movie that was supposed to be about space exploration and science... You'd have to be mentally challenged to actually believe that this insultingly simplistic chit-chat resembles anything close to actual scientific language that high level NASA scientists, professors and engineers would use. This is nothing short of an insult to our intelligence...I'll end by saying I really fail to comprehend how people claim this to be the best sci-fi movie ever... It seems to me that we're stooping lower and lower in our expectations of what makes a film great. It's almost a standard now to expect a movie to be bad when reviews are surprisingly positive."

173," Plot holes and dead-ends, virtually no character development.
","I went to see Interstellar excited to see both a sci-fi film and the new Christopher Nolan film; I left feeling as though I hadn't seen a film at all but nearly three hours worth of undeveloped characters stumbling from one inexplicable and unnecessary plot twist to the next. Nolan intentionally keeps many of the details of his future world hidden, however, is so clumsy with the details that he does provide that by the end of the film the plot comes together to seem like an utter farce. None of the characters are developed enough for the audience to identify with them and as a result the numerous and lengthy close-ups of teary eyed individuals is tedious and tiresome. Many capable actors are kept to only a few relatively insignificant lines but then later reveal massive plot shifts only moments before being killed off. This drastically reduces the emotional impact of the film despite how clearly Nolan is trying to tug at the audience's heart strings. Even the pace of the film (typically a strength of Nolan's) is way off. Much like Inception and the Batman series, Nolan whisks the story along inviting you to forget one or two potential plot holes in order to keep the audience engaged. However, in Interstellar, the plot holes are far too big to ignore and the fast pace often ends with a dead-end plot development. It feels as though Nolan is rushing through individual sequences just to land his plot right back where it started. By the third act, the audience is left wondering what was really accomplished by the first two. The greatest let-down of the film comes at the crescendo, with the audience eagerly awaiting at least some explanation of the numerous confusing plot twists. No such catharsis is offered because it was never intended. The film ends much as it began, disjointed and seemingly without direction. I realize that this review will seem quite vague to most readers who have not seen the film: I have tried hard to avoid spoiling any plot details. But let me be clear about one thing. The mysteries contained in this film are not well calculated omissions to keep the audience wondering, (as in Kubrick, Lynch or even Nolan's Inception) but clear inconsistencies that the director hopes he can distract the audience from through pacing and special effects. What he misses is that good pacing comes from good acting as much as directing. And good special effects only work when the audience isn't preoccupied with wondering why this particular sequence is happening in the first place. Nolan would do better to cut out many of the unnecessary plot twist sand spend more time letting the many capable actors tell his story and draw the audience in. In Kurick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, the most compelling, emotional performance of the film was given by a Robot named HAL. Nolan achieves the same feat in Interstellar with the robot TARS. However, in Interstellar, this is not so much a testament to the director's ability to get the audience to empathize with a machine (as Kubrick did) but a statement about how poorly Nolan was able to tell the story through any of the human characters."
174," Maybe it is just me......
","For me, Nolan is becoming like M Night......He has reached that point, or some producer, where they continually push and try to top whatever was done in the past. Yes, that should entirely be the case.....but not to a point of stupidity.M Night tried to always shock, and that stupidity moment was The Happening.No pun intended, but I didn't feel that the characters really understood the Gravity of the situation, they never seemed to be bothered, and I mean really bothered about the loss of time. For example....do you think after travelling 2 years away from my kids with the prospect of never seeing them again, that I am going to accept a team mates stupidity that leads to the death of someone and the loss of 23 years? Seriously, there would be some trouble afoot!!! Do you think a character that has sat around waiting for said folks to return after 23 years would be in any state to continue with the mission? Have some coca and lets get on our way........The killer for me was the last scene where the main character is shunned and ignored by his grand kids, and great grand kids. Yes, get out of the hospital, Murph wants to be around her family..... No one seems to truly acknowledge that the hero of the planet was of any worth, and he is pretty cool with that!I can handle he Blight, the 5 dimension, the space travel and more, I just cannot abide by inhuman behavior......Exit by stealing a space craft with Deep Blue.......sigh........."
175," Wreck of a movie, hard to find anything good about it
","Christopher Nolan once again gives more than enough evidence that he is the most overrated director in modern Hollywood. How is it possible to have such a premise (interstellar voyage to save human race) and make such a boring movie? It beats me, but what puzzles me even more is how it is possible to make a movie with almost no character at all. What is this movie about? It's not about an interstellar voyage, that's for sure. It ain't about discoveries, either. (imagine a group of explorers who are some of the first people to land on another planet and they are excited as my 90+ year-old grandmother is when she cooks dinner) It ain't about aliens either. It ain't about saving humanity either, there is hardly any people shown except for one village somewhere in USA. Can you really tell a story that big by wrapping it around just a few people? In theory you can and it could actually work if it made any sense. But to end the movie they it was done here, by placing a portal inside a black hole which is designed to connect only two specific people, two specific people who have accidentally found NASA's basement top-secret James Bond project - it is beyond me. Once Cooper started texting his daughter in Morse code through this portal I felt embarrassed. I felt embarrassed for Nolan brothers. That's it? That was the grand idea which connects the loose ends and saves humanity? I wish Matt Damon had killed them all, it would have been more interesting and much more plausible than this mess. His anger actually makes sense, who wouldn't be frustrated with a plot like this? I believe a big portion of estimated 165 million dollar budget went into paid reviews here on IMDb."
176," Good Directors do not (necessarily) make good writers
","Some directors can pull of the feat of writing and directing, Tarantino comes to mind. PT Anderson is another. Even though this was co-written between Christopher Nolan and his brother, the Coens they are not!This movies is a perfect example of how making a movie (as my amateur film maker friend put it) is like building a cathedral. Being good at making stain glass does not make you a good brick layer, and that task is best left to ones who know what they are doing. To whit, we have this monstrous piece of pretentious drivel which attempts, as so many big hollywood movies do, to gloss over hastily written sequences with flash and bombast. This is another movie that feels like it was written by a committee of executives who were barely aware of the history of film and watched a couple of youtube videos on The Grand Unified Theory and tried to write something all smart-like. This movie is so scattered and convoluted it's hard to begin, and many other reviewers have pointed a lot of the plot elements that are glossed over with yet another ""yeah, that happened, deal with it"". Here are some of the things that I audibly groaned over:Why not explain what happened to Earth when every other part of this movie is explained like the audience is 5 years old?If the technology is available to build spacecraft with cryogen chambers, how about producing new forms of food? Lab grown meat for example? Hydroponic greenhouses etc?Why are the robots basically mechanical jenga pieces? How does that design make sense? The robot REALLY bothered me, especially how there was absolutely no effort to actually make it sound like a robot, it basically sounded like exactly what it was, which most of the time was just a guy inside a cheap plastic box. His voice didn't even sound like it was coming out of a speaker. HAL sounded like a person, but still had a creepy quality to him that sounded vaguely artificial (""what a moment, wait a moment"").And then there is the idea that you could actually get anywhere near a black hole (let alone wormhole) with relatively recent technology and survive. I have a rudimentary understanding of physics, but even I know that the radiation would turn you into goo pretty fast, space suit or no space suit.And a guy waits in a spaceship for 23 years by himself and doesn't go insane and looks basically the same except for a few grey hairs in his beard? I could go on and on....This movie tries really, really hard, there is a lot of balling actors showing off their chops and trusting that they are making a masterpiece, which I imagine every actor must do, but alas there is no saving this movie. It tried too hard to be all things, part 2001: A Space Odyssey, part Armageddon, part Inception and fails on all counts. Everything about this movies hints at greatness, the effects, the Phillip Glass like score written by Hans Zimmer, the tears swelling up at climactic scenes, but it is all empty packing around a bad story. This movie is a shiny car with hamsters on a wheel as the engine.One positive outcome of this movie is that it has reminded me to read about physics out of interest, but not to discuss them like I know anything, as I will come across as pretentious as this movie.I suggest everyone watches 2001 to cleanse their pallet and to be reminded of what truly great film making is about."
177," I resent this film
","I resent its cynically shallow pessimism disguised as apple pie sentimentalism, its artistic laziness & its technical sloppiness. I resent its condescending attitude towards its audience. By virtue of its sheer popularity on IMDb it's a testament to the colossal, continuing dumbing down of movie audiences.Where to start on specifics? The premise of a world-wide drought (a major blooper mentioned on this site) with tall green stalks of healthy looking corn. Okra grown as a major food crop (or was that supposed to be a joke)? Cut & paste interviews from a Ken Burns documentary abut the real dust bowl. The tiresome cheapie ""homages"" to Kubrick's 2001. The pedantic Astrophysics for Dummies lectures.The soap opera characters. The one dimensional acting. The utter predictability of every single plot twist. I'd get more specific, but then I'd be blacklisted for including spoilers. You want to see imaginative mind-blowing science-fiction/fantasy film making? Let me make 2 suggestions: Stalker and Solaris. Both Russian films directed by Andrei Tarkovsky. Far lower budgets than Hollywood blockbusters but works of pure genius. Avoid the American version of Solaris. It's a travesty, though not quite as awful as Interstellar. In summary the sheer numbing dullness & stupidity of Interstellar (& its concomitant popularity) managed to knock me into the worst state of depression I've experienced from a movie in years."
178," A classic? Nope, more like a Heinz 57 varieties
","I had high expectations for this film by Chris Nolan. ""Inception"" was ground breaking, you could definitely say it had never been 'done before' or seen that before! The pre release hype was strong for Interstellar and I really enjoy SF movies, so pass the popcorn!SPOILERS: Firstly character wise...There is zero chemistry between Cooper and Dr. Brand! Yet in the end, we're being told/shown that there is/will be? Really? Then Dr. Mann, he was asleep for years and when they wake him, they don't verify his claims? And his mental status? Why was he sent on this mission in the first place? And he easily removes the communication device from Cooper's helmet, and so on. Really cheesy and poorly written. Then he escapes in the craft to get to the Endurance, hello? No security protocols? It is so unbelievable.Time flashbacks...Cooper can revisit time, so why not pick a time he can really affect? Maybe further back and even help to prevent the natural environmental breakdowns that Earth is experiencing in this story.Robots...black monoliths...hello where have I seen that before? Is this the shape that a space exploration robot would be designed as? This was so silly I couldn't stop laughing!Fuel: They have a limited supply! OMG! Ever hear of nuclear power like in a submarine, etc? Also I would expect them to have perfected nuclear fusion or such to provide unlimited (almost) power. But no, they use chemical rockets (technology from the 1940's). This was so poorly written.Let's not forget 'Waterworld' even, when they land on the water planet. Gee, maybe a survey/probe first would be in order? And then the other planet, looked a lot like the ice world in the 'Star Trek' movie a few years ago where Jim Kirk is exiled to and meets Spock.And the most bizarre of all? He gets coordinates of a TOP SECRET base and he's just the person they want to fly the spacecraft? And no one else could find this base? Did the workers there need food from local providers? Anyways, you get my point, it is so disjointed and when you watch it, it is a melange of many previous movies, hence Heinz 57 varieties. It carries bits of '2001 A Space Odyssey' (and its sequels also) which is a natural one to look to. Then 'Contact' and many more...truly picking experiences from a bevy of SF movies and mixing them. At least they didn't have thruster sounds in space! (no sound in space, remember 'Aliens'? No one will hear you scream!) Is this the best that Chris Nolan and Hollywood can come up with? No original screenwriter/story out there? My final measurement of a film is will I buy the Blu-ray disc when it comes out? Nope, not for this extremely long and drawn out film. I might buy it in the cheapo bin for $3.99 in a few years time and watch it just for the extras/deleted scenes and then put it on the shelf to gather dust.So just like in the movie, I was hoping for a worm hole to get to the end of this long drawn out tedium...but unfortunately for me, time was actually going to be moving much longer than normal time and I've lost 3 hours of my life I'll never get back. So terribly disjointed with decent actors trying to save it.Unless you are starving for a SF movie, avoid this like a bad worm hole and keep your feet planted on terra firma. Folks, this is a really terrible movie and I would avoid it and save your money for something else."
179," Pretentious mess with nice visuals
","I loved most of Nolan's films. Memento, The Dark Knight are among the best movies I've watched. Sadly I can't say the same about Insterstellar. I can't understand what happened with Nolan on this movie. The plot is a complete mess, filled with arbitrary nonsense they dare call science. It spends time explaining what a wormhole is and then it throws in some metaphysical bs about the fifth dimension which does not make any sense. This is not a sci-fi film it is a fantasy movie. The visuals are the only redeeming quality this movie has. But however great they are, they cannot save this mess of a movie. Weak, forced acting with dull dialogue makes this one of the weakest movies I've seen this year."
180," Pure unadulterated dog squeeze. Torture!!
","There is no way on earth that these positive reviews are real. This was, hands down, the worst movie experience of my life. It made Shark Boy and Lava Girl seem like a masterpiece. (Both of these movies were seen at the urging of the same son---albeit almost a decade apart). I cannot believe I ruined date night with my wife over this 3 hour hell-fest. I alternated between scratching my head, holding back laughing, wanting to yell out jokes about Lincoln commercials and not being able to hold back laughing. Based on the looks from everyone else as they were leaving the theater, we all shared the same sentiments. Go ahead, blow $10 on this miserable, ridiculous, implausible pile of poopy that would make M Night Shamalyan scream out ""you have got to be friggin' kidding me"" at the movies attempts at plot twists."
181," I Had To Stop Watching...
","It starts off with a farmer (Independence Day style), and then we are quickly transported into a world where the planet is doomed because... well... we're not really sure why, but it involves a lot of wind.Then NASA gets involved and our heroes get sent into a kind of 'space' that comes complete with bad paintings of old 'hubble' pictures, lots of 'space' type language... and gravity. The gravity is ever present. Nothing ever floats about, and they get 'skipped' off the orbit around Mars before whizzing past Saturn (it has rings) and arriving at a black hole. They get through the black hole (like that's possible), by looking slightly concerned and talking like cowboys.The robots look and act like corn flake boxes, the humans (mostly well known), look bemused... and at that point... I had to stop watching. I was hoping it was all going to turn out to be a joke... but it wasn't.I don't like ranting, so I won't. Suffice to say that if the Earth has to end... at least let it explode before Hollywood can make another 'turkey' like this.Embarrassingly bad."
182," Awful Film
","The good reviews of Interstellar on IMDb are proof to me that movie studios pay people to post positive reviews of movies. The current IMDb rating is 9.1......no way in hell is that an accurate rating.This movie is awful...period. How could any professional actor read the script for this movie and not be able to tell that it will be a terrible movie?I really would like to say something positive about the film since it has many of my favorite actors in it. The actor list reads like a ""who's who"" of movie stars. But I cannot think of one single positive thing to say about it.Trust me, don't waste 3-hours of your life on this film. You will regret it, just like I do."
183," Worst science in a serious movie ever
","This movie attempts to be serious and it has good believable science in it but then they do things that just make you want to scream at the writers. If you are going to ask me for suspension of disbelief please be a little consistent.A space ship takes off from earth boosted with a three stage rocket about the size of a Saturn 5 rocket. That same ship can then take off and reach orbit from two alien worlds with out any boosters, including one planet so far down a gravity well that there is a time dilation of one hour to 7 years. At one point three ships are moving away from a black hole with no thrust but when the smaller ships separate from the larger one they immediately fall back into the black hole. There is a 300 foot ocean swell on a planet where the ocean is only 1 foot deep.It seems like every time the writers wanted to add some plot device into the story they added a new convenient constraint to their universe. For example you can communicate normally in one direction through their worm hole but only a few bits per day in the other direction. Our hero is an ex-NASA pilot who even though hasn't been in contact with NASA for 20 years is given the task of piloting their latest ship.I hope anyone who took high school physics would feel insulted by this movie."
184," Disappointing on several fronts
","Got to watch it on in IMAX format last night and found the IMAX experience disappointing, still trying to understand if the effort to shoot in 70mm was worth it. Same low def, blurry type of delivery as watching Gravity on a plane. Mentioned Gravity at the outset, as it comes to mind more often while watching Interstellar than Kubrick's 2001, I guess not what Nolan brothers were shooting for... So, a 2nd display of spinning debris in the cosmic emptiness in 12 months, while trying to make this cinematically thrilling and engaging denotes some sort of gumption, not that Hollywood haven't seen that kind of FX sequeling so many times. Let's say that making movies in 2014 about stuff in space is not easy, in a space where sound waves don't travel and silent movies are long extinct for a reason. Interstellar however is not a very quiet movie at all, lot of vibrating spacecraft and gripping soundtrack as fillers. Kubrick got that right back in 68 using the Blue Danube to keep us connected to the scenes that everyone ever since used as textbook on any extraterrestrial imagery. Nolan is telling a very simple story in a not very precise and confident rendering, adding several disjointed mini-stories in the main one, and ending it with the grand reunion of all characters that have not died explicitly on screen after 2 and a half hours and basically telling the world that time travel is possible and it will be soon available at a farm near you.I will be brief on my rating of the main cast: Matt McCon is looking more and more like Peter Newman in the 70s and getting pretty good, followed by Jess Chastain with solid delivery, the rest are a mess: Anne Hathaway is 3/10 and Matt Damon, boy ... what happened to him ? Michael Caine is OK, but no cigar. The plot is pretty shabby when looked from above (pun intended)and the mini new age anecdotes are kept in check until the last half hour when we are subjected to full blown loss of control over what/when/how/where.. anything goes, keep calm and wait until everyone's standing up.Wait for the video."
185," Wouldn't recommend.
","8.8? I'm just not feeling it.Total ""snoregasm"", I swear. It's VERY slow to start, then disappointing once it does get going. I'm one of those that has to finish nearly every movie and book I start, no matter how bad. It took me 3 days to finish watching because I could only stand about 40 boring ass minutes at a time. Quasi-science muddled with current theory and overstretched artistic license, and let's face it; McConaughey as ""humanities last hope""? Yeah, we'd be screwed. He's not altogether that bad, but in reality the coolest thing about him is his Air-stream. The improbability levels in the ""science"" and the story make it difficult to get into it."
186," Good cinematography, very poor plot
","Judging solely on cinematography, this movie is excellent. With shots ranging from side views of space craft to wide shots of alien landscape, this movie is well done through a filming perspective. But the plot is a completely different situation.(Please note this is more a list of my biggest complaints and not a complete summary, thus many of the arguments will be more rambling than cohesive due to lack of describing every signal plot point.) The first 30 minutes present the situation on Earth very well, and also presents the problem of relatively well about a hour in. But the largest problem in the beginning of the movie is the lack development of the brother. He seems almost bastardized than loved and can be seen as a large problem from the beginning of the movie.After the first hour the plot begins to break down. The characters have to decide which planet as to go to. Amelia begins the debate with reasonable facts and figures. Cooper then presents the idea that Mann was the strongest of the group and his data was promising. Amelia presents some flaws with the argument and then Cooper makes a personal attack by saying that she is in love with the man on the planet she wants to go to. Ultimately they choose to go to Mann's planet. This particular scene was poorly done because it showed two people, who were chosen for their level headiness and reasoning, resort to using the most irrational arguments that could be formulated to, arguably, make the most important decision of humanity.Dr. Mann is presented in the later half as a predictable antagonist who is presented as a weak coward, but some how was able to live isolated on a planet for many years without killing himself. Mann has little reason to betray his fellow astronauts other than to save himself, yet doesn't attempt to persuade the others to leave with him.After Mann is disposed off, Cooper (Mathew McConaughey) seems to have omnipotent ability to fly a ship by feel in space and be precisely accurate as to where he is going, and sends his fellow astronaut to a barren planet to save some portion of humanity.While on Earth, Cooper's son, who is not as loved as Cooper's daughter, becomes an incoherent lunatic that lacks any basic reasoning. The daughter needing to find some clue for the equation in her room, burns her brother's fields. Even though the daughter attempted to move the family out of the house and get to the room without violence, she burns the fields without attempting to reconcile.By far the largest problem of the movie is its deus ex machina, ""the fifth dimension"". The movie presents the fifth dimension as love, and makes blatant foreshadowing to this in first half of the movie at the beginning of the movie. In a movie that presents its self as intelligent and competent of science, then it would know to some degree that love is essentially a chemical in the brain. To change from a scientific view with unknowns about the universe to having love being a metaphysical object is absurd. It would have been better to present the human mind as the fifth dimension rather than one emotion.Through the use of the fifth dimension, Cooper enters a black hole transmit data back to his daughter through time and saves humanity. In essence, future Cooper sends past Cooper into the worm hole. All with the help of future humans that created the fifth dimension in the black hole. Thus the movie at the same time created a preposterous dimension and a time traveling paradox.The ending ultimately was lack luster, with an exception of Cooper meeting his daughter for the last time. Cooper is found by the colonization ships and then goes off to find his fellow astronaut.The movie is three hours, which is far too long for such a predictable and hole ridden plot.In total, for the price of one ticket you get pretty awesome visuals, occasionally good character development, and a horribly flawed plot."

Usually this kind of movie is subdued, restrained, small in scale -gives you the space you need to think. They present us with a conundrum and let us solve it -if it can be solved at all.This movie is the exact opposite of that. Nolan movies are not known for subtlety and restraint -and this one might be the loudest, biggest, and I'm afraid dumbest of them all. The movie grabs you by the throat and slap you in the face a million times, yelling ""we have serious problems here and this is the solution, and if there is a later twist I'll just give you a louder new solution, but don't you dare objecting to what you're given"". Even the supposedly intimate scenes feel like instructions: when we see Dr. Cooper crying over his daughter's cruel recorded message, we almost see a cue card in the background ""... and now, dear audience... cry!"".To worry about the future of mankind is absolutely valid. To make room for human emotions in scientific problems is even more valid. But to spend three hours of dazzling visual effects and loud background music to tell us what we should think about all that is cheap and worthless."
190," Dull, over-long better read a good book or watch 2001: A Space Odyssey
","This is perhaps the worst space movie I've ever seen. Confusing, useless dialogue, over-long, slow, boring. The director tried to copy 2001 A Space Odyssey with no luck. Better watch this film or read a good book. The plot is easily understood by scientists like Carl Sagan or Stephen Hawkins but not for Joe Average, black holes, gravity effect etc. It shows interesting subjects but they could have been better written, making the movie much more attractive and interesting. What a waste of good acting and nice production design. One of the worst aspects of the movie is that actor McConaughey doesn't vocalize clearly and it is very difficult to understand his words. He must study with Henry Higgins (My Fair lady) so he can learn some phonetics!! But he is a very good actor, wasted on this film."
191," Anti-science fiction
","This movie is incorrectly classified as science fiction. It is actually anti-science fiction and, by the way, in all other matters a serious insult to any person's intelligence. The problem with directors these days, even supposedly talented ones like Nolan, is that they try to appeal to everyone and end up appealing to no body. Big money talks louder I guess. Damn you Hollywood.But what pisses me off about this movie is its anti-scientific and anti-technological approach. The subliminal message, that perhaps makes most Nolan fan-boys mentally masturbate about, is that you should not care about rationality, you have to use the power of LOVE and screw logic thinking. OK, so why the pseudo-science mambo-jumbo? If you want to do a Terence Malick trick, don't mess around with science. Being a physicist myself I am of course more sensitive to science fiction plot (worm/black) holes - especially these kind that completely suck any credibility out of it. But even if you are not scientifically literate, and this movie surely is not meant to appeal only to scientists, you should feel insulted. I won't go into any details, just because the ""pencil through a paper of sheet"" wormhole explanation or the ""oyster and pearl"" analogy really raised the bar way to low for me to care about it anymore. Sending ""quantum data"" to solve an ""equation""... WTF? Just throw in the ""quantum"" word and that's it. Sorry to tell you, but ""quantum data"" means nothing. There is no such thing. No quantum physicist uses that expression for anything meaningful, especially in the lack of any recognizable context. Surviving through a black-hole trip (cough cough); talking to your Minecraft-designed robot (seriously??) while you're in the ""3 dimensional box, inside a 5 dimensional universe..."" WTF? It's just stupid, childish and downright ridiculous. Pseudo-science rubbish, which pisses off scientists and sends a completely wrong message to everyone else about what science is all about. Science is about rational thought, passion also of course, but mostly about consistent and carefully constructed logical thinking. This movie is the antithesis of any logical thinking. Just because, you know, love. I enjoy a good, deep, emotional story but the crappy pseudo-science completely spoils it. Kids, this is not science fiction. I am deeply disappointed. Thanks for that Mr Nolan!! Comparing this movie to 2001 Space Odyssey is outrageous, both Mr Kubrick and Mr Arthur C Clarke would be deeply embarrassed to find out that their legacy would be turned into this.Save your money and wait for a BR rip, if you really like being intellectually insulted. MR Nolan didn't do anything to deserve getting your money in his bank account."
192," what a mess.
","I heard Nolan answer a question about authenticity of the scientific basis of the movie. He 'fessed to changing things up but then said — and I agree with him — that audiences are OK with IF the movie is consistent within itself. Unfortunately, Interstellar is far from consistent. How the black hole is treated in completely nonsensical. Light doesn't escape but he and his ship, nor the bot, are stretched out into spaghetti by the gravity. Said hole is at first a safe enough distance away from the ice planet to not be a factor, but is then close enough to 'capture' their ship in it's vortex. Why oh why did the super-evolved humans (huh?, in and of itself) put that wormhole way out in the 'burbs and then leave a riddle within a black hole on the other side of it if their intention was to save humanity. Couldn't they have been just a little bit more direct, if they can alter gravity on the micro, high resolution level. Come to think of it, if the point of the black hole was simply to house the library thing, why wasn't that simply out in plain view? Seems a lot more sensible than having to conjure up the circumstances whereby someone would think that ENTERING AND SURVIVING A BLACK HOLE WAS POSSIBLE, LET ALONE A GOOD IDEA?!? And wasn't that actually a worm-hole, since he was looking in on the room? why did the other one require an acid trip of a tunnel to get to the other side? Why oh why is their only A SINGLE PERSON (caine) on earth working on that gravity equation? Oh, and then McConaughy's daughter, after 40+ years, which makes two.No MRIs and they whip up that space-ship (presumably one of many) in a few years. And suddenly have all that high-tech medicine, despite the lack of tomography. And cryogenics? And why are they tooling around Saturn 100 years after getting mcconaughy's message, instead going through the worm-hole to salvation, or even sending anyone else to help out Lonesome Anne? Matt Damon and McConnaughy wander off ON FOOT on the glacier and yet it takes comparatively ages for the ship to JJET TO THEIR LOCATION. they must have been fit dudes to accomplish that distance on foot on that terrain.Infuriating. The best thing was the 'music', more accurately awesome, polyphonic blasts (I mean that in a good way). I know it made it hard to hear some of the dialog, but that wasn't such a bad thing."
193," Not The Film I Expected By A Long Shot
","The problem is... Stellar is so complex and confusing you are at the mercy of tying together so many scientific issues you get bogged down in the constant slow dialog and the dragging delivery of the twists and turns of what has got to be the most complex multi-plotted movie I've seen in years. I sensed ""overkill"" of some scenes that seemed constantly drawn out that if I had a remote I would have fast forwarded through many parts. I am a big Sci-Fi movie lover and as such I will bring huge praise to the writers and producers of well made movies of this kind. Before going to see this much anticipated film that was given spectacular and high praise from several cites such as IMDb, I was dumbfounded by what appeared to be a movie almost impossible to find fault with in those reviews. Whats more this film was much too long (2 hrs 55 minutes) including previews of trailers. No human bladder should be put to such an ungodly test. Lastly I want to again point out that many reviews are suspect in this world of questionable truths of opinion."
194," Sappy sentimentality and silly science
","'Memento' and 'Inception' had some problems, but their ideas stretched the imagination. 'Interstellar' only delivers the bombastic silliness one would expect if a puffed-up Batman director thought he could eclipse Kubrick's '2001' with a puerile adventure story. Christopher Nolan's new film begins badly and steadily declines as its long-winded prologue introduces the stereotypical elements of a Steven Spielberg/Norman Rockwell Sci-Fi co-production - a widowed ex-astronaut farmer, his chiseled jaw, a feisty daughter, a crusty grandpa, a dying Earth, dust storms, paranormal activity, baseball, cornfields - and lots of corn.After about an hour - which seems like two - a valiant crew lifts off in search of a planet to save humanity. Once they've journeyed through an intergalactic wormhole, the implausibility dimension expands to cosmic levels. Scientific hocus-pocus is stirred into the sentimental sludge as gigantic tsunamis, deranged astronauts, spaceship chases, time travel tomfoolery and black hole baloney eventually lead to a schmaltzy Hallmark-style climax. The visual effects are above average, but far short of awesome. When all is said and done, the film's self-importance and mawkishness leave one rooting for humanity's extinction."
195," Talk about over-hyped
","My girlfriend and I decided to watch this movie at home as we missed it when it was doing the rounds in our local cinema. How glad we were, for at least it meant we were able to sip on our wine and chat in between - which we would have not been able to do had we watched in the cinema. And we did a LOT of chatting, mostly about the direness of the film itself. I can't believe so many reviewers thought this film to be amazing (but then we're all entitled to our opinions - and we all know how opinions differ to the extremes at times). However, I honestly couldn't connect with ANY of the characters in this film - particularly the leads. I really have no words...just found the whole film totally ridiculous - and don't even get me started on Hans Zimmer's background music!!! We needed subtitles for some scenes as the music was so overpowering we couldn't hear a word that was being said. I was even so bored at one point that I started to imitate Matthew McConaughey's irritating 'whistle' as he speaks. Enough said methinks."
196," The Emperor's New Clothes
","I sent to see Interstellar on Saturday night and have just spent 45 incredulous minutes reading the reviews. The film I went to see was dull, preposterous and far far far too long. Let's start with the idea. A good one but poorly displayed. I wanted to know more about how humanity was destroying the planet. All I got was old folk I am guessing talking about the duststorms of the 1920's and 1930's? Perhaps they were attempting to lay the foundation for the whole premise of the film? I also wanted to know more about Cooper but we didn't really see how he became a farmer other than the flashback at the start. When did his wife die? Why is his father in law living with him? Did we really get to understand the relevance of the droid they chased in the truck? Unfortunately most of the film is taken up with barely audible dialogue about scientific hypothesis and personal issues intertwined together. This made it very difficult to follow and the interest wanes as a result. BUT the biggest downfall of the film is Matt Damon. I am a fan off his but not in this. He is dreadfully miscast as the villain of the piece of sorts and that whole fight with Cooper and Ryan is poor. It is just not convincing at all and there is no suspense involved in the whole docking scene at all. Cooper just tells him not to dock as he hasn't got the codes but you never felt Ryan was in jeopardy. It was so poorly constructed. Overall vey similar to Inception in that it is at times visually stunning but rather like Inception it is style over substance. Beautiful to look at but like opening a strawberry cream in a box of Quality Street - very disappointing. And the title of my review? I am just a bit fed up that Nolan has made some fine early films and now nobody will criticise him? In The Emperors New Clothes nobody tells the Emperor he is wearing nothing until a little boy informs him. Somebody needs to tell Nolan that he needs to get back to crafting films full of suspense and not a plodding sci-fi full of characters you barely care about."
197," Awful movie. Disappointing
","It's a shame that people are rating this movie so high. I registered just to put some sense into IMDb. I actually don't believe in the ratings of this site anymore. Possible explanation for a high rating is that people are paid to rate the movie or most people think they are geniuses if they tell their friends that they love a sci-fi mind-blowing movie even though that movie actually doesn't make sense. I love Nolan but he dropped the ball on this one. This has potential but he created a mess out of it. A lot of scientific inconsistencies, useless characters, messy plots. One of the most overrated films ever. Let's bring back some credibility in this site"
198," Very disappointing
","I am really amazed at the good reviews this is getting on here, as I found it a huge disappointment. Absolutely nothing about it makes any sense; in fact no single moment in the film follows logically from anything that was happening 15 minutes earlier. The ""science"" is ridiculous: a six-inch deep ocean with 200-foot waves is one of the more believable elements. The motivation of the characters changes from minute to minute, and they seem bound and determined to make the worst choice whenever faced with a decision. The special effects are unimaginative; Kubrick did it all better, without CGI, 50 years ago. The bombastic music's only virtue is that it drowns out the ludicrous dialogue. And the final resolution of the central mystery is utterly nonsensical; involving manually transmitting what must be many, many gigabytes of data in Morse code via the second hand of an old wristwatch. WT*? Definitely NOT recommended."
199," Watched one hour and gave up
",Watched 2001 space od. instead. How can this film get a higher score on IMDb than a classic proper sci film and not some family drama stretched out and a bit of futuristic spice?I can only think this gets such a high rating due to viewers not seeing old films and being won over by modern day bandwagons to jump on.Also the lead character is so wooden. He acts like a 2 by 4. And he mumbles his stiffly delivered bits. This would not matter in a proper sci-fi film but here in this melodrama masquerade it does matter.Or really it doesn't matter. This is over rated tripe.
200," In Space No One Can Hear You Yawn
","Originality: This movie was completely original, in the exact same way that the Hunger Games was, that is, not at all. The Hunger Games is to Battle Royale as Interstellar is to 2001: A Space Odyssey, that is, a complete rip off. Many reviews are saying how original it is, I expect these people haven't seen 2001.Score: A few people have drawn parallels with Contact, saying that the movie reminds them of Contact. Perhaps it is the pulsating metallic base throbbing noise that Interstellar ripped off?Millennium Falcon: When our heroes first take off from Earth they do so in a Saturn V type moon rocket, with the exhausted stages falling away behind them. Yet, when they later take off from the extra-solar planets, one with 130% gravity no less, they do so in the conventional Millennium Falcon kind of sci-fi way. It huts my eyes!Southern Drawl: Our hero seemed to of had a stroke for the first half of the movie and had slurry half-awake speech, yet later seemed to recover. Perhaps that's what time-dilation does for you!The Robot: Seriously? I think it was so big and square because it contained two CRT-monitors. If you asked a 10yr old to draw a robot design that would be useful on a space mission, then it would undoubtedly improve on the one in Interstellar. But my biggest gripe was, how did it walk? We have two legs(!), our trailing leg doesn't catch on the floor as it swings forwards as our foot extends, lifting us slightly. The robot in Interstellar walks like a pair of chopsticks (but without the accompanying side to side wobble that would be necessary if you chose such an impractical design).Newton's 3rd Law: Stated correctly, applied incorrectly. If our heroes' spaceship had been launched backwards like a bullet from a gun, then it would have been a cool quip, instead it made him look like an idiot corn farmer.The Best of the Best: Why! Why is Hollywood obsessed with the hero being the best of the best of the best? Couldn't he just have been one of the remaining pilots of average competence? (with a genius daughter and an idiot son).Frozen Yoghurt: At one point the Millennium Falcon Space Shuttle hits a cloud made of frozen yogurt (or was it ice?), so, a cloud hanging in the air made of strawberry yogurt, sounds a bit silly. Presumably, as with Arthur Dent's cup, it was held up by art?Emotional: But not a black hole. Possibly the best element of the movie. The human element, and the pain of loss and separation was, strangely, conveyed extremely well.A real Black Hole: Well, I wish I had one so I could get the 3 hours back that I lost watching this. It's not all bad, some bits are compelling, but mostly it's a boring re-skin of 2001."
201," What did I just watch?
","As others have done, I'm giving this a 1 to counter at least one absurd 10 given somewhere out there from behind a bookshelf in the fifth dimension. I won't go into the plot here, there are thousands of other reviews that have done so, I'm simply going to comment on why this movie is so not a 10 star flick. Other than Christopher Nolan stalkers loving from afar, this movie is a 3 hour exercise in endurance. Once I start to watch a movie, even for all of the faults I may find, I typically watch to the end...only with Interstellar it just wouldn't end. It was torture. I'm a huge believer that sci-fi movies are fantasy, an escape from the every day, a time to allow the improbable to take over...but they still have to make sense. The disconnect from scientific theory in this movie is of epic proportions. For example, I couldn't get over the complete avoidance of event horizon as the film wrapped up. I found myself completely irritated by this because the film relied so much on general relativity to develop the story line, and then just bastardized the entire premise of the theory so that the main character could survive was a total rip off. The acting was so over the top it was, at times, comedic. The character development was so poor that, as an example, I have no idea what Topher Grace's role even was, I was just like, ""hey, Topher Grace is in this movie""? Given the fact that the viewer was offered the opportunity to visit a different GALAXY, it was a total snoozer to see that all that is out there is Waterworld, Iceland and the Grand Canyon. I could go on, but I won't. I've lost enough time in my life to this awful film."
202," i want my two hours of my life back, what kind of crap was this, so stupid
","omg this movie was so stupid, like really, waist of time,i even pulled out my cell phone and browsed fb while it was playing because of how stupid this movie was. The music at some parts was just so way over kill, too loud and too way dramatic. The whole story was crap and did not make any logical sense, so ur telling us that NASA did not know that the best pilot to fly the space ship was living only about a car drive away from ur secret hiding base? u did build a space ship to fly out but cant have mri machines anymore? a drone was flying for 10 years and no one saw it or knew about it? wtf, its like the person who wrote this movie was like thinking we are all so stupid and wont understand who this movie is not making any seance. OK the only part i did like about the movie was when they found the bad guy who try to kill the main character, that was something interesting, and his trying to dock into the space station, it was nice story but still none nonsensical. bc with time, it just don't make any sense, so they 2 walk away from the space ship and then when he called the space ship to rescue him u can see they fly so far, no way they could of walk that distance, then at the same time they rescue the good guy via plane, the bad guy can walk all the way back to another plane? while a 3rd one get blown up???wtf and also how many shipped did they send anyways, it just did not make any sense to me this movie. its just way too stupid. sorry, but it was.i want my money back!"
203," Ho Hum
","This movie is everything I expected it not to be. It was dramatic, but not in a good way. Over dramatic. Far, far too predictable, too Hollywood and anything, and I mean anything but scientific. I'm just going to ask this once - Chris,have you ever actually read any Stephen Hawking? Because then maybe the story line could have taken a turn toward science instead of fairy tale, Hollywood pump up the revenue box office production. Maybe someone on your crew could have consulted with Hawking and came up with an alternate ending. One where people who enter black holes get broken up into their atomic parts such as happens to even light. Instead of some fantasy land Disney ride. Wow what garbage.The trailer in this movie made it look like an amazing adventure in deep space. And yes, don't get me wrong there is space, and a few time deadlines to add in some much needed suspense after one too many porch scenes with Grandpa drinking beer while tending the corn fields. However, what this movie lacked was a sense of logic. I mean really. Flat out.The blight that is taking down the humans seems to be completely overlooked in the movie. There really is no information on it except, our atmosphere has a lot of nitrogen in it which is feeding the blight. ""huh?"" The earth is written off in this movie because of blight? This earth has survived, earthquakes, giant meteorites, plagues, famines, flooding and we are done in by a blight?Fine, we can't feed people so we are headed for the stars, all covertly of course. And our hero just happens to stumble upon NASA. Which wants him to be the pilot, even though he's a reluctant farmer, who was a pilot - because as a pilot he's the best of the best with honors. The script felt like something I would read in an old spaghetti western Clint Eastwood movie. I feel like I threw money away on a cheap plot based on oversimplification of scientific notions and box office greed. And the end: omg it's ""time,"" no, no it's ""gravity,"" no it's time. Just stop. And our protagonist surviving a black hole. What? Because it's not a black hole? Human's built it? Future humans. Probably the one's from Futurama. OK I've seen enough roll credits. However, that said, if you want some good sound, yes the sound was good. Good visuals, nothing gravity didn't do better, and descent acting, almost like Armageddon, yah know, the Bruce Willis stuff. Then indeed this is your movie. Trust me, this is no Inception. If you go, enjoy, just don't go in with high expectations (9.1 on IMDb? really?)or you'll be let down.Oh and the 2001 monolith robots were the highlight of the movie for me. They were good for a couple of laughs. Have a good one."
204," The lonely cow-boy saves the world once again.
","Yeah, that's about it. More using his balls than his brains, the lonely cow-boy finds his true mission, struggle and win against all enemies, even taming the black hole, saves the world and in the end leaves in the sunset to go back to the woman who's eagerly waiting for him.People dare comparing this to ""2001""? Yeah, it's long, like 2001, and spacey. But where 2001 is all in allusion and mystery, this movie explains laboriously again and again what's happening, just in case.Most scenes are long. So long. The ships try docking and fail, again, and again, for long, long minutes. Stranded in inhospitable landscapes, they escape repeatedly each danger from the unknown (the huge wave, the slippery ice, the toxic atmosphere), so that even the most inattentive spectator gets it.The acting is good, and images beautiful, therefore it deserves 3."
205," Why oh why did I not listen to reason?
","Was almost not going to give this movie a pass, having a feeling that it was going to be a bloated mess.And oh my what a bloated, drawn out, rudderless and boring bloated mess it was!I have never felt like walking out of the cinema while watching a movie but at the half way point of this film i was tempted, it was that bad.The story was a meandering affair not really going anywhere from start to finish with nonsensical and cliché dross thrown in for good measure.It didn't feel like a sci-fi, more like a soppy drama with a few sci-fi elements thrown in and the special FX where nothing special, a few OK scenes but for the most part it was bland bland bland.I thought it was going to be an innovative, trippy Kubrikesque like film with a lot of bizarre and amazing visuals and strange and unique vistas and scenes, aliens, strange technologies, Otherwordly Gods!Instead it boiled down to a silly soap opera with bickering astronauts and crying family members. Avoid."
206," Much Ado about Not Much
","First, I did NOT see this in IMAX.If the director's goal was to make us (me, at least) feel ignorant because all the mumbo-jumbo is over our heads, he succeeded. Visually, it's pretty good, but not nearly as good as last year's ""Gravity"" and tries to duplicate the emotions of that movie, unsuccessfully.The movie is way too long and overwrought. The acting is good, but the storyline is so convoluted that you don't really care about most of the characters.And of course (SPOILER!), the Black guy has to die.This might be worth seeing in an IMAX theater, if your ticket is discounted--otherwise wait for Netflix."
207," Nothing i can say does justice.
",The Nolan brothers have made a piece of history. That's all i can say to help you understand how extremely well done this movie is.
208," You either love it or hate it.
","This is the first film with several flaws that I still rate a 10. Strictly scientifically speaking, it bends or breaks several laws of physics. So if you are a stickler for scientific accuracy, this ain't your movie. But, if you can look past the physics, you are in for a magical adventure. Otherwise get you some Jane Austen and call it a day."
209," one of the best movies in the history of cinema (9.6)
","A great movie that I watched many times, should definitely be among the best movies of all time. It is one of the five best films for me.
It's really hard to understand Nolan's mind and I watched the movie with my mouth open.It's amazing to convey space, planets, gravity, everything like this. There is a lot of emotion in the science fiction movie, and you definitely cry at the end of the movie. Simply awesome."
210," It's a masterpiece
","This film is by far one of the best movies I have ever seen. The visual effects are out of this world. Nolan delivered a movie that can only be fully understood when you watch it multiple times. The story is quite scientific yet very emotional.
Hans Zimmer delivered by far the best work of his career with this mesmerizing soundtrack. A shame that he didn't get an Oscar for this.
All in all it's still impossible to describe it properly, you just have to experience this masterpiece by yourself. When a movie deserves a 10/10 then it's this one."

This Sci-fi movie had everything I want and more in a movie.... action, love, intelligence, A-Class acting and space exploration. I adore every part of this film and the AI robots that follow the characters about in the film add a wonderful touch.This movie blew my mind back then and it still does now."

","Rarely do I ever find a movie that I can watch countless times yet every time, it feels like I'm watching it for the very first time. Although most of Christopher Nolan's movies are like that, this one goes above and beyond. The acting is just so pure and beautiful. Hans Zimmer wrote some of the most amazing soundscores in movie history. As for storyline and plot, simply breathtaking. Bravo."

219," A true master piece
","Nolan not only brought me to tears with this title but made me fall in love with the story and historic placement,"
220," Unprecedented!
","You know, sometimes when you watch a movie for the first time and then 5 or 10 years later you rewatch it, it's not all that good or amazing how you thought it was the first time you watched it. And honestly that is something normal to every human being. We're all in a process in our lives and we change every minute of our lives. But every now and then comes a movie that strikes you so hard the first time around and then the more you watch it, the more you realize just how good it is. That's the case for me with Interstellar. A movie that I adored ever since I watched it the first and second time in theater. A movie that inspired me, a movie that I quote sometimes and a movie that simply put just leaves you wondering about the vastness of space and what could lie for us out there in the sky. Never did I had that feeling of wonder and amazement at space and at what could be out there like I did watching this movie. So, what makes Interstellar such a compelling and amazing movie for me?Plot Analisys:So, the movie kicks off with Cooper, our main protagonist who has a dream about once flying a NASA aircraft. Then he goes and steals a indian drone while driving his car with his son and daugther. And what I love about this scene is that it sets so expertly the tone of the movie, that humanity or anyone for that matter has to leave something behind in order to go forward. And that's a pretty nice life lesson right there. Then he goes to talk to Tom and Murphy's teachers and the feeling I got there was that this movie accurately predicts the state of the world in the future. The teachers apparently try to controll who their scholars will become and wipe the past by replacing it with stuff that actually are more accurate. Anything sounds familiar about that? This is a world that forgot what it was, forgot sacrifices achieved for humanity. It's a great touch from Nolan suggesting that our society is basically just obsessed about the future and forgets and ignores the past. On the polar oposite are the simple farmers that just try to earn a living from harvesting crop. A world of two polar oposites, perfectly portrayed through a couple of scenes of dialogue. So, when Coop gets back home he discovers an anomaly which he fixes but later happens again and this time is in Murphy's room where dust falls only in certain shapes. It's some kind of a gravitational anomaly. So the message in the anomaly is the cordinates to a place. So when Coop and Murphy, who sneaks into his car, go there they find that it's NASA, or what it remained of it. There they meet Dr. Brand and his daughter Amelia. So Coop gets recruited into piloting a sapce shuttle for a mission of saving humanity by going through a wormhole into another galaxy and finding a suitable planet for humanity. So when they get back home Murphy is angry at Cooper and the scene in which they both say goodbyes it's absolutely heartbreaking. Fantastical acting from both Mackenzie Foy and Matthew McConaughey. So, he leaves with his truck checking his front right seat to see if Murph didn't hide there again. Man, what a legendary scene! So the crew of Cooper, Brand, Doyle and Romilly leave to go to Saturn where the wormhole is. During this time there are some scenes of the crew talking to the people of NASA and to their families back home, and although the pacing is a little bit slow here, the character moments are absolutely necessary here. Eventually they go through the wormhole and get to the other galaxy where there's a black hole and three planets orbiting it. So, they go to the first one (Miller's) which is all covered in water but the water is like maximum of 1 feet high. What could this mean? Forgot to mention that the proximity to the black hole makes time slow down to the point in which 7 years pass on earth for an hour on that planet. Well it turns out the planet has huge waves caused by the gravitational pull to the black hole and the scene spent on this planet is absolutely breathtaking. The flawless CGI, the music and the suspence, it's just a masterclass in making suspencefull scene. Then they come back to the space station Endurance where Romilly waited 23 years for them. Interesting to mention is that if you go and listen to the soundtrack ""They're not Mountains"" every tick of the watch in that track means an hour on earth. I mean, it can't get more genius than that now can it? So they decide to go to Dr. Mann's planet next having found out that Amelia is in love with the astronaut named Edmund who is on the third planet. Here we find out more about Brand's feelings for Edmund and that, as she says, is a proof of a higher plane of existance, a proof we cannot understand nor can we understand that higher existance. I mean, how much more can a movie inspire it's audiences than right here? I like to think this is a reference to divinity and how love for us humans might be a proof of that divinity. So after rationally discusing the situation the crew decides to go to Mann's planet. I'd like to point out that these are genuinely some of the most clever and rational characters I've seen in a main stream movie. They always think before acting, they talk through the next steps and they take mostly rational decisions all the time. Yet, the circumstances are almost always against them. And that's a neat message to the audiences because just like in real life, you could take the best decisions, think everything rationally through and still have certain circumstances stand against you. That's part of our growth as persons and human beings. So they go, and awake Mann from hibernation, but then he tries to maroon them there in order to finish the mission and carry out plan B, because plan A was never an option, said Dr. Brand before dying. Turns out he never did finished the equation that would allow humans to manipulate gravity in order to execute a massive evacuation from Earth. So plan B is all that is left. So Mann tries to get to Endurance but he gets blown into space by an imperfect contact. Then one of the best scenes in the movie and one of the best scenes ever happens as Cooper tries to reconect his shuttle to Endurance. He does but in doing so Endurance is now heading towards Gargantua. See how the movie continually pushes it's characters in stressful and difficult situations even though they almost always make the right decisions. That creates real tension and an uncertainty of what's gonna happen next. Can't praise the movie more for that! So they detach two shuttels and escape Gargantua but Cooper decides to get into one shuttle and go into the black hole. There he ends up in a tesseract where he sees every moment of his daughter's life in her bedroom. There is revealed that the ghost from the begining was Cooper all along. And even though that is not hard to figure out early in the movie, the execution is what stands out for me here. It's the emotional connection between characters that make this scene in the tesseract and the reveal all the more powerfull. So while Cooper was in the tesseract one of his robots also went through the black hole and discovered the solution to the gravitation equation. And then Cooper sends that information to Murph via morse code. After doing that he wakes up near Saturn and is brought onto a space station made with the efforts of Murph, and he gets to see her in her last moments as an old lady. And that scene is heartbreaking and tear jearking. And the movie ends suggesting Cooper goes to Edmund's planet to help Brand start the human colony there. And that's it, that's the wonderful plot for Interstellar.End of Plot AnalysisYou know, the thing I like the most about this movie is, well, everything. From the indescribable wonderful music, to the fantastic CGI combined with practical effects, to the dramatic performances from the both leads of this movie especially McConaughey, to the engaging story and the surprinsing twists, this movie is a phenomenon that rarely happens in Hollywood and a future classic for sure. Starting with the music, this is probably Hans Zimmer's best score. The music stirs a sense of wonder and awe about what could be out there in space. It's engaging when it has to, dramatic when there's the case for that and quiet and sentimental when characters go through tough sepparations or emotional reunions. The special and practical effects combine seamlessly and is good to see that instead of overused like in the more contemporary movies. Then the performances. Matthew McConaughey gives one of his best performances, ranging from calmness to rage to crying and laughter all done without a hint of overacting or exagerating. Anne Hattaway starts off as a solid scientist who is cold and calculated, but as things start to derail she starts to show a more human, emotional side, culminating in her feelings for Edmund sealing the decision to go to Mann's planet instead. This movie also has such a comeplling story that is hard even for someone who doesn't understands the physical concepts this movie poses, to not enjoy the movie for what it is: a story about the realtionship between a dad and his daughter. The only gripe would be that the movie doesn't fully explain the importance of the gravity equation for the evacuation of the human race. Speaking of it, even the humans as a race have a character arc in this movie. They start as a race dying and achieve the first step in human trancendence, in that they harness gravity and manipulate it. Ultimately Interstellar is a phenomenon, a movie that is set to become a future classic and a movie the likes of which is unlikely to get made in the society we live in right now. A movie that belongs to a different age in cinema, an age in which characters had arcs, stories were simple and compelling and the plots were complex and engaging. Truly one of the if not the best movie ever made in my opinion! 10/10"
221," My favorite movie of all time.
","I had a special interest in science since my childhood. I tried to read all the sci-fi related books. During the shutdown, I watched a lot of movies as well as a lot of documentaries on science. When I heard that my favorite director Christopher Nolan directed a movie in astrophysics, I was shocked. I watched it as soon as possible. Honestly, I will not skimp on rating 10/10 in each of Direction-Acting-Score-Cinematography. Moreover, it is only possible for Nolan to get impossible details in the necessary places, accuracy as well as not to drag complex science in unnecessary places or take the help of fiction in the interest of the movie. I missed some key points without seeing the problem of sound mixing and without subtitles for which I see it again in print the next day, seeing it properly, I realized that Nolan has created a masterpiece!It will be more enjoyable to watch the movie as a drama without trying to understand it as sci-fi. Because human emotion has been given priority in many cases here. Even in some cases Nolan has ignored science in the interests of the drummer. So in the end Interstellar is more of a drama than a sci-fi, which conveys a more beautiful message about love than many romantic movies. Of all the powerful dialogues in the whole movie, this one seems to me to be the best.Not to mention the soundtrack of the movie. Some music plays with people's emotions, at the same time can bring different kinds of feelings, can put pressure on the nerves. One such score is Interstellar music by Oscar-winning composer Hans Zimmer, who has previously worked with Nolan on Inception, The Dark Knight, and you must remember what a terribly beautiful creation the music track was.Interstellar's cast made me even more excited about it. While immersed in the true character of True Detective, Matthew appeared in the role of Cooper, along with one of my favorites, Anne Hathaway and Mackenzie Foy, but even if you haven't seen Mackenzie Foy before, you can imagine that this box of cuteness will grow into another Jessica Chastain!It also seems wrong to expect Nolan's movie to be simple linear. Interstellar seems to me parallel non-linear (although I doubt if there is anything with this name). Something happens before, and some happens at the same time. An attempt was made to describe the incident linearly.People reach a stage where they have to be developed from 4 dimensional being to 5 dimensional being. 5D sees time as a dimension so they can navigate at any time. These 5 dimensional human beings are THEY!But time is also a physical dimension for 5D. It's like you can see all the events laid out in front of you, you can see your birth, your school life, your marriage, your death ...As long as humans are 5D, the earth is destroyed, so they are located in another galaxy. But if they come to this other galaxy, it will take a way that was not discovered until the earth was destroyed.Wormholes are a type of quantum anomaly. At the quantum level, it is seen that electrons can move from one place to another without passing any time. This concept is called wormhole. If the wormhole could be created in the form of a mass, it would be possible to pass two light-years apart almost any time apart.It is not possible to create wormholes naturally due to the huge amount of energy and dark energy required to keep them warm and stable. But 5D people have found a way to stabilize wormholes. This time they created a wormhole and placed one end of the wormhole near Saturn in our solar system, the other end in the galaxy where future humans will be.So this time we need to transfer the people of the world to a new place. For this they choose Murph K. Murphy's father, Cooper, is a NASA engineer and pilot, and Murphy is exceptionally intelligent.From Morph's bookshelf comes the Morse code signal 'STAY' which is sent by Murphy's father Cooper, a 5D Tesseract created by Future 5D Human. Because the first time Cooper enters Tesseract, he thinks he's stuck here forever, and nothing would have happened if Past Cooper hadn't been on this mission. Then Cooper realizes the power of Tessaract. Tessaradact is a 5D model, so he can navigate at any time. Grace received the necessary information about the singularity for the Gravity Equation Solve from Tarsus Black Hole, which he was converting to Cooper for Morse and sending to Cooper Murph controlling the second hand of the clock.If space-time is continuous multiverse we can never see another universe but gravitational pull. That's why Cooper uses Gravity for contact.Data from Singularity from Murph Cooper and data from Romley's Black Hole all solve the Gravity Equation, which was started by Professor Brand. It is through the gravity equation that the massive Cooper station and the people of the world begin their journey from the earth to the human new home to use gravity.Meanwhile, as soon as Cooper Murphy finishes sending all the info needed for gravity equation, the purpose of the Tesseract is fulfilled, and the 5D closes the Tesseract and sends Cooper and Tarsus back to Saturn with a wormhole. ('The first handshake as Cooper crosses the wormhole)The Rangers found and rescued Cooper as he passed Saturn at Marfra Cooper Station.Suffice it to say, wormholes are so far only possible at the quantum level. Although the black hole was discovered, no information was found inside its event horizon. The tesseract part of the ending is completely fiction, even if it doesn't say May be 5 dimensions so far only in theory. String theory also speaks of 9 dimensions. But so far nothing has been scientifically proven. Maybe 'they' will answer these questions."
222," Masterpiece 👍🏽
","It was a masterpiece at large. My friend told me about it that year but I wasn't really up about It. I'm glad I finally saw it. The imagination, the idea was top notch."
223," Reach for the stars
","Mindblowing ! My go to movie, it may have even pipped my all time favourite to the post which is One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest.The musical score is stunning, the cinematography is spellbinding and the who concept it beautiful. The more times you watch it the deeper you get pulled in just like Gargantua.This movie is very special to me. I love it"
224," Christopher Nolan's Magnum Opus
","Interstellar is the most powerful movie I have ever watched before. This experience is what should define the blockbuster entirely. A brand new idea that challenges the viewer to think, performances that can drive you to tears, editing that feels out of this world, and above all else, a music score that is endlessly watchable that perfectly captures every moment. The drama of this film does not come from a central antagonist, per se (although Matt Damon makes a brilliant villain while he is on screen), but instead, from the simple concept of time.The writing of this whole film pairs with the beautiful graphics to seem extremely scientific, and I would not be surprised if these events could actually happen. So many of the scenes are masterfully laid out, and can be so dramatic. One of the best scenes is when Cooper is leaving, and Murph runs to her father, crying, only to find that he's not staying for her, even after she told him to go. This film is even more powerful later on, when we find out that the person knocking the books off of the shelf, telling him to ""stay"", was actually Cooper, in the future. As the music builds, Cooper is shouting and crying because he knows that this moment could have been prevented, and he would have seen his daughter grow up, but now he will never be able to do that.This is a story about a man who sacrifices everything in his life, for everybody else's life. Learning that the mission was never supposed to succeed is a genuinely fascinating twist, and watching the betrayal on Murph's face as she finds this out is yet another brilliant scene. Matthew McConaughey is so unbelievably perfect in this film, and he seems so genuine of a person that it's hard not to feel bad for him. Every other performance in this music is so unbelievably good, even down to the minor characters. The twists in this movie are beautifully done, and make the movie shine as bright as it possibly could.What absolutely sells the experience is the beautiful sound track by Hans Zimmer. Every piece of music is intense, tear-jerking, and unequivocally beautiful. This movie is an absolute gem and deserves many rewatches. How on earth this film was not even nominated at the academy awards is absolutely beyond me. This is the greatest science fiction movie I have ever seen in my life, and this is certainly Christopher Nolan's Magnum Opus."
225," An absolute science fiction masterpiece.
","This is not a simple science fiction movie. It puts the power of love and human emotions into the context. Relativity does not only regard space and time. If you still did not watch this, even if you are not a fan of science fiction, do it. You'll be glad you did. Have fun and enjoy your life!"
226," One of my favorite movies about space
","This film here made three hours feel like a walk in the park by the amount of attention it I gave to it. From the opening scene to the credits, my full attention was on the screen."
227," Not only mind-blowing, but mind-bending!
","This is one the most beautiful, emotional and mind-bending movies I have ever seen."
228," Ahead of time!
","Christopher Nolan made a breathtaking masterpiece which talks about the future, where hope and love help to the survival of human species. But, somehow it's an over ambitious one, a bit further from imagination.And may be it's the beauty of intellectual provision."
229," This movie deserve Oscars
","It is an amazing, Brilliant Sci-Fi Concept with cute family story. I never given 0 stars to any movies. This is my First 10star movie."
230," Absolute Masterpiece.
","It took me 6 years to finally catch this one, but what a grand movie it is.
The cast is second to none, as are their performances, the cinematography is superb, the storyline is complex yet clearly exposed... There are a couple of slower moments, but no dragging moments, the score by Hans Zimmer is probably one of his best ones of all time. It takes you on a journey, deals with issues we can clearly envision as part of our potential future, explores philosophical concepts but never stops becoming an incredible entertainment piece. 100% recommended... if you like movies that challenge you at least a little bit. I can see this being a little too involved and demanding for some folks, but those who get it are in for a top level experience."
231," Glad i didn't watch the trailer
","I was extremely lucky to get the chance to see this film upon its first day release, before entering the cinema, my expectations were already high, after all, this was a film from the cinematic genius who brought us the likes of 'Inception' and 'The Dark Knight', to summarise the following review in a single sentence: I left the cinema in extreme awe from the visual masterpiece I had just viewed. A film that explores the psychological and emotional state of a man whose life revolves around his family, 'Interstellar' is a thrilling and thought-provoking film that boasts an intellectual story masterfully written by the Nolan brothers. Whilst there seems to have been influence from films like '2001: A Space Odyssey' and 'Apollo 13', 'Interstellar' is unique in its own way. Whilst the subject may be hard to comprehend at times, it can't be denied how visually monumental and thoughtful Christopher Nolan's epic science fiction masterpiece is, and can easily be named the best film of this year and possibly one of the greatest science fiction films to have ever graced the screen. A sheer brilliant feat of cinema.Nolan's masterpiece, one of the best sci-fi movie"
232," Great Movie!!
",A great movie with great acting from everybody and my favourite soundtrack of all time.
233," WOW
","An amazing move! It's definitely in top five!
The plot is intricate and very enjoyable.
The acting is quite good but not remarkable, but the story gets over it and you'll not notice it.
Well, there is a oversight but it doesn't bother (family truck).P.S. If you are searching for a movie with a light plot that does not request attention and with short length this will be definitely NOT the movie you are seeking for. Nolan's works require attention and some mental effort to comprehend them at all (and I love them for it)."
234," Everyone should watch this peice of art
","I regret that I did not see this masterpiece in its time, especially this movie which I enjoyed in all respects, the greatest soundtrack, The interconnected events are insane, the creative representation of all the actors from young to old, the manipulation of time is one of the great things in this movie, finally the ending I did not like it. Because it is unreasonable"
235," The best movie I have ever seen!
","Interstellar is a work of art, without exaggeration! Thanks in advance to Cristopher Nolan for this film! It is a film full of emotion, surprise and rationality! It is an example of overcoming and devotion to the survival of human life. It is a complete complete film at all levels, made even more incredible by the soundtrack made by the legendary Hans Zimmer. All the actors were phenomenal in their work! It is, without a doubt, the best film I have ever seen in my life. It was a crime to have been a film ignored by the Oscars!"
236," The best movie I have ever watched
",There are no words to describe this masterpiece. I just remember back in 2014 having watched it 7 times at cinema! I wanted to enjoy every moment Interstellar was running.
237," Finally, I found the answer 🙂
","Well, I will be very brief. I found the answer of one of the most difficult questions: ""What is your favourite movie?"" For me it was one of the toughest questions 'coz there was a time I watched like 100 movies on an average per month. And I'm so glad to finally find the answer and thanks Mr. Nolan for that. I can easily give 10 stars to the movie only for introducing me to the concept of five dimensions. For other aspects of the movie, I wish I could give the movie a 11 or 12 out of 10!"
238," Greatness of the universe
","One of the best (and for me it is the coolest and most inspiring) films about our universe, the power of human aspiration, secrets and family. I reviewed this masterpiece several times and every groove a mean tear flowed down my face. The film is deservedly so high in the ratings. It's a pity that there aren't many such films being made now."
239," Mind Blowing Movie.
","This movie was the best written, acted, visual effected, etc. movie. This movie was the best movie I have ever seen. I am a huge Christopher Nolan fan and this movie was his finest. Matthew McConaughey turned in his best performance of his lifetime. Anne Hathaway was an amazing supporting actress and compared to her performance in Les Miserables, I have no idea how she didn't get an Oscar for this. The visual effects were more than just Oscar worthy. They were pioneering. I have never seen anything like it. One thing I would recommend is having a little previous knowledge about space. Not like Einstein stuff though. I would recommend you see this movie as fast as you can if you are a Nolan fan or not. I give this movie a rating of 97 out of 100"
240," Beautiful and Stunning
","First of all I didn't watch this film in a IMAX Theater but yet I felt the magic of this film.
The Soundtrack deserves an A+ .
Hans Zimmer made something magical in the films soundtrack that just sticks to your head and captures the reality of space.
Christopher Nolan's Direction is fantastic and this movie made me feel in love with him.
The performances are equally stunning and great.
This movie has a certain vibe to it that make it very magical and stunning.
This film was robbed of its Oscar's but I feel happy knowing that people talk about their theories and How beautiful this film is now.
This film was way ahead of its time.
Words cannot describe this film.
Even though many people point out flaws in this film no film is absolutely perfect but this is as close to perfection we can get in my opinion.
Mesmerizing."

","This is a film that deals with cliched issues like Global decimation and overpopulation maybe not today but definitely in the foreseeable future. The space travel is the reason I watched the film. I had to watch this film once when it came out a second time immediately after it dropped on Blu Ray and streaming services and I still want to watch it a 3rd and 4th time just to experience the wonderful acting, cinematography and visuals again. Christopher Nolan knocked out of the ballpark definitely not his greatest movie ever but yeah I can see top 5 Inception and Dark Knight are better."
243," another masterpiece by Christopher Nolan
","Interstellar is such a powerful movie, with a powerful story / plot and a powerful drama story.Many people talked about how long the movie is but I didn't mind that at all as long as I don't get bored and I didn't get bored at all. I enjoyed the entire 2h 49m.The first 41 min of the movie were kind of an ''introduction'' and we were getting to know more and more about that journey and what might happen and really loved these 41 min, the movie was building that real slow and gentle without it being boring, it was so good.The story and the script of interstellar were so very beautiful and really well written, felt like the story was so very deep with its meaning and with just everything, I really don't know what else to say.Interstellar's music score was so fantastic, deep and did match with every single scene, It was composed by Hans Zimmer so...what's new, Hans Zimmer always blows our heads.Choosing Mackenzie Foy as the ""young Murph"" and Jessica Chastain as the ""older Murph"" was a very great choice, its like when Mackanzie Foy grows up she'll actually become Jessica Chastain with her attitude and with her look and with just everything. Matthew McConaughey was of course incridble, great acting and he gave us an amazing perfomnace that deserved an Oscar nomination at least. Anne Hathaway wasn't a problem at all, her acting was pretty good but her character was the problem, ""Brand"".
Brand was a weak character, at first I really thought that she'll have a bigger role and specially that she is played by Anne Hathaway, I just didn't feel anything towards that character and felt like she was like any other character in the movie. Michael Caine (plays Professor Brand) was a great choice and his acting was good.The Visual Effects were so mind blowing, I even felt like they were all real and no CGI were used to capture these scenes in space, dafiently deserved an Oscar for that.The Production Design was so very good, wasn't surprised that it was nominated for an Oscar. It was so beautiful. The Costume Designs were okay the only thing that grabbed my attention was Cooper's (played by: Matthew McConaughey) jacket and hair style was pretty cool and did suit him well. I mean the whole movie they go to space so space suits are the only thing they wear so I won't talk about the custom designs.Interstellar is a masterpiece and a movie that I really really enjoyed from beginning to end, hats off to Christopher Nolan and to the whole cast & crew.My rating is: 9.5/10"
244," An Incredible Film
","This movie was of the best movies that I have ever seen.
Interstellar was the most beautiful story about life and the incredible who could be the universe. The actuation of Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, and Michael Cane, it was awesome.
My favorite element about this movie it been the visual effects; it was difficult to make out about the reality of the fiction.
If you like amazing stories, this movie is for you."
245," Incredible
","A sad, but incredible, amazing, wonderful, pioneering, and still very human story taking place across time, dimensions and space.... i love this film."
246," Excellent Movie
","Loved this movie. So so good. Special effects, acting, plot. Was really emotionally invested in it. I only have one gripe really and that is the main character's relationship with his son. He was so into his daughter but the son barely got a hug. Made me a bit mad. A minor gripe though for such a cool movie."
247," I was waiting more...
","I should have loved this movie, I love science fiction and artists.
The performance of the actors is good, direction, photography ...But the main point is that they convey to generic people some concepts about quantum time and so on.I was expecting something really new, not just time travel.
My fault! A big 6 is what it deserves."
248," A Visually Stunning Sci-Fi Film
","Christopher Nolan's Interstellar is not a perfect movie, but it was a very memorable experience watching it the for first time. The visuals in the movie are truly spectacular, mixing CGI and practical effects very well to produce some of the most visually stunning scenes ever put on film. The soundtrack from Hans Zimmer is memorable and definitely one of his best scores. All of the performances from the cast are great as well.The first two acts of Interstellar are fantastic, but the third act is where some flaws come in to play. Without spoiling anything, I'm just going to say that some of the concepts in the third act just come off as stupid. The script could also use some work. In addition, the film seemed to go on for a little bit too long. The final 10-15 minutes of this film felt unnecessary.Interstellar isn't one of Nolan's best films, and I wouldn't call it a masterpiece, but it's something that I can watch countless times and never get bored of. Despite me having a few issues with the movie, this is a great film that you should check out if you haven't already."
249," Best movie in my life

I'm writing it after seeing this movie for the third time and I feel that I'm ready to say that this it the best sci-fi movie of all time.If cinema is to be included among the arts, then this is a timeless masterpiece to cherish and Nolan is the Michelangelo of this industry. Yes.... I like this movie quite a lot...."

","By this point, Christopher Nolan became synonymous with thought provoking films l...and adding to his well established filmography is this brilliant magnum opus... beautifully concieved by the minds of Chris Nolan, his brother Jonathan Nolan and astrophysicist Kip Thorne, the science portrayed in this film (by this time proven to be plausible) along with the father daughter relationship combines to form a visual spectacle unlike any other... Highly recommend to watch it..."

","If you almost know nothing about space or stars,don't worry. For two reason:
1_this movie explains everything about them and describe what they are.
2_Interstellar doesn't only based on spatial,stars,blackholes,wormholes and the milkway. It actually based on romance and drama genre. It demonstrates distressing relationship between a father and his daughter.
There are some astronauts who want save the world and figure out a new planet for living.
Timeline,story,directing and specially it's music is strength of this movie. As i did , you probably go back and watch it again to discover what happened in the last part of it.
Good luck and definitely see."
256," Breathtaking
","So many feelings throughout this movie...The time concept was especially mind-breaking. Wonderfully written -- and finally not a trace of unnecessary romance to be found!

262," Rage against the dying of the light.
","I find it hard to articulate how powerful this film is and how it effects me. Chris Nolan has set the bar higher than he did on 'Inception'. The story is based on probable science , with help from Kip Thorne. The cast is perfect. Matthew McConaughy as the former pilot and everyman' who is battling a desire to do what he is destined to do . Fly an outerspace mission or stay on a dying world and looking after his kids. Nolan regular Michael Caine , Jessica Chastain , Timothee Chalamet and Anne Hathaway round out the main cast. The surprise packet is young Mackenzie Foy who's daughter /father relationship drives the emotional side of the film. The robot TARS was my favourite character in the film. He was the humour and he shows human quality when all seems lost.
Hans Zimmer's score maybe the best he's EVER done! Pulsating and driving and plays on the heart strings like no other score I can remember.
Through the nearly 3 hours I was on the edge of my seat following the crews every move and all the while following the seemingly doomed mankind on earth. It's hard to go into specific parts of the film without spoilers.
I laughed , Cried and cheered with jubilation throughout. An instant 10/10 that gets better on viewing. I can't stress how much I recommend this film. Drop what you're doing!!"
263," NASA said this is the most realistic deep space travel movie.
","Interstellar is one of those movies you can watch over and over and still get a new appreciation for the film. I love Nolan's films. He is arguably my favorite film writer and director. Even though this is a science fiction movie, it feels very real. Nolan has such a talent for making his films seem real. Deep space Exploration is just around the corner in real life, but Nolan gives us the most realistic look at it in this film. As always, Nolan does an amazing job at putting together a terrific cast, special effects and takes you on the most incredible adventure that is out of this world. Interstellar is one film you have to see, even if you are not a big science fiction fan. The ending is worth the watch."
264," Stellar movie
",The vast amount of space is always been intriguing and waiting to be discovered. This movie dives deep into these ideas and gives a complex and adventurous route through time and space. Open your mind sit back and enjoy a good movie.
265," Nolan will never fail us.
",One of the greatest sci fi films of all time. Christopher Nolan proves that he is a master director with every film including Interstellar.
266," This movie from another world
","Best movie i have ever seen in my life
Acting
Music
Nolan
All things are freaky"
267," Not a big fan of the underlying message
","Love saved the universe.
Love.
I'm fine with the idea of love being a powerful emotion, but as a sci-fi, especially a quite serious one with well-respected scientist as it's scientific advisor, it is quite cringy to have personal love as core of human survival in a cruel universe."
268," Perfect
",The best film I've ever seen in my life. I don't think it would be better.
269," The music alone deserves an Oscar
","I never thought I'd live to see the day when I'd regard another SCI-FI movie higher than I do Aliens. Well that day has come.Despite the glaring flaws in the plot, it's still an amazing movie. The acting from the entire cast is so astonishingly consistent, but Mathew just knocked it right out of the park. Move over Pachino/Deniro, what Mathew accomplished here is beyond pretentious head wiggling and moving your eyes from side-to-side every 3 seconds, it's more than just persona, it's pure and flawless emotion.The music - An equally impressive masterpiece. It transcends the normal boundary of mere storytelling and fiction, it intoxicates you with this feeling that you are connected with the prowess and struggles of man-kinds greatest accomplishments. Intensely powerful, yet extremely divisive in illustrating the gravity of what is happening.So extremely rare that both the movie and the music live up to each other, especially at such a high standard. But this culmination is why I think Interstellar is the best Sci-fi movie ever made. It also ranks quite highly on my list of best movies ever made.Hans Zimmer and Mathew.M both deserve Oscars for this."
270," Very good movie
","I really liked the idea and the plot full of unexpected points and developments. Especially the second half of the movie is really intense of emotions and the final is simply great. I don't give 9 stars because in my opinion the dialogues are not brilliant, like in other Nolan's movies."
271," Great in the first half; less so in the second.
","In the near future, the planet Earth is disintegrating environmentally. A team of astronauts explore outer space to check if there is another planet where Earth's remaining inhabitants can be transported in order to survive.The first half of the film is fascinating. It has great ideas about what the future might be like considering the current levels of greed and over-population. There is also much adventure in the space mission and the right amount of sentiment of a family being separated. Matthew McConaughey shows brilliance and depth in a scene where he quietly shows how much he misses his loved ones. Playing his school-age daughter, Mackenzie Foy is no slouch either.The second half is interesting at best; muddled, too busy and overlong at worst. There is also a major characters whose fate is left unknown to the point of almost being trivialized.The movie is good in many ways but had the potential to be more."
272," Experience of a lifetime
","I'm slowly losing count of how many times I've seen this movie. It was.....filled with pure emotion. It feels real because this could happen to Earth one day, considering we're not making too much progress on protecting it and it might just turn on us one day. The acting is brilliant, the dialogues are well thought through, the visuals are beyond stunning and LOVE GOES ACROSS SPACE AND TIME. There wasn't a time where this movie didn't make me cry. Even if I know what will happen I simply can't help it. It's just one of those movies. It leaves me in a totally another dimension. Even if you don't like sci-fi this movie cannot leave you emotionless. I can confidently say this is my favourite, and I've watched a lot of movies. A masterpiece. Thank you Nolan, thank you for this."
273," Hands down most amazing film I have ever seen at the cinema
","I was blown away by this film, the sound, the music, the experience!! It was amazing but I couldn't recreate it at home, I feel sorry for anyone who didn't see this at the cinema, it was just amazing and spun me right out in such a good way!"
274," Good, but not great
","Well, it did go on too long, but I enjoyed the relationships of the fathers and daughters displayed and the black hole he was experiencing that showed various time lines of his past in a sort of rubix cube overhead shot. It dragged on the one ice planet that makes them age by 7 years every hour. I also didn't think it had an ending. It kind of stopped."
275," A film I wish I loved
","As someone who loves sci fi, esepcially philosophical sci-fi, I was looking forward to interstellar. And for the first half of the movie I was ready to call it a masterpiece. It was engaging and ejoyable on a surface level, but it also had great themes. I can't call the cinematography anything less than perfect, the score less than entrancing and the performances less then great. The writing is scientifically accurate and well defines the Murph family, but everyone else is given typical Nolan characteristics, in that there too serious to have a personality. But that didn't bother me too much. The whole concept of Cooper having to, in a way choose between his family and the whole universe is interesting and explores human natural and love. It's just a shame then that they can't follow this theme through. Then there is one particular scene. I believe it is after they enter the wave planet. Anne Hathaway talks about love, and how it is everything. This speech is my biggest problem with the movie. The film wants to suggest somehow that his love for his family is key to solving the crisis on Earth. This doesn't really make sense and is not deep. The whole love thing being important becomes very prevelant in the film, but I think it isn't deep at all. Love being important can be summarised in a sentence, but the importance of love can be analysed. It isn't. If you don't care about philosophical elements of the film that's fine but the film keeps bringing back to it. I can turn my brain off in a movie, but when you ask me to think and I think what you're saying is stupid, then you have made a mistake. The whole ice planet scene and Matt Damon being introduced is just unneccessary. Yeah, Damon is the opposite to McCaughnehey in terms of ideals, but we don't need a villain. We don't need a fight scene and a villain like him. He's supposed to be a villain that we think is crazy but we ultimately find him to be relatable, however he just comes across as selfish. Wouldn't it be better if say Hathaway was constantly budding heads with Cooper, and then made a rash decision to try to go back to Earth that cost the crew and led to the docking scene? Rather than forced villain that prevents us from thinking and sympathising with his motives we would be able to philosiphise the situation. The ending is what gets me the most. You've probably heard all the criticism. It being a huge Ex-Machina is not my problem (although it is definitely). I think the ending betrays what the movie was building up to. Instead of leading to an answer or something that gives us more clues or ideas, it leads us to a scene that is obviously meant to pointlessly 2001 style enter this new dimension and conclude that love controls and binds everything. How deep. The ending being an ex-machina doesn't bother me for it being a huge coincidence, but it really doesn't make sense to end like this. Although I don't like the time scene, it is a perfect way to end the movie. The audience anticipates an outcome that they think about. They think about the ending which the movie should do, but once we know everything, what do we think about? I think the scene should've ended by showing Cooper reaching out to Murph to tell her to tell him not to go on the mission, and she responds, changing time in a way that is very vague so we don't really get what happens. Human desires could be explored better, but I see them as only partially shown, in a way where I see essays written about them that I feel were evaluated after analysing every scene. If it is shown only a bit then we can't explore it, and as such it can't be as philosophical ad pure sci-fi as say the golden standard 2001. It is enjoyable, but that is all Interstellar will ever be to me. Good but not great."
276," Boring, clichés, plot holes
","Lots of beautiful visuals to look at, but a completely unbelievable story line including just about every cliché you can think of: - Just before the film started, we were talking about how many movies started with a hero that has some kids in a distressed situation as it seems like this is a must nowadays to add emotional depth to the hero. Within minutes, this film starts with the hero whose wife died of cancer so he now has to raise the kids. - A drone from India flies over, hero grabs his laptop and takes over command of the drone in seconds. Sure. - All of this while driving full speed straight through a corn field, without the slightest bump. Sure. - The wind blows some dust into a room. Hero stares at is, understands it is a binary code of the coordinates of a top secret Nasa base. - Upon entering the base, he meets the beautiful and smart daughter of the professor. Of course that becomes the predictable love affair, but of course she is first difficult to get and of course the hero first has to save her life at least once. - They blow up half of their space station with an enormous explosion, but no problem, just continue flying with the other half. - Earth needs to manipulate gravity to save humanity. No problem, just fly through a black hole and you will automatically gain any knowledge needed. - But wait, they still have to transfer that knowledge to Earth. The only way to do that is to have the hands of an old watch sway up and down in a Morse code because that watch has a love connection to hero's daughter. And with love you can do what all your technology cannot. (Here goes all your respect for this film using believable technology.) - After years in space, the hero is saved with just a few minutes oxygen left.Altogether it seems that Nolan fans have pumped up the score of this film far beyond a reasonable score."
277," Intergalactical overrated cliché movie, with excellent graphics.
","Unfortunately, Interstellar in another Sci-Fi movie that failed to make a consistent clever scenario with good scientific related dialogues that make sense and do not try to impress the audience with wambly bubbly magical solutions and unreal metaphysics. The dialogues are stupid as hell, the events are complete unrealistic and unclever (and unoriginal). The idea and the graphic are very good but as I pointed before this movie suffers from the Pop Sci-Fi syndrome plus the need of Hollywood to have a protagonist-hero style-ultra soldier patriot who stupidly takes the solution to himself (like the scene who rides the spaceship without the auto-pilot or the fact the NASA put his hope into a guy who just showed up in his secret door etc...). Everything around Matthew McConaughey it's so boring cliché and shallow for such a budget movie.The 5/10 is a reflection of a nice idea plus the work of the CGI and the physicists who worked to make the simulations for the ultra-realist black holes."
278," It's all to do with space and time.
","Interesting set up introduces us to a disintegrating near-future world. There's an intriguing reference to re-writing history, along the lines of Capricorn 1, where planetary exploration is faked in a film studio. McConaughey is the astronaut turned farmer who takes a circuitous, and somewhat unlikely, route back to being a rocket man. Interstellar tries to get the science right but quantum physics doesn't make for the best dialogue. Neither are helped by dropping the spoken track way down in the sound mix. McConaughey's tendency to speak through gritted teeth doesn't help either. Although it looks great and is often very imaginative, the film takes too much time exploring dead ends and detours. At times, it felt a bit like a very long trailer for a very epic series. And it really does seem very long, without ever settling on a unified theme. The time anomaly aspects were good, but too much time was spent getting there."
279," a bit too US-centric for my taste
","the movie has its good points but I'd have spent a line or two to involve the rest of the world in this global matter. I kept having the feeling that saving the whole world was only up to NASA and USA, while the rest of the world was sitting in the dust waiting for good old America to save them. Then, if the Earth is trying to get rid of humans because of their improvident behavior, what about to stop growing mono-crops and using pesticides and herbicides? If corn is the only cereal left on Earth, eat something else, like wild grass, fruit, roots... but no, everything but don't ask me to drop out of the American way! I rather leave my family behind and face the unknown but don't ask me to give up on my porch-drinking and intensive farming."
280," Messy movie with both stupid and stellar ideas
","Sound - 1/2 - The score is bombastic, and the dialog is occasionally hard to hear. Acting/Characterization - 1/2 - McConaughey has the rebel cowboy act down pat but is a little less credible as a scientifically-minded father. The other characters are undeveloped and exist to represent specific ideas. Script/Writing - 0/2 - The script is a hodgepodge of corny tag lines and poorly executed themes. Visuals - 2/2 - The fate of humanity apparently rests on the colonization of bleak planets in bleak space, but at least there are cool wormholes, black holes, and baseball fields. Concept (Plot/Theme) - 1/2 - Interstellar deserves at least one point for ambition and creativity, but too many questionable plot developments are thrown together, and the film does not seem to commit to any of its ideas or themes, though some, such as time dilation, are certainly fascinating. When not confounded by possible paradoxes or superficial musings on love, one is left to question the viability of an anti-intellectual society portrayed with such unexplained cynicism, as well as the human imperative to survive on other planets when the species is apparently inclined to destroy its own natural habitat.Total Score - 5/10 Gut Feeling - 6/10 - For a film espousing the virtues of love and exploration, Interstellar has little emotional resonance. Plotwise, it's a memorable mess.Final Average - 5.5/10"
281," Depressing but Visually Stunning.
","Interstellar (2014): Dir: Christopher Nolan / Cast: Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, Matt Damon, Michael Caine: The future looks grim with sand storms destroying everything and corn pretty much the only thing growing. As with Inception, Christopher Nolan toys with the theme of time. This time a farmer and pilot, played by Matthew McConaughey leaves his young son and daughter with their grandfather and then leads an expedition to space through a worm hole. This is in hopes of finding planets to colonize on. Unfortunately complication arise when McConaughey discovers that his son and daughter are now grown adults in the span of a few hours that he was on the first planet, surfaced mainly of water. Watching someone be subdued with grieving regret while his children rapidly grow old is very depressing. It lends the idea of valuing time spent with loved ones. McConaughey is caught in such a dilemma and hopes that his daughter is bright enough to figure it all out. Anne Hathaway plays the daughter of the scientist heading the research, and who joins McConaughey on the mission. Jessica Chastain plays the now grown daughter, stubborn, determined, and clever to boot. Matt Damon plays an astronaut revived from hyper sleep on an ice planet with a secret mission of his own. Michael Caine plays the scientist heading the research that might outlive him. This is hardly an uplifting experience but it contains Nolan's signature curiosity of time. Glorious special effects are out of this world creating what science only dreams of. Score: 8 / 10"
282," Interstellar is too long, confusing and has loud music
","This review is negative. Sorry, but as much as I like sci-fi I could not like this movie except for a little. The back and forth scenes between the farm and space and the concept of the black hole is confusing to me and my wife (who is not a fan of sci-fi but watched it with me anyway). The biggest negative is the loudness of the music which over-rode the actors voices so that neither my wife or I could hardly understand what the actors were saying. Matthew McConaughey seems to speak in a whisper anyway. We did like the actors who played in the movie but again the loudness of the music detracted immensely from the enjoyment of seeing it."
283," Underwhelming and at the best okay.
","I went into this film expecting great things, especially with Christopher Nolan's film Inception being one of the best films put to screen in recent years it's just a shame that it felt like someone filmed a glacier. You watch on in awe of the visuals before you and the way it's been filmed draws you into the people there and you wonder what it would be like to see what they did for yourself. However with the lovely scenery and the brilliant score your friend had made for the home movie you forget that it's just a glacier. It may be huge but it's moving really slowly, at at times you feel like you didn't have to actually watch parts of the film because you know you wouldn't miss anything. Then once it finally pushes its way to where it is heading bits of it begin to fall off, the ending is interesting but eventually the initial feeling just melts away into a large pool of cold and clear water.The closest film that I could possibly compare this to is perhaps 2001:A Space Odyssey, but I feel as though I actually got something out of watching 2001, where as with Interstellar it just felt empty. Despite this, I think it's a must watch for fans of space, science, and scale."
284," I never hated such a high rated imdb movie before
","I cant believe I saw the same movie as the other reviewers which gave him a 10 score.
During the whole movie I felt the like they bullshiting me. The plot is completly has no logic and its not intersting at all.
I forced myself to watch it till the end.
I'm so sorry I did.
Soo boooooring.
What a waste of 3 long hours of my life.What a piece of crap!"
285," So, They Could Communicate with the Past, and They Failed to Tell Which Planet?
","I believe this movie should be rated 5-6 stars.
Cooper had the ability to communicate with the past, he just can't tell NASA or his daughter the destination???
If Cooper gave the right information, they could avoid all the death and sacrifice.Mankind from the future could control gravity, and space time, and they failed to gave solution to blight????When Cooper returned to the space station, he could share all his adventure stories, so future generations learnt his adventure, and in time, when they have the scientific ability, they could pass this information to Cooper in the first place or even people from even earlier. It's a paradox.Nolan tried to be scientifically correct. Cooper gave his daughter a mechanical Hamilton watch. I believe everyone knows how a mechanical watch, it is driven by springs and gears. A mechanical watch's movement direction won't be changed permanently by gravity. Gravity would slow down the watch, but when gravitational influence were gone, the movement should go back to normal, so there is no way, Cooper could use gravitational force to ""encode"" a message into the mechanical watch because the hand of the watch wouldn't stay ""jumpy"": moving back and foreth. He would have better luck using gravity to leave message on the floor. The whole ""watch"" narrative was a big mistake.Cooper loved his daughter, okay, but what about the other kid? He acted as if he only had one kid. That's just weird.It is a good movie, black hole, wormhole stuff are easy to understand, but when you really put your brain to it, you see plot holes. Entertaining but this movie is actually quite stupid."
286," Stunningly bad
","This is yet another movie that relies on a soaring soundtrack and pretty visuals to distract you from the fact that it is poorly crafted, with massive plot holes, manipulative story lines that go nowhere and inconsistent, poorly developed characters.It gives us a bunch of garbled scientific babble without explaining what's going on - I guess we are just expected to accept it, even though it makes no sense. If we are to believe ""Coop"" is desperately needed for this mission to save the planet, why is this former engineer and magnificent pilot not working for NASA? Why is he sent to ""discover"" their compound through his daughter, who displays very little sign of brilliance, besides being a handful at school and understanding morse code. We are given the vague notion that sandstorms choke everything but corn for some reason, and even that apparently hardy crop will die off soon - the good people at NASA have one guy working on it, choosing instead to concentrate the planet's most brilliant minds on mastering the galaxy and transporting the race to a brand new planet, conveniently through a wormhole.""Coop"" is apparently brilliant enough to be the only guy who can save the world, yet he needs tje concept of a wormhole explained to him by having another guy poke a hole in a piece of paper - eureka! The whole movie takes place on a shifting foundation of science! No, love! No, supernatural phenomena! And when ""Coop"" is able to find the magic library and use amazing technology to communicate in the wormhole with no means of life support, he uses that amazing technology to send his brilliant daughter a message in morse code. If you're advanced enough to have an AI robot helper that functions inside a wormhole, surely that technology can be more believably deployed to save the world than with a father's supernatural love manifesting in a short message of complicated science delivered through a watch.And at the end, after ""Coop's"" long, improbable, emotional journey to get back to his beloved daughter, he stays with her for all of 30 seconds, not bothering to meet his descendants or inquire about the fate of his son, whom he kind of liked too, I guess. And then he flies off to be with his love Anne Hathaway, even though they showed no apparent signs of romantic connection, and who has apparently been abandoned on a planet by herself, even though the technology existed to rescue her.If only the viewer could master time/space travel to get back nearly three hours of wasted viewing time."
287," This movie is so murky I stopped watching it before the Texican Gomer got shot into outer space. Don't waste your time/money on this silly piece of crap!
","Most of Mathew's movies I've seen and have enjoyed all of them - with the exception of this one. As I stated in my summary, it's a murky movie and I couldn't get into it. I never understood the bit about the Predator Drone. How did Cooper control it with his laptop? Did he make it crash? Who owned the thing? How was he able to extract the black box from the Drone and drive off with it. Why didn't someone come after it/ him? He even loaded the Drone onto the back of his old pickup and took it to school with him. Still - no one came after it or him. Why not? I dislike a movie I cannot understand because it makes me feel foolish - which I don't like - would you? The so-called Major League Baseball Game was also confusing. Was that supposed to be the New York Yankees in the field? Ridiculous - I was disgusted. So I quit watching the silly thing."
288," Bad acting, bad science, bad movie
","The reviews score here made me look forward to watching this movie, but what a disappointment it was. I am seriously wondering what is wrong with today's audience when a movie like this get such good reviews. Maybe its just a wrong idea of science fiction, maybe people label budget fantasy movies ""science fiction"" ? Anyway, lets have a quick look at some of the bad point of this movie. First the lead actor, i don't know how he is perceived in the US but looking with an European view, McConaughey is just plain horrible at acting.He has no facial expressions and talks English with a slow slur that is really annoying, then later on in the movie i see a good actor like Topper Grace and wonder what the casting director thought when she/he hired McConaughey. There is just no emotional connection between him and any of the other characters, even when he cries it feels like someone just drop some Vaseline over his face and he just sits there waiting till its lunch. Again McConaughey should be a car salesman, not an actor.Then there is the pace of this slow moving ""epic"", we spend god knows how many hours in some dust bowl house where people stare outside and drive in pickup trucks with high technology equipment to bring down Indian drones for using their solar panels to probably power an old play station 3. I kid you not.The way the lead manages to find the secret Nasa base is laughable. There is a base with literally hundreds of people working there, in the middle of a field without the huge parking lot for all their pickups trucks. Remember earth is dying so everyone has a V8 pickup to find Indian drones....Then there is the so called ""science"" in the movie, apparently they even hired a professor to help them with the science part. Well dear professor, please join McConaughey as a car salesman as you don't have one clue about science and if the audience thinks the movie is using it, i have a bad feeling about the future of our species..The radiation, the fact that they walk about on a planet with sun light orbiting a black hole, where we have so much gravity that every hour there is 7 years on earth and even the same for the station they left orbiting just 200 miles up... Is just one silly example. Of course McConaughey has no problems with relativity time shifts once he enters the black hole... of course.. How could he otherwise meet up with his dying daughter to make a real American ending to this disaster of a movie.Then there is the robot, made for a budget movie, looking so cheap and probably assembled from cardboard with aluminum foil , as you can see it almost bobbing about in the wind. Two obligatory LCD panels show scrolling text as the robot talks and stumbles about.That robot sets the level for the special effects, they look cheap , badly filmed from the perspective of the space ship most of the time, as if they had some plastic contraption with a go-pro attached to it, handled by a 12 year old going ""Bzzzzzzz"" as he moves it about. Yes its that bad.There are many bad movies around, and this is just one of them, but what baffles me is why this piece of overlong budget fantasy gets so many good reviews. Did the people here not see other movies, ever ? Did they miss Alien, Gravity or even Star Wars, not that the last one is science fiction but at least its entertaining and this was not.Hoping Hollywood wakes up at some point and starts making movies again with depth and science instead of cheap fantasy aimed at , yeah what IS the target audience for this.And McConaughey please leave the movie industry and join the nearest Chevy dealer."
289," Awful, Absolutely pointless
","It was awful, absolutely pointless. Without any drama that we can expect from this kind of directors, Nolan tried to make you excited by visual effect and music but these tricks! also doesn't work. We can clearly see everything comes from market: last year Gravity made and worked and Matthew McConaughey comes to media because of one successful series and film and today these two come together for more profit, or to just save the humanity :)) It's very funny and this film received high points because it can't even entertain you. I think generally saving the world idea like this film is bullshit and wasting the time but i diet think that it can be successful jet in box office like this. Don't waste your time and don't engage in fake world."
290," I aged 23 years watching this movie
","Interesting in parts, but I aged 23 years watching it. Derivative of many other films including Contact, 2001, Forbidden Planet, Signs and most egregiously North by Northwest. Worst score in recent memory. Also, some of the special effects are pretty lame--all too obvious when models are being used. Gravity was much more visually arresting. Way too many close up horror expressions. The universe is supposed to be filled by interstellar gas, which must be true, given so much gassy dialog. Nolan manages to work in the Do Not Go Gently Into That Good night poem not once, but four times (look for the last time on a plague at the end."
291," I gave Nolan a chance, he disappointed me once again.
","I felt like I could not miss this movie, especially since it is going to be part (a huge part) of the next Oscars night. I've never been a fan of Nolan's, from his Memento, to Inception: Interstellar could have been the movie that could just change my mind. Nope. It didn't happen. It's not easy to review this movie, it's like a big puzzle which screen-players turned it into a big mess. It alternates some visually strong scenes, to some absolutely cheap ones. The dialogues: 3/10 were brilliant, the rest were almost senseless and useless; the movie reaches some high emotive peaks, but again, I'm not fully convinced: they wanted to make audience cry, it tastes like a cheap trick. Matthew McCounaghey is fabulous, as always. The rest of the cast is under expectations. Michael Caine, C. Affleck, A. Hathaway, Jessica Chastain. Maybe it's not their fault: maybe it's just their characters, who are emptier than my pockets right now. I've a suggestion for all of yours dear readers: go watching Moon, avoid Interstellar. And if you really want to feel what's Interstellar like, add to your watch-list (together with Moon), ""Click"". Yes, you read it well."
292," Pretentious and Overrated Trip
","In a post-apocalyptic future, crop blight is destroying civilization. The former pilot and engineer Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) lives in a farm in the countryside with his teenage son Tom, his daughter Murph and father-in-law Donald (John Lithgow). Murph is convinced that there is a ghost in her room trying to communicate with her and Cooper decodes a message with a coordinate. He heads to the location and finds a hidden NASA facility. Cooper meets Professor Brand (Michael Caine) that explains that they have found a wormhole and sent several spacecraft to seek a planet to send mankind. Only three of them are returning signals and now they want to launch the spacecraft Endurance to recover the collected data. He invites Cooper to be the pilot of Endurance and travel with his daughter Amelia (Anne Hathaway); the scientists Doyle (Wes Bentley) and Romilly (David Gyasi); and the robots TARS and CASE. Cooper accepts and Murph is overwhelmed with his decision. Copper crosses the wormhole to a distant galaxy in the beginning of a dangerous trip to save mankind. ""Interstellar"" is a sci-fi with a pretentious and overrated trip by the Hollywood darling Christopher Nolan. The story has a promising beginning, but becomes totally nonsense in the moment that Cooper leaves Brand. The plot is pretentious and uses Einstein relativity theory and other scientific concepts that are impossible to know whether they have scientific accuracy or not. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Interestelar"" (""Interstellar"")"
293," Dull dull dull, but some incredible visuals
","I like movies. I watch them a lot. I personally know 2 of the actors in this film, and also some people connected to the scoring. After all the hype I was geared up to watch it. I fell asleep once within the first hour and drifted in and out of consciousness throughout the film. It's too long, waaay to much dialogue - a completely bombastic storyline and Matthew just irritated me.I could give a much more well rounded review and get all academic - but its not worth it. I really can't sum up the words to say how much of a dull experience this was. There are some crazy visuals once they eventually get into space - but the dialogue and the actual audio mix is really lame.Watch it if you really have nothing else to do - or perhaps if you're a drug user it might work better under the influence. Since I don't take drugs - that's just a wild guess - it might - actually - make it even worse. One thing for sure - I wouldn't watch it again. Not for all the tea in China."
294," Not what I expected......
","I think I watched the same film as all the others on here that disliked it. I enjoyed the cinematography and the effects but there is really nothing else about this film I can say I liked.I think Matthew McConaughey is a great character actor but in this film he just didn't fit, for me. His voice, stance, mannerisms all seem out of place. Like he just didn't care and wanted the paycheck. Not that all the blame for the bad film can be put on his shoulders. The rest of the cast, all but a small few of them, just weren't entertaining.From the maker of Inception I expected more. What I got was nearly 3 hrs of not a very good film.3/10 for the visuals. That's all I got. Disappointed."
295," A movie for the Minecraft generation
","I knew nothing about Interstellar other than the basic premise, and the name of a film's director is of little interest to me i.e. I know who the good directors are, but their name on the credits doesn't set my expectations at any level.I just want a good plot, good acting, and something to take away and think about when the credits roll.I got none of that with this sorry excuse for a sci-fi film.From corn fields to a worm hole? with nothing much in between? Really? Anyway, I thought CASE and TARS were straight out of Minecraft... and so was the whole premise of Interstellar. A nothing sort of movie that leaves the viewer with nothing of substance.Motorcycle, meet shark! Actually, just take the shark from the tank and slap Christopher Nolan across the face with it.The 9 and 10 star reviews here truly mystify me..."
296," I'm a big Nolan fan... and I'm disappointed
","Let me bring you this in overview. PRO: - Stunning visually, through and through - Good acting by the entire cast - Interesting concept - A strong second half - A somewhat satisfying ending - A few interesting twists - The main musical theme is amazing. CON: - It took too long for anything truly interesting to happen. It had a few good moments, but in general the whole first half of the movie was... a tiny bit boring. If it hadn't been a Nolan movie, I would probably have left in the break. I'm glad I didn't. But the first half makes me not want to see this movie again. - There are really too many plot holes. Or moments that are not well-explained enough for them to be plausible. Things like characters experiencing revelations based on... well, pretty much nothing. Especially near the end. Which doesn't take away from the awesomeness of the second half. But one has to overlook these things to enjoy the story. - Besides the main theme, most of the score seem misplaced. Too loud. Too bombastic. Or not adding to the emotions on screen. And I'm speaking as a huge Hans Zimmer fan here.All in all, I would recommend seeing it. Definitely. But with an expectation that it's not as special as we've come to expect from Nolan."
297," A Movie That Thinks It's More IMPORTANT Than It Is
","If you thought Prometheus was ground-breaking, thoughtful, scientifically-plausible sci-fi, you will love this. This is another hollow, vapid ""sci-fi"" flick written by people who obviously don't love the category. They're so busy trying to explain everything, as if they're embarrassed by the very concepts they're presenting and don't want to be considered ""out there"" and still want to hang with the cool kids.There are so many incredibly & laughably stupid and boring moments and decisions in this movie, that it is very hard to resist the urge to describe them verbatim. Understand, this is also hard to accomplish when the whole movie is staggered, Jenga-like, on plot twists.I consider Memento, Insomnia, and The Prestige to be Nolan's best films. Inception was overwrought and over-hyped, but enjoyable. I thoroughly enjoyed The Dark Knight Rises, even though aware of serious plot holes and a borderline-excessive runtime.For me, Interstellar is the worst of Inception (thinks it's more clever and important than it really is) and the worst of Dark Knight Rises (excessive runtime and damaging plot holes), without the fun or grounding of either.From its overdone, overlong opening on Earth, those 40+ minutes make you wonder how a movie named ""Interstellar"" is ever going to get into space. McConaughey as Cooper is a former NASA astronaut, now just a farmer trying to sustain his crops, son and daughter in a near-future Earth wherein the planet is dying from a not-well-explained or illustrated depopulation and blight. It doesn't help anything that the actor has recently made those embarrassing Lincoln commercials and then to see him talking 'deeply' while driving a truck.Right from the outset, within mere minutes, the only thought that runs through one's mind is: Has Nolan forgotten how to edit his films? Seriously, the whole first quarter or third of the movie is just a very contrived setup for the space adventure that follows.As I stated, it's hard to be more-specific about the movie, and even certain characters and stars, without revealing key plot points. Cooper's daughter, Murphy, is a critical element of the story, as is the family home and (don't ask) the bookcase in her room. But, as much as the movie (or its makers) thinks that you're never going to figure out all of its secrets, they're actually quite obvious (if preposterous) just by knowing that everything is predicated on plot twists.There are some interesting moments when things move into space, and some scenes that resonate regarding the expansive loss of time (relative to that experienced on Earth) for the 4 travelers on a mission to find a new home. But, that connection those scenes make with the viewer are nearly instantly lost because they are nearly all intertwined with stupid writing decisions. Why only 4 travelers? How could they possibly have enough fuel to travel to so many places when earlier expeditions made 1-way trips to only 1 place? Why would the crew split-up unevenly? Why wouldn't Earth send 2 women and 2 men instead of 3 men and 1 woman, when there's a chance they won't be able to return? At least, in a worst-case scenario, if all survived, and they did find a sustainable planet that they couldn't return from, they'd be evenly-paired and (if 1 woman had medical issues) they'd have a better chance to sustain the species.You might think I'm nitpicking on this, but I assure you: this is something the movie itself gets you actively thinking about (species propagation) because of the ""Plan B"" option of the mission. (Yes, it is referred to as such in the movie.) Perhaps, most crushing to a real sci-fi fan, the film plays extremely loose with physics and depicts worlds which are made less-interesting than they first appear. With the ice world, in particular, there is a concept about its construction which is suggested...gets your imagination running beyond what you're seeing with the special effects, and then that cool vision is very shortly robbed from you.And that, perhaps, is this movie's worst crime: Robbery. It robs you of your time, which is excessive but would be forgivable if it didn't also rob you of your soul and your imagination. Unlike a masterpiece of cinema like 2001: A Space Odyssey, which opens your mind and lets you ponder what is happening, Interstellar never misses a chance to tell you EXACTLY what it wants you to believe. Even to the very most revealing parts of the end. And, that the movie dares to suggest an opportunity for a continuance of the story...I'm sorry, this film was only slightly more intelligent and entertaining than the dreadful Transformers: Age of Extinction. As preposterous as that may sound, Interstellar is clearly cut from the same 'blockbuster cloth', without as much mindless action. As imperfect as Oblivion and Elysium were, they were at least attempts at ""thinking man's sci-fi"". This is really just a very flimsy father/daughter love story wrapped over to hide a bunch of sci-fi nonsense that its own producers were self-consciously embarrassed of....And then there are the robots. --The most inexplicable, ridiculously-designed robots ever to grace sci-fi cinema. There is a moment, in a scene set in a shallow ocean, where we suddenly see the full capabilities of the robots, but it plays a bit like R2-D2 actually having booster jets in the Star Wars prequels, but never having or using them in the chronologically-later movies. If you do torture yourself by watching the Blu-ray, have an extra laugh by watching the making-of documentary on how they articulated these implausible robots using practical effects."
298," protracted, nonsensical
","The good: The creative design of their robot +1the visuals of the water-planetmaybe the ice-planet as well+1Things that made this film bad:All the scenes that did not add anything to the story, including the very slow start.The sabotaging behavior of Matt Damon, was just added to make drama. From the moment Matt attacked Matthew, I knew the movie was bad.That the crew members would believe Matt's description of the planet is unlikely. The planet was visibly frozenIt will always be pointless to reach the center of a black hole, since it would mean certain death. They tried to describe it as a necessary sacrifice, but the thinking behind was just nonsense.I have no Idea what they tried to illustrate as happening in the black hole. There are no books to be found in a black hole. Timetravel backwards in time is impossible.The excessive use soundtrack music and unnecessary loud music. The plot overall was far from something that could have happened in reality."
299," Astronomy and physics good – Terrible storyline – full of the black holes!
","Science Fiction is not an excuse for lazy writing and sloppy direction.Starts off showing flowing fields of thriving green vegetation – constantly bombarded by massive dust storms and yet continues to grow and thrive. Then, we are supposed to believe that a drone – one that can fit in the back of a pickup truck has enough solar cells to power 'an entire farm.'After that, Jonathan Nolan and Christopher Nolan (Screenplay) expect us to believe that a retired NASA pilot, who never left Earth orbit and survived crashing his orbital spacecraft, is more experienced to go on an interstellar voyage than the astronauts that have studied and prepared for the voyage. Okay, I'll admit this one is possible, but not likely.The first planet they decide to visit – the one so close to a black hole it has significant time dilation – the one covered in water and deluged with huge waves every hour, (one of which destroyed the original exploration spacecraft and killed the pilot – not detected by the spacecraft instruments, by the way) is a prime candidate for colonization.Then, when the next huge wave arrives, Christopher Nolan (Director) makes us watch as one of the astronauts stands by the spacecraft door for several seconds (plenty of time to get in the spacecraft) watching the wave approach and is washed away. Why did he stand around waiting outside the spacecraft in the first place! Nonsensical!The next thing the Nolan brothers expect us to believe is that an astronaut who volunteered for what was probably a one-way mission suddenly goes crazy, becomes a coward, falsifies data, and turns into a murderer! Were his rescuers going to leave him on the planet to die after they found out the planet was uninhabitable! Don't think so!Later, this same coward astronaut decides to take a chance and risk his life opening the spacecraft hatch after warnings that doing so would cause a blowout. I guess we supposed to believe he is that crazy!"
300," I so much wanted to like it but...
","I'm really sorry. I so much wanted to like this film. So much has gone into it and the concept is good, but it just didn't work for me. I found this to be a compact and fanciful story stretched up to intergalactically implausible proportions. It didn't ring true, and it was full of Hollywood formulae, like clumsy cliffhangers. And why did we have to have a Western-style fight scene on an icy planet on the other side of a black hole? There were no punches thrown in 2001.People will say it was too long but it wouldn't be any better if it was shorter. It is also an unremittingly dark and depressing film except for certain aspects. The brilliant special effects, loud sound track and music served to mask the shortcomings. On the plus side it is thought-provoking about space and physics, the actors gave everything, especially the main character, he was brilliant - it didn't have George Clooney in it a big plus. The concept is excellent, and it dramatises aspects of Einstein's theory of relativity such as meeting your children who have grown older than you.I hope a lot of people like it, as I wouldn't want all that effort and commitment to go to waste, so just ignore my opinion! Go and watch it and make up your own mind!"
301," Could have been better
","Special effects are the real winner in this movie, not the plot, not the acting. Most of the story makes little sense and the characters are annoying, except for the ever charming Michael Caine. The plausibility factor was as poor as some 1950's sci-fi and less fun. Back to the Future was and is more interesting. I would have to say it was not a boring movie, but too much talking and teen angst out of adult scientists. Ann Hathaway has no place playing anyone with a PhD. The ""Dust Bowl"" effect was not terribly convincing, they could have made it seem a lot grimmer. There were too many ""that wouldn't happen"" moments for me, I couldn't suspend reality because they would keep mixing facts in and then do stuff that was pointless and unrealistic. The noise of the background was so loud often I couldn't understand the dialog, low bass organ music and rocket engine noise so loud my chair vibrated. The characters were doing things that didn't add to the story and just seemed immature, you almost couldn't root for the human race to survive."
302," bad movie
",I love sci-fi thrillers and all. I hated this one. There is something fundamentally wrong with this movie. The story reads as an excuse. An excuse to keep you in a room and play some space flight scenes. The film tried so much that ended up failing in everything. I think the problem is the blend of emotional crap with band-aid surrealistic physics that makes no sense just so that emotion could be the focus of this crap movie. I would really like to convey my opinion but this movie only left 2 brain cells properly working. It is that bad. I sincerely hope I make it. I have been drooling ever since I left the cinema.
303," Not as good as it could be
","The movie is incredibly beautiful but it is not intelligent but is mostly a strange mix that does not quite know what it wants. I like it when science and technology are described believable which at times is the case here, but just as in the masterpiece in 2001, it falls hard when you mix in philosophy with a high level of abstraction. Of course there are more holes in the script than can be listed here. One obvious to me is that if the descendants of humanity are those that make us survive Who was it that saved us the first time?We meet several parallel stories and my 14 year old daughter even shed a tear over something she could not quite explain afterwards. We meet the stories about how humans devastated the earth's resources, technophobia and heroes immortality. The only person who seems quite realistic, however, Matt Daemon. It's like his mixture of malice, selfishness and cowardice doing so the movie gets off the ground for a short while. And it is of course not good for a film largely set in space (pun intended)."
304," Don't believe the hype
","""Interstellar"" was an above average film and I have no regrets spending a Friday night checking it out. Unsophisticated audiences may enjoy it if they don't analyze it too deeply. However, if you are one who understands the world of physics, aviation, or space travel, this one is hard to watch. There are a plethora of continuity issues as well as plot holes. It seems like Chris Nolan watched ""Gravity"" and decided he could make a really terrible film into something worth watching. He added the ""Contact"" premise and inserted some Physics theories and some expanded back story to create a mediocre film. I was hopeful that I would be impressed by the obviously inflated reviews but I wasn't. The guy next to me actually fell asleep during the first hour which was very grueling. Of our group, there were three thumbs down and one thumbs up."
305," Uh.....I Just Don't Get This At All.
","How this travesty of a ""sci-fi"" movie has garnered so many gilded reviews is proof that either A) I am way out of step with the great, unwashed movie-going masses or B) the aforesaid masses have never seen a truly great ""sci-fi"" flick. This movie was interminable; I almost walked out 38 minutes into the run, when Mathew was still just a former test pilot trapped in the body of a corn-huskin' farmer. Which leads me to my first problem with Interstellar: would you ""hire"" a corn-huskin' farmer and devoted Dad of 2 to be the pilot of an intergalactic space mission? Aside from 1 or 2 very brief allusions, there is ZERO explanation / justification for Matt to be selected for this mission. And strangely enough, Michael Caine ages not 1 day in the 23 years since Matt blasts off for ""strange new worlds"".He is still in the same pants and shirt as he was when Matt blasted off (23 years before); the directors did give Mike a wheelchair for good measure. Before I proceed, there were 2 or 3 somewhat interesting plot twists, and the CGI / special FX were very good (just like ""Gravity"", another recent ""sci-fi"" disappointment); although the robot was utterly ridiculous; more like a walkin', talking' 21st century soda machine or a ""Gen 12"" Robbie the Robot. Of course, CGI and special FX alone do not a classic ""sci-fi"" film make. I cannot disclose 2 major plot disappointments due to the ""spoiler"" clause but suffice it to say the powers behind this film have tried to fuse an entry level class in quantum physics with an action film; and it just didn't work. I have now accepted, grudgingly, that for enough money you can get the finest actors to play in the most ludicrous films. Read the cast list; scratch your heads in disbelief, along with me. And if you want a classic ""sci-fi"" movie? Try 2001, Blade Runner, and Alien."
306," Science Violated
","I went to this movie based on all the good reviews I read. I thought it would be an intelligent scenario making use of some scientific theories like Relativity, Theory of Everything, Time dilation, Gravity Waves, Black Holes, Worm Hole etc.Was I let down beyond ridiculous ! So the world's population is on the brink of extinction due to climate change and some kind of fungus is destroying all the crops and lack of water turned everything into dust.And we get to meet this farmer (Matthew McConaughey) who used to be a very successful Astronaut / Pilot who crashed his aircraft so he decided to become a farmer to raise corn instead. Good choice because the world needs more farmers than NASA pilots. And he gets called in to Parents- Teachers meeting to discuss his children's future and the teacher says ""We faked the moon landing to bankrupt the Russians"" and the books will need to be updated to reflect this ! Good ammunition for all the loonies who still believe this crap ! They tell the father their children should study agriculture because the world needs more of them. Of course our sensible father wants his children to become scientists and wont tell his children what the teacher said. On the way home they encounter a drone and the father has in his truck all the gear (a laptop !) necessary to take control of the drone while plowing his truck in three feet high corn crop. This was only the beginning of the ridiculousness that followed. Somehow his daughter who is brilliant, is getting some messages with the arrangement of the books in the library. She says it's like a bar code of binary information. During a dust storm they see the dust arranged such a way to give a message to the father. This advanced civilization does not have any other means to communicate but has control of gravity!. So the father gets the message which are coordinates and drives his truck to the location which turns out to be NASA operating underground because Government does not want to spend money on NASA while the world is starving. Yet they have this huge rocket built by whatever funds they acquired waiting to be sent to a worm hole conveniently waiting around Saturn for them to go through...They already sent scientists across the universe to some other galaxy and getting back some messages but only limited success. So they need someone to pilot their rocket because they only had pilots with simulator experience. Of course our hero pilot who crashed his last mission is the perfect match for this job. His job is to figure out which planet is suitable for life and come back to tell the people of the world to pack up and move to another Galaxy ! Oh yeah they can also communicate via video messages across light years of space..(Thank you Nolan for solving the biggest problem we have:Ultimate Speed of Light) *Spoilers ahead* I wont go into all the inconsistencies like going through a black hole (and surviving intact !) ending up back on Earth years before (!) he left, in his daughter's room behind a library where he can push and arrange the books but can't talk to her. Apparently he is in another dimension built by some super advanced civilization (who are actually us !). The only way to communicate with her is through time by moving the dials of a watch and gives her the solution to Theory of Everything, reconciling Quantum Theory with General Relativity ! So the daughter yells Eureka and all the problems of humanity are solved. And, somehow he comes back to Earth crashing his craft and wakes up in the future, on a space station where all the people of Earth live now. But since the people of the Earth has aged more than him according to Einstein's Relativity, his daughter is now in death bed and tells him to go rescue Brand (Anne Hathaway) who is now in another galaxy waiting patiently...I still don't get why people give 10 stars to this movie. 2001:A Space Odyssey made in the 60's was light years beyond this movie in scenario and scientific and technological accurateness."
307," the most over rated movie of all time
","I love dramatic movies. I love Sci-Fi movies. I love most of Christopher Nolan's work. I was so excited to see interstellar after all the 10/10 reviews but after seeing it, I was thoroughly disappointed.My actual rating is probably 6/10, I rated 1/10 to balance the other ratings.!!!SPOILERS AHEAD!!!Here are my major problems with this movie: 1)Over dramatized effects throughout 2)Every character except for 3 of them was just a red-shirt with no characterization, just created to be killed off 3)The science aspect was stupid, especially in the second half 4)Did this highly developed 5D race have any way to save humans besides creating a room, that a guy would go to to tell himself to go there so that he could send binary through a watch to his daughter that is older than he is? 5)The ending was a thorough disappointment. Everything was happy dandy and the whole human race was saved just because of data from a black hole? They never explain why that data is even useful 6)Poorly designed and explained apocalypse. Earth didn't seem to be in much peril. 7)Okay, when Mann blew the airlock, couldn't the others just TELL him that it would blow up half the ship instead of saying ""Don't do it, its not the right decision"" 8)Really? The voice of corruption is called ""Mann""? That was a stupid metaphor. 9)I don't think there was even enough water on Millers planet to make waves those big, seeing as it wasn't even knee deep. 10)Just wasn't what it was cracked up to be. The film was heavily lacking in character development and plot, the science aspect was unbelievable and stupid.Parts that I liked (No, it didn't ALL suck): 1)TARZ was pretty cool. He was unique compared to all other robots from sci-fi movies I've seen. 2)The highly dramatized parts would have been good in moderation, and there were some good special effects 3)I didn't fall asleep which is goodI just can't believe so many people are raving over this movie. It's like they're too dumb to see past special effects and blaring music to see that the movie itself wasn't any good. People try to tell me the science in this movie could've made sense because it's not discovered yet. I think a planet with alien dinosaurs who speak English would have been more believable.It's worth seeing so you can realize how wrong everyone is, but don't expect too much."
308," C. Nolan discovers the 5th dimension
","No need for a spoiler here. the ending is so bizarre, unbelievable, and pretentious. it is the type of ending a Hollywood director on LSD might make. That being said, Nolan does make the 5th dimension a reality--stupidity. I can't believe the yawning of 10s and 9s. I guess you cannot trust the critics or the movie audience anymore. if you believe that movies should be believable, coherent, and enjoyable then you fail the test to see this move. period. So my advice to you is simple, read the book first. oh wait, there is no book? that is because there isn't a publishing company that would print it. let me give you a line from the movie, and you tell me if it is worth seeing. ""Who are they?"" ""I dunno, but they are real and wanted us to be here."" That is because We are they."" oooookaaay."
309," Interstellar Missed by a Galaxy - 2/10 - *** SPOILERS ***
","This is my first review on here but I had to say something. I just left the theater and I haven't felt like this in 15 years. Yes, that's right, not since 1999, not since, dare I say it, ""Star Wars - Episode 1 - The Phantom Menace"". And I've only been waiting for this movie for a little over a year!All I have to say is the following; Interstellar was an incoherent, implausible, unscientific, misandrist mess.*** SPOILERS BEGIN HERE ***1. The protagonist in this film, Cooper, is denied the prize of his journey and sacrifice only to give it to the female characters of the movie. His daughter inherits the knowledge of both her father and Caine's scientist character and mysteriously solves the gravity equation which inexplicably saves the world. Anne Hathaway's character is saved by Cooper's sacrifice so she can become some galactic 'Eve' on a new planet. Ridiculous. What is she going to do, make an appointment at the IVF clinic on planet X? Is she going to give birth to ten daughters and artificially inseminate them in turn? Nonsense.2. The antagonist, Matt Damon's character, is nothing but a caricatured villain whose motivations are never explained. He is shown as being weak and a coward. No one with these qualities would ever volunteer for a mission like this or last this long on a desert planet without killing themselves. They even called him Dr. Mann which makes him come across as representing all men as weak and evil. Ugh!3. The old and wise scientist turns out to be a liar. Michael Caine's character is shown to have duped everyone on the mission because he knew somehow that plan A would never work? He's just and @#$#? WTF!4. The brother, who for some reason Cooper doesn't give two @#$% about turns into an insane madman.5. The mission which takes them on a journey for thousands of light years of space travel only to circle back to a little girl's bedroom to show that a girl's intuition and love trumps science on any day of the week! Absolute nonsense!!!THE ONLY MEN IN THIS MOVIE THAT ARE GIVEN ANY REDEEMING QUALITIES IS THE BLACK MAN AND THE ROBOT.Mr. Nolan, and I'm sure you read this garbage, please take this advice for your next film: You don't need to water down your male heroes with emotional drivel and juvenile female sentiment to get women to watch your movies. You did this in Inception and TDKR when you jammed in Marion Cotillard's awful emotional subplots into an otherwise brilliant story.Take the example of 2010: Odyssey Two. A forgotten sci-fi gem of the eighties. This movie had a very strong female lead played brilliantly by Hellen Mirren. Her character was most believable because she was in balance with her equally strong, intelligent male counterparts which included Roy Scheider and John Lithgow (anyone catch the hot dog reference?).If you modeled this movie after 2010 instead of 2001, I think you could have reached your biggest audience. Unfortunately, I will not be part of this one.I gave this movie two stars for some original ideas the movie tried to do. The story, the score and some god-awful performance by Matt Damon made it impossible to keep this movie together. Etc, etc, etc...DSMan"
310," Mumbling actors and extremely loud music - not a great combination.
","I never really felt much interested in Interstellar because I'm pretty bored with Christopher Nolan now. His films are getting increasingly more epic and complex but at the same time, predictable. I just feel I know exactly what I am going to get so don't have any inclination to watch his films.But, stuck for something to watch this weekend, we gave it a go.The last 20 minutes were a bit of an emotional roller coaster (despite what seemed like a few plot holes and inconsistencies, which I need to look into in case I just didn't get it). But it did not make up for the rest of the film, which I found not only boring but irritating.Most of the film I felt was unwatchable because Matthew McConaughey (an over-rated actor whom I don't like anyway) mumbles his way through the entire performance, meaning I had to turn the volume up high to hear what he was saying. However, there are frequent bursts of extremely loud music, far far louder than necessary and since the volume is up high to compensate for mumbling, it constantly suddenly gets too loud to comfortably watch. I had to sit through the whole film with the remote control at the ready, adjusting the volume up and down for the whole duration. When viewing the IMDb boards I can see this is a common problem and it has even been up for discussion in the newspapers. Now, whether Nolan intended this anomaly or not I don't care, it made the film irritating and difficult to watch.Apart from that, I found the whole thing dull. The characters were dull, the storyline was dull and I do not have the desire to watch this film ever again so it has no repeat-viewing value."
311," By So Far, The Worst Movie In 15 Years. Period.
","This is awful. Awful in every single sense - this length of three endless hours, this snotty sentimental atmosphere, these unbearably slow and hammy dialogs. Everything is poor and mediocre in this production. The tonality is set wrong and it is false all through. Then, the cast - Matthew McConaughey is teary, lame and languid. He is the weakest chain here and his efforts to be endearing or touchy do not touch or endear. Anne Hathaway? Probably, her worst part in years. Michael Caine? John Lithgow? Nope, lame at all costs. Avoid this poorly scripted, badly shot, lousily edited slowpoke of a torture. This is just a mere waste of time, and the idea is lost in utter drabness. Let's be honest - I did not understand the idea, the moral and the message. I was totally sucked and drained. And them, this horrendous loud music that deafens the dialog and simply deafens. Why? Why was that so loud and boring? In a word, bad. Bad, bad, bad thing. The worst in years, and I mean it."
312," An 8.8 rating? For Garbage?
","I would have given this the 1 it deserves but since it's not based on an actual event I cut them some slack.I'm so glad that Einstein figured out the principals of relativity. Most of the people I meet still think the world revolves around them. Then Einstein played the ""what if"" game with Physics. What if you could travel near the speed of light and take a trip, blah, blah, blah. You can't. They can't. Here's where the 8.8 rating comes from. People want to believe almost anything that is impossible. This movie is garbage.I'm not humorless. Time travel is garbage too but I enjoyed the BACK TO THE FUTURE trilogy. It was funny and kinda clever. Not this rag. Save your money and remember: your life clock is ticking and there's no way you're going to recover an of it that you spend, in this case 3 hours."
313," One of the dumbest sci-fi films ever made
","The production values are A+ but the writing is that of a class B picture. Filled with ridiculous, spacious claims and assumptions. The premise itself is the weakest link, but then there is a ton of little mistakes like driving through a sandstorm or placement of the conference room, that can really strain ones suspension of disbelief. It's akin to presenting Cinderella as a re-imagining of what life was like in medieval times.what was amazing was that there was no sound in space scenes (other than music) e.g. on thrusters. Usually I would appreciate that but it was doubly distracting as they seem to have left a few dozen more obvious, glaring oversights in.Then there is the horrendous acting by Anne Hathaway, and Jessica Chastain to a lesser extent. Those two ladies make Matthew McConaughey look like Alec Guinness. And McConaughey, with his annoying way of speech, like he's got his mouth full of peanut butter or some other brown substance, playing what has got to be one of the dumbest smart-guys in film history. In all fairness, they were probably going for tough but sensitive and smart just got lost in the cracks.It gets better as they get to the wormhole and some of the scenes located outside of earth are entertaining, it does not however save the viewer from a fate worse than Contact."
314," Never want to say something bad about a movie..but this one just doesn't deserve this high score...
","OK, I was fooled by both some of the reviews and the high score, and I wasted about 3 hours of my life sitting in the cinema...I can't say I'm a sci-fi lover, but if films like Blade Runner only get 8.2, then this one should get 4-5... I watched Gone Girl the other day which is so much better than this one, both in pacing and plot and that film only get 8.4...how can this one get 9?!Another thing is, the ending is too predictable and too sweet!!! Happy ending is good, people love things that make them happy, but in reality there never has a perfect ending like that....the ending seems too sweet for me and some people are spoiled by these good endings.Also don't understand why made the brother a completely fool?! He seems has nothing to do with everything?! A contrast? To what? and the film never mentioned him after the girl (sorry I even don't remember their names) find out the secret, which doesn't make sense to me...Anyway, I'm disappointed and I don't want t say more about this film, I fell asleep several times due to that horrible pacing...I can't believe a film could be sooooo long which almost becomes a torture for me..."
315," Highly overrated movie!
","I'm just gonna say that I'm very disappointed. Went to cinema with high expectations after seeing 9.2 score here on IMDb and I after reading some of the reviews here as well.The realistic score would be somewhere around 7.0 and I am giving it 1 star just to bring current rating down as much as possible since the movie is highly overrated! Producers probably hired excellent PR team and those guys are doing a hell of a job to promote this movie! I'm big Sci-Fi genre fan but this movie has so many plot holes, underdeveloped characters, it's too long and for moments even boring. Visual effects? Poor comparing to Gravity or even Prometheus.Should you see this movie? If you are a big SCI-FI fun, I'd say yes, but set your expectations low and perhaps you find it worth seeing."
316," Garbage; seriously questions humanities future for the praise it gave this film
","I can't believe anyone found this movie even mildly entertaining let alone brilliant. even more preposterous are the comparisons to 2001???? Like all of Nolan's other movies, InterstellI'm not going to write synopsis or give details but simply share my opinion.There was nothing even remotely 'good' about this film. It attempted to blend ideas and plots from past Sci-Fi films, but in the end turned out to be a disconnected and poorly developed mess. Everything from the crap science to the uninteresting characters,cheesy and awkward dialog, to the story, or lack thereof made this film unwatchable. The characters did not come off like scientists; they didn't even come off like people in such dire situations would. Such as making jokes about being an asshole when confronted by a massive black hole. Anne Hathaway's character was particularly inferior. I seriously wanted someone to strangle her. Of course this could have been excused if the movie didn't take itself so serious or had some redeeming qualities/aspects. However, the film tries so hard to be profound, but it ends up being awkward. the end"
317," Mostly Slow, Confusing Jumble
","I thought this movie would be great; the plot sounded fun and intriguing, but this movie falls far short of being fleshed out. Most of the movie was slow, with a lot of quiet dialogue on very complex concepts. It was also unclear how some characters fit in ... the female astronaut is in love with who back home? Have we been introduced to this guy? Do we care? Huge jumps in storyline were glossed over: daughter Murph invented the orbiting earthlike station which saved humanity? What? And the 2001: A Space Odyssey bent near the end is overwhelmingly derivative. Overall, it seems like there must be way too much of this screenplay that fell by the wayside somewhere."
318," A Film Feigning Importance
","Somewhere on the path to juxtaposing the story of the imminent death by starvation of humanity on Earth against a desperate search for a new planetary home (hopefully to not similarly despoil), the authors of ""Interstellar"" forgot to consider the audience and instead created a far too long, far too arcane and far too pet film. ""Interstellar"" is a kissin' cousin to the equally pet, pseudo mind-blowing, con man sleight-of-hand ""Inception.""A bitter taste is left in the mouth by a self-satisfied script constantly trumpeting a specialness that, alas, is not at all special.Audiences have been beat to death by the tropes, plot elements and dialogue seen so many times before. For example, the ""Pursued By Demons Retired ______ Forced Back Into Service"" trope.Women, as in most films, are relegated to the back of the bus. When will writers and filmmakers wake up to the richness in woman's hearts and minds - even a cold scientist's ticker and noggin?Face-down-death awaits the character with the fewest lines and closeup. (Much like the Bic 'Red Shirts' in ""Star Trek"" you knew would never make it to the end credits.)An intelligent young woman becomes hysterical because Daddy's leaving, yet her intellect does not grasp his mission is important: To save her and the rest of the world. Beside, Daddy didn't explain, at least not on camera.Matt Damon resurrects from hypersleep to wreak havoc as in the hackneyed ""Don't Astronauts on ""The Twilight Zone"" Pass Basic Psych Tests?"" plot element.Don't forget the Dead Wife and Wise Grandpa tropes.Wonder is non-existent. That's quite a feat as few films have led us through a wormhole. ""Black Hole"" did a better job. At least the mysterious passage in Disney's opus didn't suggest injection into a globule borrowed from the coda of ""2001: A Space Odyssey."" (Also cobbed from Kubrick's masterpiece are the more human than humans (articulated) computers.)Cinematic corn served warm with a schmear of butter is quite delicious. Corn served cold by trying-too-hard actors sittin' on the porch waxin' philosophical is a dish best passed to the person sitting on your right.There are nonsensical interviews of dust storm survivors who describe what the special effects department has just shown. There's no lack of understanding why the run time is 169 minutes. The dogged determination to not self-edit and lose script pages underscores either Nolan's lack of being a good audience or not caring about audiences - the latter a quality indicative of too many contemporary filmmakers.The ending leads to head scratching that, in another film, would elicit laughs from the audience. Poltergeists my patootie!""Interstellar"" veers uncomfortably close to complete train wreck, but there are a few nice touches. While derivative, the articulated computers are cool. That mankind can solve mankind's problems without an advanced alien intelligence, God or other deus ex machina is the one original idea - and it's a good one.Save very few elements to recommend it, ""Interstellar"" is a really, really long bore pretending importance. There's nothing worse than films of that ilk."
319," Wait until Video Rental if you MUST
","It was..... Okay at BEST! Better wait for the Redbox version than it would be worth the money; I guess!Definitely not worth a Theater viewing; IMAX or NOT.It just wasn't that good.It was just Slow; Intense; Sometimes Predictable.Than the ultimate Book Shelf Stupid scene; REALLY!! Son, in his 20s fell asleep a number of times.I am in my 50s; started to get sleepy.I say again, if you want to see it wait for the video to come out"
320," One of the worst films of 2014
","Went in to see this film this afternoon and had high hopes. After an hour in I realised that I nearly nodded off twice as the music score playing over the beginning quarter of the film was sleep inducing to say the least. It didn't help that not one of the characters was engaging in anyway possible, especially Matthew McConaughey's drawling southern accent. It seem to take an age for anything to happen in the film, and finally when there was some movement, director Nolan slows everything back down to a snail's pace. I'm not saying the film was ridiculous as it is purely science fiction which I normally enjoy, but this was a challenge for me to stay till the end of the film ,-( two gents in the theatre walked out just over an hour in and never came back), I unfortunately didn't have the hindsight to do the same, otherwise I would have got over three hours of my life back to watch two good films.When the film is released on DVD/BR, I hope they have a cut that last's about 1hour and 20m which should make it an entertaining film without the huge unnecessary spongy filling."
321," Absolute brilliance (no spoilers)
","Its very difficult to explain the quality of an extremely good movie when you have so much interest in the subject. So I'm just saying: my review is based on the fact that i like space movies that forces us to think about whats out there.Its been 3 days since i watched interstellar and i still think about the amazing visuals, but most likely the storyline. The same as inception, this director creates a visual image that is so extremely close to my own imagination. But he actually puts it on a screen for me to enjoy? Thats just in word: unbelievable.This 3 hour journey takes you from a to z and it doesn't skip anything. Just when you think, they are probably not going to continue on this subject.. They do. You will get all your answers, in sometimes a difficult way.The lead actor shows a extreme amount of passion that really helps with the emotions on some points. I see this movie win more awards because its complete and i do not see that you should have shortened it, made it longer, have another interstellar or so on. Its done and its really good.I have to say that i noticed that a lot of people that review this movie expected things that they claimed was in the trailer or should have been in the movie. Like an alien race? I never got this from the trailer or any storyline. Also if you expect this movie to be fighting and alien wars i would understand you write a bad review, because this movie is not about that.Go to this movie with one simple thought: i have no idea what I'm about the see. I'm just going to enjoy this ride.10 out 10. I'm not giving this like candy bars."
322," a true masterpiece from Nolan
","If Memento was ambiguous, if The Prestige was smart, if Inception was deceiving, if The Batman Trilogy was a revelation, then Interstellar is hope-giving, inspiring, levitating, flabbergasting and more... It's a roller-coaster ride of transcendental thought process. Time as a relative theory, astrology as a whole, time-travel and lot other high level thinking is mandatory to go about the narration of this movie when our very little brain cells have a tough time differentiating between just a movie being watched in a cinema hall or being part of a galactic expedition.Interstellar is a science-fiction movie about a group of space travelers on a picaresque journey across the wormhole to find a habitable planet other than earth. Sounds familiar? We've had Blade Runner, A Space Odyssey, Contact or the recent Gravity along with numerous other ambitious takes on such top level prophecies, but what makes Interstellar a suffocating, impactive film?The amount of study that has gone into the making of the film is equivalent to a new find. Be it the concept of dimensions, futuristic world, or the unexplainable topics to the laymen, this story from the Nolan brothers is rather simple than all their previous outings. Interstellar in simple words, is a film about a father-daughter relationship. Taking the 'Dust bowl' as a primary setting for the story to have a beginning, Mr. Cooper is a farmer by choice but a trained pilot and engineer by profession. He is a single father who still believes the plight of their blight filled earth can be taken over by inhabiting another planet. His bright daughter Murphy doesn't want him to go on a NASA powered voyage fearing his return. Let's stop it there on making a futile attempt of describing the story.Interstellar has propelled itself to the pinnacle by an undeniably superior story, astute screenplay and stellar performances from the uncanny yet stubborn Mathew McConaughey as Cooper the pilot, Anne Hathaway as Amelia a committed scientist, Micheal Caine as Dr. Brand the chief and Jessica Chaistan as Murphy the abandoned daughter. Double Negative has taken up the herculean task of doing the visual effects for a Nolan film and has re-created unseen visuals of the wormhole, the outer space, inhabited planets of the other galaxy and of course the beautiful earth. The graphics and other digitally composited elements in the film are pretty much the life-line for the film, making the unseen portions of outer space look so convincing to us and not a compromised, make-believe platform. How will the engines of a space shuttle sound, how is sound transmitted in a planet that has only 80% gravity, how does a button sound when it is pressed by a finger that has astronaut's gloves on it?Hans Zimmer can never get tired of writing top-class music scores. Be it the nail-biting sequence of the shuttle docking into the mother-ship or the take-off into the space or the scene where Cooper gets to watch a video sent from his family, the musical support in the film is a parachute like life-saver for such a hard-hitting story. He elevates the film and positions it to an unreachable height of excellence and creativity. Interstellar has been filmed with anamorphic 35mm and IMAX 70 mm to give a different visage for the story. Hoyte Van Hoytema's (what word could you think of to describe his skill) cinematography will become a standard procedure on how science-fictions are to be shot. Made on a whopping budget of 165 million dollars, Nolan almost returned 10 million after filming from the original allocated budget. Private corn fields were bought and cultivated to be used as a major backdrop. Special IMAX cameras were made to shoot the interiors of the cockpit. Exclusively Robots were made for the film. 100 hours for rendering a single CG powered frame and what not first-timer for a film. Interstellar has started a race of its own for generation of film-makers to follow. Einstein's general relativity, Morse code, rotating black-hole and lot other complexities are dealt in Interstellar, but it is an emotional tale about the cosmos of survival. This piece of writing has no spoilers and talks nothing about, how great the film is. It is just an immediate response"
323," A waste of a beautiful Hans Zimmer soundtrack
","The beautiful music by Zimmer is literally the only enjoyable thing about this film and it's such shame that this soundtrack couldn't have been used for a truly good space film instead.The first time I saw Interstellar was at the movie theater and I actually fell asleep. Tried to watch it another time on Netflix and couldn't get farther than 1 hour in before becoming bored out of my skull. Can I just say that I love me a good space themed movie. ""Moon"", ""Sunshine"", ""Passengers"", ""The Martian"". Hell, I can even get through Kubrik's ""2001: Space Odussey""! But Interstellar will definitely not be part of that list.Now after a close friend mentioned this as being one of their favorite films of all time, I literally FORCED myself to watch through it again and man... what a waste of time. (don't tell my friend that!)Here are my problems with Interstellar:
1) Starting with the acting. Either the actors suck, the direction sucks or the script sucks. Probably a little bit of each. The things these characters say and the way they behave just doesn't feel natural or realistic. So much corny dialogue! The characters do absolutely NOTHING to compel me or make feel anything any sense of attachment for them. Even the little girl character which was meant to tug at your heart strings does nothing for me. Don't even get me started on the robots. To be fair, the fact that I find Matthew McConaughey highly annoying, doesn't help. Come to think of it, what would have helped is if his and Matt Damon's roles would have been reversed. Matt Damon makes for a much more approachable and lovable figure, where as McConaughey has always been much more suited to be kind of a selfish bad guy.2) So many illogical points in the film that leave you wondering: WHY? I have a tolerance for a certain amount of holes in a film, but this just has too many to bear.3) When you want to watch a space themed movie, you're expecting to see some amazing visuals that transport you to another time and place. But even in this department, Interstellar doesn't really deliver. There are a few cool snippets, but for the most part, the movie leans very much on the dialogue between characters.If you enjoyed the films I mentioned before, you will most likely be just as disappointed as I was by Interstellar."
324," ""Interstellar"" Is Big-Budget Disaster
","A couple years ago, there was a major motion picture called ""Cloud Atlas."" Never heard of it? That's because it bombed. It was a three-hour marathon of six non-intertwining stories, one of which held my interest. The least interesting depicted a futuristic world of cannibalism and idol-worship on the big island of Hawaii. I wrote at the time that Tom Hanks and Halle Berry are so bad in this story they seem like amateurs. The dialogue is stilted and ridiculous. I couldn't believe Warner Brothers had actually green-lighted this project.Now I've seen something similar. Christopher Nolan's ""Interstellar"" is a three-hour convoluted mess of science fiction, with a potentially interesting story buried somewhere deep inside the dialogue. To wit, in the future, the world is approaching the end of its habitability. I don't know why. It has something to do with crop blight, but if the explanation was in the script, I must have missed it. NASA has developed a secret plan to explore other potentially viable planets. Impossible, you say? Ah, but there is a ""wormhole"" near Saturn, which allows astronauts to explore five promising alternatives for the salvation of humanity. (A wormhole is a theoretical means of quickly traveling through space and time, based on Einstein's theory of relativity. Think of it like Han Solo traveling at warp speed, only it's supposed to sound more plausible.) I'm not sure anyone ever explained why all five planets were able to appear in the same place at the same time, when in reality, they must have been light-years apart from one another.The always-reliable Matthew McConaughey plays NASA pilot Cooper, and Anne Hathaway is Amelia, a scientist also aboard the rocket ship. In the best decision writers Jonathan and Christopher Nolan made, no romance is ever suggested between the two leads. I only wish they had done a better job of explaining what ""Interstellar"" is all about.After landing on one of the planets, Cooper and Amelia meet up with another scientist, Dr. Mann, played by Matt Damon, who was stranded on a previous mission. In the strangest plot twist, Dr. Mann tries to kill Cooper for some unexplained reason. Up until this point, I believed I could suspend my disbelief enough to recommend ""Interstellar."" But why wouldn't two NASA employs be able to work together? Is it because Nolan wanted Dr. Mann's shuttle to explode while attempting to dock with the rocket? Could be. Unlike last year's excellent ""Gravity,"" ""Interstellar"" is a loud, busy picture, overstuffed with special effects, unnecessary music, and screaming characters.Eventually, Cooper and Amelia venture into a black hole (yes, on purpose; don't ask why) where time appears spatially, allowing Cooper to visit his daughter in her childhood and warn her to lead humanity to explore other worlds. Ironically, we see this warning at the beginning of the film, before the voyage even begins. It doesn't make sense then, but for my money, it never makes sense at the end of the picture either. Somehow, Cooper doesn't age, yet his young daughter appears as an old woman at the end. Again, it has something to do with Einstein's Theory of Relativity – and therein lay the problem: Nobody understands the Theory of Relativity! All the longwinded scientific explanation of the cast (which eats up most of the dialogue) sounds like a bunch of existential mubmo-jumbo from the original ""Star Trek"" series. It's impossible to follow, due to its complexity, yet it's impossible to suspend disbelief, because the plot is so outlandish. Coming on the heels of Alfonso Cuaron's far superior ""Gravity"" last year, ""Interstellar"" pales in comparison. Much as Stanley Kubrick did in ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" Cuaron managed to nail the silence of outer space. ""Gravity"" was a quiet, reserved film, which highlighted the loneliness of space travel. ""Interstellar"" is blaring and assiduous – like a semi-serious ""Star Wars"" crossed with the garbage science of ""Star Trek."" ""Interstellar"" is an old-fashioned Saturday matinée, revved up past power ten with top-notch actors, IMAX special effects, and a music score that just won't stop. ""Interstellar"" is so big and expensive, it was financed by both Paramount and Warner Brothers. It's movie-making on a grand scale. And at that level, it fails. It might have worked, had it simply been stripped down a notch or two. And it's probably just me, but I have a problem with the name. Why would anyone choose an adjective as the name of a movie? Interstellar what? Where's the evasive noun? Probably sitting on the cutting-room floor with Einstein's Theory of Relativity."

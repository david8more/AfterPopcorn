0," Explanation Post
","Hello again folks. I enjoy leaving reviews for these mind twisting movies. Here I will do my best and explain the timelines of the 4 major characters. All characters go through a RED timeline and a BLUE timeline. RED is moving forward and BLUE is moving backwards in the RED timeline. I hope that makes sense. Here we go!1) The Sator Timeline. When he's a young man he finds a box while working in Russia. The box contains gold and the BLUE technology. He's on a mission to find pieces for a doomsday devise that wipes out existence. The last piece he needs is missing. He threatens Kat's life with the Protagonist. He uses the Blue technology to recover the missing piece. He now has all the pieces for the doomsday device. He than goes back to the day on the yacht in the RED timeline. The day where Kat sees SOMEONE dive off the boat and says he disappeared.2) TheProtagonist timeline. After the opening opera scene he is tortured, passes a test, and is recruited. He learns of the BLUE technology. He gathers information to lead him down the path and finds the missing piece for Sator. After Kat gets shot he then uses BLUE technology so she can heal. She can heal in the BLUE timeline because she was shot with BLUE technology. Only way to come back to the RED timeline was through another BLUE and RED machine. Only one he has seen was at the airport. So the Protagonist must get them back to the RED timeline using the airport BLUE and RED machine. Protagonist then goes back to the day of the yacht in the RED timeline. Where they remove the doomsday device before the explosion.3) The Neil Timeline. Neil helps the Protagonist in the now RED timeline. Not Neil's RED timeline but the Protagonist's RED. They find what they need to find. After Kat gets shot he goes into the BLUE timeline and along to the airport to get her through the RED and BLUE machine. He then travels to the day of the yacht in the BLUE timeline. As he is in the cave he sees another BLUE and RED machine. Knowing that they caved in the tunnel with explosives he needs to be at multiple places at once. So he then travels again through the BLUE timeline to intercept the Protagonist's failure so the Protagonist does not fail. He gets killed in the process. Keep in mind that when he went through the BLUE twice one of his selfs had to go to the RED timeline. This is where he meets up with them at the end. This is where the Protagonist realized he's dead and it was him who saved him at the opera house in the beginning.4) The Kat timeline. When she meets the Protagonist in the movie it's in the RED timeline. She tells a story about the yacht and she see a woman dive off the boat, the woman diver is herself. Later, Kat gets held hostage by Sator in the RED timeline. Sator is in the same timeline but in BLUE. After the Protagonist saves her they are both captured. Protagonist captured in RED and Kat is captured in BLUE. After she gets shot she heals (Airport scene). She then heads to the day on the yacht in the RED timeline. She sees her past self leave the boat with her son and sees Sator leave in his helicopter. Ok this where it gets tricky... Sator comes back but it's not the RED Sator it's the BLUE Sator from the highway scene after he got all the pieces from the doomsday device. The RED Sator left and the BLUE came back in the RED timeline. She kills him. She always killed him. She said earlier at dinner with the Protagonist that she saw a woman dive off the boat and her husband had disappeared. She killed him and slid him off the boat with the lotion she put on his back.Whatever happened was always going to and did happen. Neil says that a few times. But it wasn't until the end where he says it doesn't mean you should sit around and do nothing about it. Kat always kills Sator that day, Neil always dies that day.I hope that clears up some confusions. I did my best without going into the smaller details. Please react if this was helpful or not. Thank you reading those that made it until the end."
1," Necessary to watch twice, preferably with subtitles.
","Its somewhat ironic that a movie about time travel can't be reviewed properly until your future self rewatches the movie.It's bold of Nolan to make such a thoroughly dense blockbuster. He assumes people will actually want to see Tenet more than once so they can understand it properly, which some may not. This movie makes the chronology of Inception look as simplistic as tic-tac-toe.Ergo, it's hard for me to give an accurate rating, without having seen it twice, as I'm still trying to figure out whether everything does indeed make sense. If it does, this movie is easily a 9 or 10. If it doesn't, it's a 6.It's further not helped by the fact that the dialogue in the first 15 minutes of the movie is painfully hard to understand / hear. Either they were behind masks; they were practically mumbling; the sound effects were too loud; or all of the above. The exposition scenes are also waayyy too brief for something this complex -- a problem also shared with Interstellar actually.(Interstellar had this minimalist exposition problem explaining Blight, where if you weren't careful, you'd miss this one sentence / scene in the entire movie explaining that Blight was a viral bacteria:""Earth's atmosphere is 80% nitrogen, we don't even breathe nitrogen. Blight does, and as it thrives, our air gets less and less oxygen"").I guess it's a Nolan quirk. Hopefully, a revision of the film audio sorts the sound mixing out. I do like the soundtrack, but it's too loud initially.I liked all the actors. You think John Washington can't act at first, but he can, and he grows on you as the film progresses. And Pattinson is his usual charming self. Elizabeth is a surprise treat. And so on.Its worth a watch either way. See it with subtitles if you can. And definitely don't expect to fully understand whats going on the first time around."
2," I think I'm dumb
","Well, I've always known I was a little slow to the party but this movie was hard to follow! It might have been the cinema sound mix but my wife and I kept asking each other what they were saying.. the script was hard to hear let alone understand in its abstract form.. we got the gist of the concept but was still hard to piece everything together in the end! I think it's a movie that requires a few watches to wrap ya head round it, but then again i am a little slow.. lol"
3," Loud and impenetrable
","A man on an international mission to save the world from the deadliest weapon of all, the future.Two moods: excessive incomprehensible exposition and LOUD incomprehensible action sequences. At no point do you know what is going on, nor are you given any reason to care. It is at all times tedious, meaningless and irritating. None of the characters are remotely interesting, much of the dialogue is inaudible and the ridiculous convolutions add up to nothing. And this cost over $200 million to make."
4," Why does a film need multiple watches?
","As the first scene of Tenet came to an end, I looked at my partner and whispered, I'm lost. I'm lost and I don't think I'm ever going to get it.And I was right. What followed was two and a half hours of just an unreal amount of exposition that was distorted by music of SFX. If a film has to be explaining stuff to it's audience at the two hour mark then you've gone wrong. Plain and simple, I don't care if you're Christopher Nolan.Everyone I ask afterwards says that I will get it on the second, third or fourth try. Why does a film need multiple matches to understand it? Nolan is a huge advocate for his films to play in cinemas, which is great, but he must be detached from reality to think that most audience members can afford to go see the same film countless times, with the increasingly expensive movie tickets.Regardless of that, It's good that it was an original idea. But my god, if an unknown filmmaker had turned in this script to a production company, I'm pretty sure they would have thrown it away after 10 pages. The premise is cool, the effects are cool, but that is what you expect from a Nolan film. What I'm also coming to expect is a convoluted plot, terrible dialogue, and a film that will still hit over a billion at the box office."
5," Disappointing at first watch, Masterpiece at second. Just a little bit loud
","Its one hell of a complicated film. It will be very hard for an average viewer to gather all the information provided by this movie at the first watch. But the more you watch it, more hidden elements will come to light. And when you are able to put these hidden elements together. You will realize that this movie is just a ""masterpiece"" which takes the legacy of Christopher Nolan ForwardIf I talk about acting, Then I have to say that Robert Pattinson has really proved himself as a very good actor in these recent years. And I am sure his acting skills will increase with time. His performance is charming and very smooth. Whenever he is on the camera, he steals the focus
John David Washington is also fantastic in this movie. His performance is electrifying, I hope to see more from him in the future. Other characters such as Kenneth Branagh, Elizabeth, Himesh Patel, Dimple Kapadia, Clémence Poésy have also done quite well. And I dont think there is a need to talk about Michael CaineTalking about Music, its awesome. I dont think you will miss Hans Zimmer's score. Ludwig has done a sufficient job. There is no lack of good score in the movieGotta love the editing and post production which has been put into this movie. I think its fair to say this Nolan film has focused more in its post production.
The main problem in the movie is the sound mixing. Plot is already complex and some dialogues are very soft due to the high music score. It makes it harder to realize what is going on in the movie. Other Nolan movies had loud BGM too. But Audio and dialogues weren't a problemMy humble request to everyone is to please let the movie sink in your thoughts. Let your mind grasp all the elements of this movie. I am sure more people will find it better. Even those who think they got the plot. I can bet they are wrong."
6," Confusing
","I have honestly never felt so confused after watching a film, a lot of people saying watch it twice but I couldn't put myself through that again.
The idea is good.. but they have made it far too complicated, a bit pretentious and unfortunately no real heart to any of the characters. Disappointed."
7," Vrummmmmmmmmmm brummmmmmmmmmm
","Background music is so loud, and most of the actors mumble their lines. Guaranteed headache and impossible to understand the plot."
8," Lots of potential, but chaotic and at tee end, unsatisfying
","I am a big Nolan and Sci-Fi fan, and there's no question serious effort went into this movie. No question, the visuals were great, the acting was great, but the editing, PLOT and over-all effect was simply unsatisfying.The plot is full of discontinuity and random plot elements, and the main time reversal issue is never adequately explained, resolved or identified, and even the cryptic ""Tenet"" keyword never seems to appear outside of the trailer cuts. The most annoying aspect was the often incomprehensible audio, due to masks and bad editing, that made many key moments a total mystery.The plot is also littered with bad science of every possible kind, random statements that simply make no real sense (even using the odd time scenario) , and when viewed as ongoing story make you stop and say, how did we ever get HERE? The gun and bullet demonstration really sticks in my mind as total and complete cinematic plot garbage.I don't doubt this could have been a masterful movie, but unlike Memento or Inception, the script and story continuity were simply not up to the complex story task. The one word that sticks in my mind about this movie is disappointing. After the long delay, i really expected something a lot better than this. Maybe a later edit will fix this, but it certainly doesn't need to get any longer."
9," As a massive Nolan fan, this film is almost perplexing to the point where it's just plain ridiculous plotting.
",Listen we all know Nolan swings for the fences of what's possible and pushes the realms of normality. This film for whatever reason just doesn't mesh together the way most of his films do even with complex suspension of disbelief aspects. It's often scattered and juxtaposed to a near outrageous level. The visuals are spectacular at times but also seem way too extravagant to take seriously other times. Robert Pattinson is flawless and probably the standout of the film with his vigorous performance. The same cannot be said about John David Washington's barren and emotionless lack of effort. I can't believe he was given the starring role. He brings the interest level down to almost unwatchable levels. Overall this is one of Nolan's rare misfires which he is capable of once in awhile.
10," Confusing and hollow
","On paper, Tenet should have been as good as Interstellar and Inception. There are definitely similarities between these Nolan films - which in itself is not a bad thing as you know you're in for a challenging interesting and visually amazing experience. But there are 3 differences between Tenet and those films:
1. The cast and performances in Tenet are weak, and you just don't care about any of them. Washington's character just wasn't interesting and was pretty boring. Basic film making = make characters you can care about.
2. The dialogue is fast and quiet (the background sound is way too dominant) so within the first 20 minutes you're already not following what's going on. It's not the viewers responsibility to watch a film 3 times because the sound production dept can't do their job.
3. Visually boring. There was a blandness about many of the sets. Remember the Japanese house at the start on Inception? And the ""sea world"" in Interstellar? Tenet lacks imagination and everything looks boring.
4. Complexity in itself doesn't make a film interesting. Tenet is just too complex and isn't worth it. It's a quzzle you don't care if you don't solve. There are lots of film that don't lay everything on a plate for the viewer (e.g. Enemy, 2001 Space Oddisy etc) but they're WORTH it.For the first time ever, I nearly walk out half way through. I endured to the end and was glad it was over.I'm genuinely surprised that there are so many 10/10 rating for this. I'm pretty good at following complex films but Tenet is just tediously complex.There are some good things about Tenet (Pattinson and Brannagh's performances), but overall, Tenet is poor."
11," Pseudo-intellectual mindless action/WASTE OF TIME (movie also speaks in CAPS LOCK!)
","Big Nolan fan here. Doodlebug, Memento, The Prestige, Inception, Interstellar - all fresh and evocative stories. Needless to say, the bar was high going into Tenet.I had already seen the first ten minutes some months earlier in a preview which had left me enticed for more pieces of a seemingly new Nolan-y brainiac puzzle.Unfortunately, this movie feels like a self-parody.It starts off well enough, and the backward visuals look interesting enough, but gradually everything starts to feel very gimmicky. The ""message"" isn't revealed until somewhere around the last fifteen minutes, and mostly as a sort of parenthesis or footnote, and by then I had sat through two hours wondering who the enemy was, what they wanted and why I should care (Sorry, but WW3 is way too abstract a term for me. How? Over what? Why? What is at stake?). The explanation felt cliché and exploitatively woke-y. In the film, the last lines were treated as a thought entirely unique and amazingly deep. Wtf? Did a high schooler write this?The ""inversion"" part felt like an excuse to do cool visual stuff (which felt worn out very fast) instead of a basis for the exploration of a theme through story.The score felt intrusive, loud (my friend had to cover their ears in the cinema) and painfully on the nose. I bet a lot of the dissonant music came from some ""genius"" idea of playing melody backwards. Sorry, ranting a bit now, I digress...I watched my hope for a good story get crushed in non-stop action and chaos built around cardboard cut-out characters with no charm or personability. The actors seemed to be doing the best they could with what they had been given. The dialogue was, more often than not, laughable. Especially Debicki's character's lines were so cringe-y at times I could not believe what I was hearing.Glamorous environments, expensive clothing, global jet setting and VIPs carrying the fate of the world in their hands. Is this an attempt at trying to launch an updated modern Bond franchise?The film is competently made (cinematography, editing, production design etc), thus earning its five stars from me, but the story/execution is, I am sorry to say, sh**.This isn't a brainiac puzzle so much as a director lost very far up his own a**. Even Kip Thorne did not want to be associated with this nonsense!Contrived, chaotic, noisy, a director reveling in his own (convoluted) ""smartness"". Nolan, I have loved your stories in the past. Wth happened?"
12," Just wow, in a bad way
","Mind bending? Okay yes in a way its hard to follow whats exactly going on sometimes, but its so senseless in a way it hurts.The worst thing to me is the whole purpose. No smart evil plan to conquer the past, or make use of time travel features to stop climate change. No, Just a simple sick evil russian who will die anyway and wants to take everyone with him. The rest around the plot is his boring wife with her kid, we never actually see or care about. New people Just appear, dropping huge heists with Zero preperation. I know they did it already in a Loop multiple Times Blabla, but as a watcher its not convincing in that moment, not immersive, even confusing and clearing that up in the last 10 Minutes of the movie, doesnt make up for 2 hours of boredom.science not plausibleweak charactersstupid russian villain - American Hero, made up Story""mind bending"" stuff aside - just not goodtoo long (fighting scenes are used all twice..... because of the beautiful loop)sound horribletoo much pengpeng and no good dialogueLast 10 Minutes of the movie Twist ""Here the real Message of the movie"" - Like, now its a masterpiece because tada, timetravellogic all ....come onIm gonna watch it again! Backwards, and hope i get my wasted time back."
13," Complete mess ...... honest review
","Christopher Nolan for me is easily one of the greatest directors of all time and quite possibly the best director of the 2000's, so it pains me to say this......TENET is a complete mess.The attempt at explaining and ""weaponizing"" non-linear time theory just becomes wayyy to complicated in the film that it draws you completely out of the film. It creates such cheesy dialogue and by the 3rd act I just didn't care at all whether they win or lose. I just wanted tthem to SHHHH.Both out leading actors, tried their best, but they just were not believable in their roles. It was so bad that I actually fell asleep during the villains evil speech in the last act.And the idea of a algorithm in physical form I mean C'MON."
14," Absolute non-sense
","The movie started with a very intense ""Batman"" like opening. This movie showed promise the first twenty minutes and even though nothing made sense, there was still hope that it would all be tied together and all make sense. Unfortunately, hope was lost quickly and the plot disappeared into a endless past-future alternate reality abyss and never came back. This movie lacked depth and seemed pretentious from Nolan. A truly intellectual ""flex"" that surely he had no idea what was going on either. If there was one good thing from Covid is- very few people have had to sit through this disaster of a movie."
15," Overly confusing for the sake of it (spoiler free)
","Nolen tries too hard to be clever, all it does is lead to a overly complicated movie, full of plot holes.Nothing really happens, you feel absolutely no emotional connection to any characters, i couldn't have cared less if any of them died or succeeded, wasn't invested in any of them. No character development what so ever.Sound mix was terrible, i couldn't hear half the dialogue, and the action scenes were stupidly loud, my mother was covering her ears and said it was actually painful.Critics are rating it purley because its the great Christopher Nolen, and they are scared they'd be seen as stupid if they said anything other that this is an amzing film. I am not a Nolen basher, i love literally every movie he has done, and was very excited to see this, most disappointed i have been since IT Chapter 2."
16," A huge middle finger to the audience
","Christopher Nolan is my favourite director of all time. However this is an enormous banana skin of a film! Visually spectacular, but it falls way short on:General narrative and plot developmentCharacter development and any kind of emotional attachment to charactersPacing (It's ludicrously fast)Audio (Not sure what they did in post production to make it so bad but some dialogue scenes are almost incomprehensible).I felt angry watching the film, which is a first for me. Feels like Nolan is giving audiences a huge middle finger In trying to keep up, this film arrogantly revels in its own complexity."
17," Audio needs fixing
",The speech is very mumbled and not clear. The audio dialogue needs remixing and the background score and effects need lowering in volume. The character builds are non-existent. The plot is predictable. Action and special effects are very good but not ground breaking in this age when anyone can really shoot HD and then play it back backwards. Needs a second watch with sub titles.
18," Brief, Non-Spoiler review
","As this will be non-spoiler, I can't say too much about the story. However, what I can is this: Tenet's story is quite dynamic in the sense that you won't understand it till it wants you to. So, for the first half, your brain is fighting for hints and pieces to puzzle together the story. It isn't until halfway through the movie that Tenet invites you to the fantastic storytelling by Christopher Nolan.Acting is beyond phenomenal, and I'd be genuinely surprised if neither Robert Pattinson nor John David Washington doesn't receive an Oscar nomination for best actor. It's also hard not to mention how good Elizabeth Debicki and Aaron Johnson both are. All around, great acting, and the dialogue amps up the quality of the movie.The idea of this movie is damn fascinating, and while there are films that explore time-travelling, there's never been anything quite like this. It has such a beautiful charm and for the most part, explains everything thoroughly. It feels so much more complex than any form of time-travelling we've seen, and no less could've been expected from Nolan.Oh my lord, the score for this film fits so perfectly. Every scene that's meant to feel intense was amped by a hundred because of how good the score was. Let me just say though, none of them will be found iconic, but they fit the story and scenes so well.In the end, I walked out, feeling very satisfied. Nevertheless, I do have issues with the film that I cannot really express without spoiling bits of the story. There are definitely little inconsistencies that I found myself uncovering as the story progressed. However, I only had one issue that I found impacted my enjoyment. That issue was understanding some of the dialogue. No, not in the sense that the movie is too complicated, but more that it was hard to make out was being said at times. It felt like the movie required subtitles, but that probably was because, at a time in the film, there was far too much exposition.Nevertheless, I loved this film, I'll be watching it at least two more times, and I think most of you in this group will enjoy it. I definitely suggest watching it in theatres if possible, just so you can get that excitement.(4/5) & (8.5/10) for those that care about number scores."
19," Pretentious action movie
","If you find movies with nameless characters pretentious, this will fit nicely into the pattern.Not only the protagonist is nameless, but he calls himself The Protagonist- how hilarious. ROFL. The Protagonist is the new James Bond, but not as funny. His story is a graceless mashup of Memento (reverse playing) + Inception (sharp-suited men moving in designer's environments) + Dunkirk (boys club of fighting and running around aimlessly).The Protagonist and his sidekick Neil also do a bit of time travel, to stop an evil - obviously Caucasian - enemy from destroying the world. Evil guy's name is Sator, and there's is also a firm called Rotas, somebody called Arepo and part of the plot takes place at the Opera.Once Nolan's done in trying to impress you with the Sator square, he adds the quantum arrow of time and reversing entropy, mixes it with the most banal female role you can imagine (a trophy, mistreated wife who loves her son very very much), a car chase, a couple of fist fights and an involuntarily hilarious and chaotic final scene involving a red and a blue team (Matrix anyone?).The ending involves a rip-off of Casablanca, with the two male heroes metaphorically kissing goodbye (or hello?) and more of The Protagonist being hyper cool.I understand Nolan likes 5 stars, slick hotels, luxury interior design, expensive suits and first class travel around the world. Also, he's not the sentimental type who can make you sympathise with his characters, but absolutely not giving a damn about any of them doesn't help enjoying this movie either, exactly because the plot is quite banal, but dressed up nicely with some smart - but condescending- gimmicks."
20," If you make a movie such that it is needed to watch it 2-3 time..
","..to fully understand, you better make sure that it is really worth watching it 2-3 times. And this one is not.
And I find very arogant to even propose the idea of rewatching it and even more, using it as a negation of all the negative critics."
21," The Film Has No Heart!
","Intelligence isn't how many books you can read or if you have a degree. Accurate intelligence is about how self-aware you are with your intuition and how loving you are to yourself and existence. Therefore, if your behaviour isn't changing, then you're not growing. Some people are so focused on technical knowledge but lack the big picture, and because of this, they're emotionally unstable and stuck in life. You can have all the technical expertise, you can be an expert in your professional field but have no idea of the big picture.Tenet is the perfect example of focusing on lofty ideas and concepts, and forgetting the importance of film, which is human behaviour."
22," Utter nonsense
","This movie may be glossy and pretty to look at but since it's utter nonsense it's difficult to care. The entire concept makes no sense. No characters to care about either, they are just there as set pieces."
23," Brilliant Film
","If you can, get to a cinema and watch Tenet.If you can, watch it in IMAX.If you can, watch it twice.The film takes reality and plays it backwards and forwards at the same time. A mind bending, action packed experience like never seen in cinema before."
24," The sound mixing makes the movie unbearable
","I wanted to love this, but it was impossible.I maybe understood 20 sentences in the hole movie.
The sound mixing was so utterly bad, that it could've worked as a 1920s silent movie, except that it was so loud you'd get a tinnitus.Actors where either muffled through gas masks or backward speak translated through walky talkies. On top everything was drowned in the phenomenal soundtrack.It was impossible to follow the complex plot.
I focused on the eye candy and hoped it would end without me taking hearing damage"
25," Tenet is built like a puzzle with a story that folds over itself enough times to make you believe the screenplay was built from origami.
","It's been a long and bumpy road to release but the blockbuster event of the year is finally here. While lockdown may have warped people's perception of time, nothing can quite prepare you for the brain-addling time distortion on display in Christopher Nolan's latest feature Tenet.From its heart racing opening to its dual-timeline finale, Nolan pushes the boundaries of how film is presented and meant to be consumed. Playing fast and loose with chronology, Tenet is built like a puzzle with a story that folds over itself enough times to make you believe the screenplay was built from origami. Put simply, the film demands numerous viewings to untangle its interwoven narrative and will undoubtably attract a myriad of interpretations.Tenet also arrives at a time where cinemas are facing an uphill battle attracting audiences as they begin to reopen around the world. Luckily, Nolan has never been one to compromise the ambition of his films by doing things by half-measures. With its operatically staged action sequences and Ludwig Goransson's pulsating soundtrack, Tenet is a complete sensory overload that offers a cinematic experience not to be missed."
26," Christopher Nolan does it again
",One of Christopher Nolan's most fascinating movies yet . The inversion concept is unique & outstanding. The performances are excellent. The cinematography is super. Some scenes are simply breath taking. It's a visual art. The action and practical effects are incredible. It does require a lot of concentration and possibly multiple watches.
27," Be patient
","If you are expecting the adrenaline you got with Inception, look no further. If you are looking to be able to follow this film on the first viewing like you did with Inception, maybe not so much. I would put this film one level higher in complexity than Inception, as Inception was complex but pretty intuitive. This film CAN be intuitive, but unless you want to wait for the Blu Ray, you're going to have to shell out to see it multiple times to actually get a better understanding of the plot's finer points.
A more logistical thing to comment on: it seems the audio mix is lacking. I originally thought it was my theater (voices seem to carry too much bass, making them hard to understand; however, Studio Movie Grill plays this film very, very loud, which I love because it makes the gunfire far more realistic), but others have complained about this as well. I am hoping that the blu ray will be remastered so that this is not an issue.
With all this being said, be patient. This film is great and I have a strong feeling you will not be disappointed. It is classic Nolan doing what he does best. It is intricate, spares no expense, and it is by no means lazy. Once the BR comes out, it may actually turn into one his his best so far."
28," It didn't work this time.
","I love the work of Mister Nolan, but it didn't work this time.
The film lacks of pace and charisma. Sometimes it's boring to keep watching.
Maybe he tried to hit the originality of ""inception"", but the editing and the story didn't help.
The sound mixing is really good as always and the Kenneth Branagh's performance is the highlight of the movie.
Some fights scenes are close to childish execution.
Anyway, I hope Nolan does better in a near future."
29," Naive action film
","This is an action film packed with fast-paced fight scenes and rapid plot twists. But the film is disappointing in every respect. Most importantly, the plot is uninteresting and the characters are simplistic and shallow. The sci-fi twist of the story is ridiculous.The men are of simple man's-gotta-do-what-man's-gotta-do types. And women are portrayed as usual in Hollywood films: beautiful objects, caring mothers, or vengeful lovers. None of the characters appear as real human with cognitive depth. There's no discussion, no reflection, no personal growth. The plot relies on naive narratives: the hero must save the beautiful girl, the mother will do anything to save her child, the betrayed lover seeks for a revenge, the omnipotent antagonist wishes to destroy the world due to personal vanity. What's new, Nolan?The pseudo-scientific idea of reversing the time is yet-another crazy Hollywood plot twist that does not have any scientific basis. As a scientist the film makes me laugh. It seems that the action genre as a whole has been completely exhausted, so the only way to create something ""new"" (and to keep the viewer from falling asleep) is to make the cars run backwards.Some people think that the film is interesting (""masterpiece"") because the plot is complex and you cannot spot all the details on the first watch. Well, I did spot most of it on the first watch and ... it was not interesting. The story is predictable and does not provide any new ideas that haven't been dealt with in previous films. The underlying philosophy of the future of the world and righteousness is naive and simplistic."
30," Biggest waste of money on a movie
","This is the very first and last review I will ever leave for a movie.Never did I leave the movie theater so frustrated and confused in my life. I really wanted to like this movie and I usually try to never be too critical of a movie, but there was no part to which I could cling on and say there was something positive and great about it.Even if this movie is deeper and has complex themes which are interesting, your brain shouldn't be overloaded by attempting to comprehend every single second of the movie. It is way too heavy and everything moves way too fast for an effective analysis.The sound and music were waayy to loud to the point that my ears hurt. I literally didn't understand half of what the characters were saying which only worsened the confusion. Subtitles would have been necessary.There is very little backstory to any of the characters, and I didn't care for any of them due to a lack of great acting/ character development. What made Nolan's previous films so great is that it explores the complexity of the characters and their motivations. Here, you're just thrown in the action from the very first second with almost no explanation of each and everyone's purpose in the story.You should at least understand the majority of the concepts after you finish a movie. Here, you'll probably need to re-watch at least another time to start understanding the plot a little bit more. However, I'm not planning to waste another 2.5 hours of my life on this movie.Here's my reccomendation: don't waste your time and money on this film, you'll save hours of life."
31," Nonsensical and infuriating
","At first sight, this movie was nonsensical and infuriatingly bad. However, since I watched the movie a few days ago, I have carefully reconsidered and re-examined the latest Nolan. I have come to the conclusion that it is easily one of the worst movies ever made, confirming my initial intuition. I tried to find some good but couldn't find any.The dialogue: horrible and cringe.
The sound mixing: ... Oh boy
The acting: yikes
Action: pretty ridiculous and unconvincing
Plot: nonsensical yet somehow still predictableDon't do time travel and try to explain it scientifically. Don't pretend you 'get' this movie, there's nothing to get here. I wish this movie was never made and I wish Nolan could be held accountable for making such trash."
32," Christopher Nolan does James Bond -- with time travel!
","I have a huge amount of respect for director Christopher Nolan. His recent films Inception, Interstellar, and Dunkirk are three of the best things I've ever seen on film and I automatically want to see whatever new production he comes out with. So, I'm just back from the theater having seen Tenet for the first time (I'm pretty sure there will be a second and third time) and in one sense I have no idea what rating to give. At a minimum it would be worth at least 6/10 for its technical quality alone. But it might be 10/10 for the quality of its fiendishly intricate storyline, which leaves your head spinning by the end. But it' s not without a few problems (see below). So, OK -- 8/10 it is.Among Nolan's previous works I'd say 'Tenet' owes the most to 'Inception' for its complex, ever-shifting, multilayered plot. For Inception it was the Russian-doll dreamworlds within dreamworlds. For Tenet, it's playing with time and time reversal (as you see from any trailer or synopsis out there). We've had any number of time-travel movies before, and one sure thing they're good for is setting up paradoxes, but the way Nolan deploys this on screen is at times genuinely and startlingly new (as just one example, there's a car chase on a busy freeway where one car is speeding backwards but time-reversed, so from its POV it's racing forward, which is why it can travel that fast driving backward ... and there are many more scenes that I won't spoil.) There are things here we've never seen on screen before.In the barest of bare-bones summary, the plot is all about a hunt for The Algorithm, something that enables this messing with the timeline The uber-evil Andrei (Kenneth Branagh) aims to use it to start WW III, or even (in a total burst of nihilism) ring down the curtain on all of reality. The shadowy team called Tenet aims to stop this. Keep up with it if you can. On the surface, it's an excellent James Bond imitation. Exposition scenes are followed by thunderous action, rinse, repeat -- pretty much from start to finish. How confused you are at any given moment depends (like Inception) on how many questions are running through your mind: why are we in THIS location now, who's doing what to whom, and what precisely are the characters after? The overall impression, though (again, like Inception) is that there IS substance underneath the high-octane surface and that repeated viewings and study will bring it out. We'll see.So the production quality is, as usual for Nolan, first-rate. There are big, bravura scenes (wait till you see the big opener in a concert hall) but plenty of close, person-to-person ones to balance. One thing that might be a little jarring is that the scene-to-scene transitions are extremely abrupt and extremely frequent, and I assume that's deliberate -- there's no time for viewers to think even if we want to. But I'll accept that as a feature rather than a bug. The overall flow isn't necessarily helped by the music score (by Ludwig Goransson), which is epic but also insistent and omnipresent. Too much of a good thing. Lots of the personal scenes would just have worked better for me with no background score stepping on the dialog.For the acting: I thought John David Washington (as The Protagonist) was OK but rather wooden, and he's on screen most of the time. I kept visualizing Will Smith in the part instead -- but maybe he'd have taken over the movie too much and that's not the result Nolan wanted? I don't know. But I liked Robert Pattinson and Elizabeth Debicki quite a lot. They both have substantial, essential roles and they have more nuance and humanity than anything they've done before. Kenneth Branagh still can't do a good Russian accent (though to be fair, not many native-English actors can) and although he's fine, I think as an actor he's much better suited to Shakespeare or Hercule Poirot. There's a big cast of smaller roles (among which is the always-welcome Michael Caine), adding to the difficulty of keeping up with what's developing.So there it is. I'm looking forward to figuring out more of what's under the hood of this thing."
33," Worth it- but intensely cerebral for 2.5 hours with no break in tension
","I respect the cinematic art that is Tenet. It's just something you experience- and if you try to follow the plot it will be confusing. But in this case, that confusion is intentional and one thing is obvious, this film is an intentional well planned out vision of Christopher Nolan. That confidence and certainty of a director is what you respect. Many great filmmakers make strange mind bending films. I think the action in Tenet was entertaining and the concept was interesting. But I feel it came up short given the storytelling ability of Christopher Nolan.I think a top tier director like Nolan has a responsibility to level the tension. A film that's super intense for 2 1/2 hours straight is stressful. The audience has to do a lot of work to try to figure out what's going on and it's exhausting. You need to pull back and let some of it simmer. I think Nolan has entered the echo chamber stage of his career. No one's going to tell him no, or that somethings not right.**this paragraph doesn't have spoilers per say, as no one knows what this film is really about- but it you haven't seen the film, spoiler alert. I feel the Indian lady (aka oracle master weapons dealer) was flat and her entire subplot could have been cut out. And I wished the opening opera scene tied into the plot more- and I think there was too much plot being revealed through dialogue. The actors were having to explain the plot- and it still didn't make sense even to them! HahaI did enjoy it. Judging on a Nolan curve, I would give it a B+. I think it's probably his fourth best film. They will probably shower it with Oscars, but 10 years from now I don't think anybody's going to be quoting Tenant or talking about it, because it's unclear what it was about- without having it explained to you in a director's commentary. And Inception and Interstellar both played with time better than Tenet.Even though it was clearly visionary, a unique piece of art that plays with the rules of the medium and the backwards action stuff was innovative... in the end, the bad guy wasn't charismatic enough and the good guys were too busy explaining the world to each other, and the ending wasn't amazing. But it was highly entertaining and that's all you can ask for."
34," Two and a half hours of noise
","Whilst I admired the cinematography, the backing soundtrack and music was too loud, sometimes louder than the dialogue.
Two and a half hours seemed to go on and on with not much happening, a lot of repeating itself?
Perhaps I am that average film goer and should stick to Eurovision.
The six people in our screening stayed very quiet.
I liked the Michael Caine cameo appearance."
35," Extremely Disappointed
",I'm a massive Nolan fan and love Inception which I was hoping this was going to be like but it's nothing of the sort and very poor! The story isn't that complex once you finally find out what's happening but for a Nolan film I expected far better.
36," This movie rewards you for seeing it again.
","I'm not gonna lie, first viewing was a big letdown. As a Nolan fan myself, I was shocked to see what I considered ""annoying bad"" writing and sound design. The sound design still is a problem as of writing this, but upon second viewing, it was like a little switch flicked on every time I saw something I didn't understand from the last viewing. The little details that I considered bad writing suddenly seemed like an obvious answer. The cheesy parts I thought were, well cheesy, had so much more depth. I'm not going to spoil it, but thinking about The Protagonist and Neil makes me feel so many emotions that upon second viewing never made me feel the way I did, truly beautiful. No movie is perfect, this one definitely isn't perfect. This is no Dunkirk or Inception, but I guarantee this movie will make you use your brain."
37," Overcomplicated to disguise pure nonsence
","Tell me, if everything is going backwards, should't they speak out the words and sentences the same way - backwards? But no, they speak normal laguage.
And if you think about logics and details, it's the same - it's only flaws in there.
Acting is okay, though, and visuals are great. But if you are looking for sense, it is not the case."
38," If you are into movies, Tenet is your jam.
","If you want to enjoy a real, interesting film which does tribute to many genres and film-making techniques, as well as screenplay styles, then TENET is a great choice.
Overall, this is an outstanding filmmaking effort by Nolan and Co. There is almost no green screen mambo-jumbo, real stunts are a fact and you can enjoy a plot which will keep you thinking what the hell is happening at 50% of the film. Rewatching is also fun; I had the pleasure to watch it in IMAX twice (it's all shot in IMAX cameras btw), but when it goes out on DVD, I ll watch it at least 1-2 times more to delve into the intricate plot that Nolan made.
Kudos to the score, it really coated the action and the entire film in a fantastic way, keeping pace at all times.
I don't think I have seen something similar before in terms of non-linear filmmaking and although I was very confused at start, I got into it halfway through and that was very rewarding.
9/10, good solid film."
39," Impossible to follow, pointless drivel
","This movie was worse than a disappointment--it was a frustrating mess of a puzzle that I came to hate watching as it grew more and more complex. The point of the story is finding out what the story is about. About 30 minutes in I no longer cared because it was so incredibly confusing that I had no choice but to give up on it.I could barely hear what the characters were even saying as they casually and all-too briefly brushed over super essential exposition in low monotone voices in between a mindless grind of nonstop moving parts. That went on for the entire movie. Blink and you'll lose track of the plot because it makes no sense in the first place.If you want to just watch something unfold for the heck of it and would rather not spend even a second reflecting on any of it while it happens, this is your movie. In fact, if you prefer zero character development, zero emotion from anyone in screen, and basically zero point to the story other than to crunch through some occasional bizarre action scenes, this will be a gem to you."
40," Confusing as hell but feels all right
","It really confused me when I watched it yesterday. I can honestly say that I probably missed lots of details even though it came around in the end and settled nicely.
I am sure that people who dive into the details will find these bits and pieces and time will help to digest the whole story.
No matter you hate it or love it but you have to admit that the movies from Nolan are simply so innovative which the current movie industry simply cannot reproduce. He writes the story itself, he directs, chooses the actors, the locations and he mainly uses real world setups instead of computer generated ones. He is so creative and luckily does have the financial background to complete his plans.
I think the main flaw of this movie that the viewer can feel unsatisfied at the end due to the complex setup and this brutal backwards mechanics."
41," Pretentious and Boring.
","I've enjoyed many Nolan films (seen the Batman's several times and loved Inception) but he really disappeared up his own backside with this one.I've heard interviews where Nolan claims to have spent a lengthy amount of time over several years devising the plot for this. If that's the case then how does he expect an audience to unravel the plot in two hours and enjoy this?There did not seem to be any character development. I felt little or no empathy or interest in any of the characters. It felt emotionless and cold, confusing and I couldn't wait for it to end.People have said it improves with repeated viewings but it made me so aggrieved at the first viewing that I'm not going to waste my time with this again.This seems to be a similar situation as with Tarantino - whereby nobody can seemingly say 'No' to him, which has resulted in this nonsense.I get the sense that Nolan thinks he is challenging his audience into sparking some mature, intellectual or philosophical debate. However, he's completely missing the point by continually trying to deceive the audience.Absolute Guff! I hope they don't let him anywhere near Bond."
42," Tenet is neither mind-bending nor brilliant. But it'll keep you entertained
","To all the fans out there: please, don't downvote my review just 'cause I dared to give a 6-grade to a movie directed by Nolan. Read it first, thank you very much.OK, so, what is there to say about this ""Tenet""? Well, first and foremost, lemme tell you that the movie isn't ""bad"" in any way, shape or form. In a blockbuster world populated by ""Avengers"", ""Transformers"", awful Disney animated classics' remakes and the likes, you can't seriously go around sayin' that ""Tenet"" is bad entertainment without being scorned. It's definitely passable entertainment.But its director is really, really sly, and being such he managed to convince a lot of people (and especially a lot of critics) out there that he created a very profound and complicated movie, when in fact he did not. 'Cause ""Tenet"" is pretty much a Bond movie going backwards half of the time. The plot is really that simple and predictable - half an hour into it and you'd already grasp pretty much everything there is to grasp. I'm not being arrogant here, please believe me: go watch the movie and you'll realize that yourself. Guaranteed. Now that we have put that aside, I'll go on by laying everything out plain and simple:PROS:Great direction. That's a given: Nolan knows how to put the camera to best use and knows how to keep you hooked most of the time;Effective soundtrack. It's not by any chance memorable, but it nonetheless contributes a lot to the movie's overall atmosphere;Dark cinematography. Again, very effective and in line with the movie' ""serious"" tone;A couple of great action sequences. And the ""backwards special effects"" are really a treat to behold.
CONS:Mediocre dialogues and screenplay. I mean, a lot of times the dialogues are either cringeworthy or purely explanatory (and the bad guy has the worst lines of them all). On top of that, the screenplay tries the best to conceal its simple narrative, but can't quite manage to convince you that it's phenomenal and brilliant, or that in the end it's isn't just a matter of a banal spy story. And - by the way - the overall theme is too close to blatant fatalism for me to like.Cardboard characters. Every single one of them is a total ""spy movie"" cliché: from the ""Protagonist"" to the ridiculous villain. They're completely underdeveloped and so there's no chance that the viewers can indentify with them.Unconvincing main actor. Of course he's isn't on par with his father Denzel - but that's obvious. The problem is that he also isn't on par neither with Pattison nor especially with Branagh. Really a bad casting choice over here.Lack of pathos. You're not gonna feel any empathy towards the characters ('cause, as I said, they're not actually characters: they are puppets, cardboard puppets with no interesting personalities). Nolan himself doesn't seem to care about that, lost as he is in his ""entropy gimmick"".
Here you go. In conclusion - to sum it up - I'd say that ""Tenet"" is definitely a movie to be seen on the biggest screen possible. It's a decent blockbuster full of every kind of action and vaguely intriguing in its premise. It's also - however - let down by a predictable storyline and mediocre dialogues. It lacks pathos and presents us with a main actor who is not really that good. But at the very least Nolan with this new movie is trying to do something different from the majority of other big budget productions and we gotta hand it to him. Anyway, his movie isn't by any standard a great one.
That's all I had to say. So long folks, and may the ""Sator square"" be with you!"
43," Surprised by tenet
",I wasn't sure what to think of tenet as my friend promoted it more than I had considered it but it ended up being a cool movie a bit confusing but I liked the performance
44," A Shallow Ego-Trip From A Once-Great Director
","Christopher Nolan is one of the most interesting filmmakers working today. Unlike so many directors who began their careers outside of Hollywood and then moved to Hollywood for mainstream success, Nolan has maintained creative control over his work. Moreover, his interests in the concept of time and the medium of non-linear storytelling have persisted from the smaller movies he cut his teeth on at the start of his career to the big studio flicks he is known for now. It is one thing to make cutting edge movies on a small budget, it is another to transition into making big budget movies that are accessible to the mainstream and it is yet another thing to be able to continue to push your trademark themes and aesthetic sensibilities throughout your diverse body of work. For that Nolan deserves to be commended.Unfortunately, Tenet is a heartless and charmless affair. This may very well be an example of an auteur getting swallowed by their own ego and losing sight of what made their movies great in the first place. Christopher Nolan has made some great movies over the course of his career and a lot of his movies are founded upon unique story-telling components. But the thing about Memento, with its reverse-order narrative, or Inception, with its dream-within-a-dream plot points, is that these story-telling components were just that - devices to tell a story and expand on the characters. For all Inception's plot twists and major action set pieces, the movie was held together by the pathos surrounding Leonardo DiCaprio's character who was grieving for his dead wife and the movie had a resounding message about letting go of the past and living in reality.With Tenet, the story-telling components are gimmicky and, although they come together to tell a complex story, I lost interest around the 90-minute mark. What good is a sophisticated plot if you care nothing for the characters? This movie, like a lot of Nolan movies, is built on one big, speculative concept which requires you to go with it to a large extent. But there is little effort to really make you invested in the characters or the world before that concept is introduced.Early reviews are praising John David Washington's charisma, but I can't say I saw that myself. Washington isn't bad, he does the best with what he's given, but his character (who is known simply as 'The Protagonist') is under-developed. There is also praise coming for Robert Pattinson and I will admit that Pattinson's performance may be the highlight of the movie, but that isn't saying much. Like 'The Protagonist', Pattinson's 'Neil' is a mysterious character without any clear back-story or motivation. A movie could work if one of the two leads were like that - but not both. Perhaps if they made Washington's Protagonist more grounded and relatable, then Neil would work with his wry, Christopher Hitchens-esque, mystique. Alternatively, if they gave Neil a fleshed-out backstory and motivation then he could have served as a focal point for the audience to see the more sublime Protagonist. Instead, both characters are effectively superheroes with ultra-competence but poorly fleshed out development and motivations.Reviewers will undoubtedly note the action sequences and the special effects of this movie - which are impressive - though I feel that Nolan could have heeded the 'less is more' principle a bit more. By the end of the movie I was so worn out with the action and trying to keep up with it, that I was no longer impressed by the visuals. Instead of staging these complex action scenes, greater emotion could have gone into them to get us to feel the stakes. Then again, what are stakes when you care nothing for the characters?"
45," Easily one of the worst movies I've ever seen
","Movies are about creating an experience for a viewer, to create feelings, whether positive or negative. In order to do that, you need to have some understanding of whats happening, and you need to care about the characters. In this movie, I had no idea what the story was about, and what the characters wanted.I love, I loved inception despite its flaws. This movie has all of inceptions flaws made into the main course. It's almost as if the movie outright hates its audience. Even in inception, with its lack of human characters, you still kinda cared for Cobb. When he reunites with his kids, you feel lit, and you understand his motivation. In this movie, you have none of this.I've seen bad movies, but this movie fails on the basic foundations of what a movie needs to be, to be entertaining and valuable. I almost fell asleep a few times"
46," An unexpected work from Christopher Nolan
","An unexpected work from Christopher Nolan
Well Christopher Nolan is undoubtedly one of the best directors, but Tenet is a big problem!
At first I'm not even sure how to write a review about this movie! Complex, strange and annoying at times, and I cannot even tell if the scenario is smart or is it just complicated?
On the positive side, the acting was perfect, especially in terms of Robert. And his acting is perfect. This is clearly his best movie ever.
There are other features such as music, photography, etc. However, the movie does not match the rest of the great Nolan films, but it is not bad so I will rate it 8 out of 10."
47," Tenet Review
","Clémence Poésy character says in the film ""Don't try to understand it. Feel it."" And later Pattinson character ask to the main character ""Does your head hurt yet?"" While he is trying to explain part of the plot to The Protagonist and to us as an audience, this is basically the whole movie, visually is great, the score even being loud is also great, the concept of moving backwards is also a great idea that give a lot great scenes, but when you stop to realize, a lot of things don't make a lot of sense."
48," Unnecessarily complicated, way too long. Very disappointed considering all the hype generated during last months
","I had big expectations for Tenet, since I first watched the trailer. Instead, the movie is very confusing and maybe in order to understand it, I need to watch it more than once. I managed to follow halfway through it, but then I was completely lost. Except the main two characters Neil and The Protagonist, the rest of the cast is pretty flat and Kat is really annoying, especially towards the end. At least actors were good enough to maintain the whole thing afloat.From a technical perspective the movie is good, and there are a few good scenes here and there, but I would say that special effects were cheap and lazy. I mean, from a visionary director such as Nolan I wasn't expecting for sure a bunch of reversed clips. The ending had no sense at all and you cannot actually understand what is happening.If this is the movie that was supposed to relaunch cinemas, after the lockdown period, well, I suggest to look elsewhere. Tenet is unoriginal and uninspired, Nolan already made movies about space and time such as ""Inception"" or ""Interstellar"", so I think that in this case he could have change the topic.A real pity. Movie's definitely too long and there are many stretched out sequences and useless story lines. Instead of deepening some details, which could actually make understand something about what's happening. I suggest to give it a try, but do not expect a masterpiece."
49," The director and producer must have been on LSD And stoned for the making and completion of this movie
",Was there ever an actual good idea for this movie? If there was it was 100% lost in translation. One of the most frustrating and ridiculous movies I have ever seen. And the music over the vocal audio all the freaking time is plain stupid. Not only is this movie not worth paying for it's not worth your time to watch it for free.
50," Massively overrated.
","Why should a English language film need subtitles, this one needs it, why do you have watch it twice, because it's laughable confusing, this is a joke, incomprehensible, the only thing it proves is that you can rewind film, we know that, I have an IQ 139, I love good movies, but this was a headache, between the incoherent narrative and the unbelievable plot, it's a turkey, don't buy into the rhetoric that it's somehow special , it's not, it's annoying that's all."
51," Another one..
","Christopher Nolan? The man who keeps delivering.. I feel so stupid after seeing his movies the first time, but yet I'm still so impressed. He makes a movie, which I love, but not quite understand completely. I can't stop thinking about it and after some hours, I slowly start to make sense.Tenet was terrific, even tho my brain felt blended."
52," An absolute masterpiece!
","At first, I want to ask Christopher Nolan one question, HOW THE HELL YOU DID THIS?
Seriously I want to have an answer, How did he write such as this masterpiece!
How did he get this complicated, fabulous and creative idea? What is going on in his mind?
The story is written and directed perfectly, the narration style was absolutely unique.
I have no idea how can anyone direct such as this story, that was a huge challenge, and as usual Nolan gave us a masterpiece that we'll put beside (Memento), (Inception) and (Interstellar)
The movie is so fast-paced in a good way, there was no boring moment.
The chemistry between John David Washington and Robert Pattinson was great and funny and both of their performance was really good.
Elizabeth Debicki performance was the best in the movie because she had the chance to show her acting abilities and she cached up that chance and showed us an A level acting.The music wasn't unique and distinct as the music of Interstellar for example and I think this movie needed the touch of Hans Zimmer, I'm not saying that Ludwig Göransson failed but Hans Zimmer in another level.If there was something I'd say that I didn't like it in the movie would it be that Nolan discarded any set up or characters backgrounds except Elizabeth Debicki dramatic story but it wasn't that bad for me, I didn't care about that, the exciting story didn't give me the chance to focus on it.
But the actual problem was the third act, it was really complicated and I got lost and I convinced myself to discard the questions that were in my head and enjoy the well-made action sequences and Elizabeth Debicki performance.I think this kind of movie that gets better with a second and third watch."
53," Give it a chance
","Upon entering the cinema to see this film i had my doubts; previous reviews i'd read did not suggest that this film would be enjoyable upon first time watching. A claim which i believe to be untrue! This film is more understandable than expected throughout many of its parts and does a good job of focusing the viewer's attention on details which are important to the story later on. Whilst a second watch will only further this understanding, I personally feel this is not a necessity. However, this film is a challenge to follow perfectly and I'm sure that most viewers (including myself) will leave questioning certain details. The sound mix is also not as bad as many suggest and is only noticeable in energetic action sequences which may be a choice to immerse the viewer as I'm sure it is hard to hear clear dialogue whilst bullets are flying! If you have the attention span and like a film that challenges your understanding of the world then this is definitely worth a watch!"
54," Makes sense and gets better with second watch
","So, after coming back from the cinema from watching Tenet for the first time, I was feeling such a buzz but at the same time if somebody had asked me (which they did..) what was it about, I would have just had to answer: no idea. Second time watching, it was so much clearer. The time inversion, going backwards and forwards makes sense and is logical. In fact, it's very cleverly thought out. Christopher Nolan does it again in that he makes something that just should not work actually make sense. You just have to give it time. And preferably watch it with subtitles. Just like a lot of his films, not only does it makes you want to talk about it, think up theories but it's also a great cinema experience.As for the rest of it, again typical Nolan. The music was so effective, it made me jump up in my seat with the tension of it along with the great directing. There were a lot of great shots (I mean seriously, wow), very spectacular scenes and the cinematography was on point. The acting was good even though it was less about the characters and more an ensemble piece/plot driven. Despite people having problems with the muffled dialogue, it personally didn't affect me.All in all, I would definitely recommend people to watch this film; the first watch for the amazing look and thrill of it and the second watch for the clever plot.Very good 8/10"
55," I Loved It!
","It is complicated and can be hard to hear and/or understand all of the dialogue, which can be an issue when trying to absorb all of the crazy ideas included in this story, as well as connect to the characters. That's my only reason for not giving it 10 stars!You do have to pay attention to everything and even then you'd probably have to watch this one a few times to get all of what it has to offer.I loved the visuals and the score and music throughout. The idea was ambitious which I always appreciate. Robert Patterson and Kenneth Branagh were fantastic in their roles."
56," So bad it hurts
","I felt like this movie was giving me the finger the entire time - saying ha ha you'll watch anything won't you! None of the dialog makes any sense, the acting from the leads is terrible, the music is awful and the sound of gunfire pierces your ears and you often can't make out what anybody is saying half the time. The characters are all awful people. What made anybody think anyone would want to watch this? The strangest thing is some people are saying this is a masterpiece of cinema, which I don't understand."
57," Visually stunning, but mind-numbingly complex.
","I'll admit: I probably have to watch this movie again. I'm usually pretty good at unraveling a Christopher Nolan movie when I watch it for the first time. Not since Memento (2000), have I had such a difficult time piecing together the intertwining timelines. At least with Memento, I was aided by the black-and-white sections. In Tenet (2020), time moves in both directions in the same scene. Sure, this is a visually-stunning feat, but it's often a slap in the face of the Grandfather Paradox, which Tenet simply waves away with a shrug and a ""don't worry about it.""What's interesting is how moments of foreshadowing in this film triggered my ""lightbulb reflex"" each time the corresponding portion of the plot came into focus and gave me the ""aha moment."" I'm sure I'll pick up more of these when I watch it a second time. As it stands after a single viewing, my mind was exhausted by the end as I tried to keep track of everything that was happening. Sure, it helps when the movie revisits a few key scenes in forward and backward time (thus giving the audience more time to piece together everything).I think the main issue I had with this film was how it was trying so hard to sell the ""time travel"" concept within the standard action film framework. Why did the antagonist want to destroy the world? Narcissism, probably-which isn't that strong of a motivator in my book. I'm sure this would be the type of film Nolan would make if he tried his hand at the James Bond franchise. As it stands, I feel there are some logical plot holes that weaken the movie as a whole. Sure, I love the amazing Inception (2010)-like visuals but unraveling such a complex idea like this only caused me to ask more questions.Visually stunning, but mind-numbingly complex, I give Tenet 4.0 stars out of 5."
58," Don't try to understand it feel it!
","Tenet is the latest Christopher Nolan film starring John David Washington, Elizabeth debicki, Robert Pattinson and keneneth Branagh.
I can't and I don't know how to explain the story. it's a movie that you have to watch it at least twice and I'm going to rewatch it this week. All I can tell you is this is an awesome well made spy/sci-fi movie that you've never seen. Just watch the trailer and go to your local theater.
The first thing that got my attention into the movie was the music oh my god! The music score of this film is incredible. It's an instance film every action moment is instance! but as soon as music starts you're into the movie and this time ludwig goranssson did the soundtrack who also did black panther and won an Oscar for that and also did a few more movies soundtrack and this was his best one imo. The casting choice and acting is great but the Characterizations is a little bit weak not just this film almost the most of the Christopher Nolan films characters I don't care about them Me and the most of the audiences mostly care about the storyline and the things are happening during the movie. Most of his characters are like video games characters and the audiences are the gamers so to watch and understand his movies you have to use your brain as your gaming controller imo. I love the fact that Nolan always avoid green screen and try to use practical effects and that makes the cast performances and action scenes 100 times better and real. And that's why this was by far my best cinematic experience in a movie theater I felt like I was in the movie. Overall it's an awesome well made film that is totally worth watching and paying in cinemas even twice! It's complicating it's crazy and that was everything I wanted from a Nolan film even more what I was expecting! This is one of his best works for the past decade and also one of the best movies of 2020 and this decade. I liked this more than inception. My score for tenet will be a 9/10 for now I may change my mind after second or multiple viewing."
59," Engaging, thrilling, confusing, complex, inaudible
","It's a really good film, however, it's overly complex and the sound mixing is awful, you can't hear half of the dialogue."
60," Built For Long Term Curiosity
","Trying to take my bias opinion away from my critical, logical opinion. Few people comprehend the immense detail with the story, I don't even comprehend all of it, but now I understand enough to believe that this is Nolan's most elaborate story yet. This is a complicated movie, and complicated in a good way. If you (as an audience) don't enjoy or understand this movie I understand why and I don't blame you, but on the contrary if you do enjoy this movie, if you understand the story, then I understand why you may believe this to be one of the most intelligent films of all time. (BOLD claim). We already knew what to expect with the quality of cinematography, visual, score, and even to a certain extent, the wild plot that Christopher Nolan ALWAYS delivers because he's consistent with all his films. What we received with this film though, was simply unexpected. This wasn't a film like the dark knight which provides authenticity to a sci-fi world, or even inception which provided clarity after simple attention. This is a film that is intended to be searched, discovered, thought of, looked at, and inspected in every way possible. And yet, this a film intended to give no easy answers, no simple clarity, no instant gratification. This is a film that wants to defy the odds of films by building curiosity over time rather than losing it. Overall I have a lot to discover, a lot to learn, and a lot to understand from this film, yet I'm extremely pleased with its performance in most categories a film has to offer."
61," An Intriguing, Creative Spy Thriller
","An intriguing, fast-paced, and creative spy thriller. It has an interesting concept for you to wrap your brain around that kept my brain stimulated for the duration. I saw a lot of people say they thought it was overly convoluted, but it felt fine to me (although those I watched it with disagree). Maybe my advantage going into it was I could hear the dialogue alright (many complained about the audio mixing) and I could keep up with everything going on in the film for the most part. But, I also could be missing much of it while not even realizing it. It's hard to know, because analyzing one aspect of the movie requires you to wrap your brain around the entire thing at once. I also saw some complaining about the exposition, but it was definitely necessary and it flowed fine for me.While still a solid movie, I think it would have been better with more fledged out characters. The only character we really got an in-depth look into was Kat. The rest of them were written generally the same as most protagonists and I feel the film could have benefited more from their persons being explored. Also, while the movie was fast-paced and action scenes were fun and innovative, I felt the urge for more gritty, brutal fight scenes rather than the many times we were given simple headlocks. While holes (or the opposite: more aspects coming to light) could become apparent to me on a rewatch, for now this sits in my mind as a solid action film. Certainly not Nolan's best, but certainly more unique and captivating than most blockbusters.7.6/10"
62," You'll probably need to watch it twice
","Not as much action in the beginning, the time traveling stuff kinda confused me, I understood it basically but felt like I really had to pay extra attention to this movie, I know I'd probably like it better a second time that's why the rating it so high. The main character has a couple of REALLY bad jokes, that's my main complaint with this movie. The time traveling stuff is cool it just takes a while to get there"
63," Incredible concept
","This is a masterpiece with intense but not too loud music. In response to some comments and critiques: Even as an English learner and while eating nachos socially distanced in a major theater I was able to follow the plot and concept without any problems. While some were quite obvious at a certain point, I still loved every twist and turn. Despite its runtime not a second felt wasted and it mostly cut right to the chase. Best action and most innovative storyline I've seen in a long time."
64," Some messy ideas shouldn't become films
","Ignore the fake 9/10 and 10/10 reviews most likely coming from the actors. Tenet is a complete and utterly nonsense.1) ridiculous plot;
2) impossible to follow, but not because of some complexity of the plot (it is quite simple) but because the plot is empty;
3) no character development;
4) boring dialogues;
5) actors obviously confused about what exactly they are playing, which makes it all even worse.Not worth watching even once. Better to rewatch some movie you actually like."
65," First real disappointment from Mr. Christopher Nolan
","Greetings from Lithuania.I just came back from a premiere of ""Tenet"" (2020), a hugely anticipated new movie by Mr. Christopher Nolan - my favorite director. I'm a huge Nolan's fan, saw all his movie in a theater and they all left me speechless and i even consider ""Interstellar"" as my favorite film of this millennium - i'm a real Nolan's fan boy.And with my broken heart i can only say after seeing ""Tenet"" that it was a first real disappointment by this brilliant director. This time Mr. Nolan has outdone himself, and not in a good way. Story and plot were a mess. Its not ""Inception"" by any means - that movie had a very simple idea and plot which was put into this intriguing world and concept - it wasn't difficult to follow because you always knew exactly what was the goal, who is who and etc. ""Tenet"" does not had any of that. While i enjoyed the plot for a around first 40% of its run time, later its just become so convoluted that farther it went the more i was scratching my head and eventually started to rolling my eyes when Robert Pattinson's and John David Washington's characters were describing the plot to each other, jumping for and between, reading between the lines and etc - it was simply way to complicated and eventually convoluted. By the end of this movie i really didn't care what was going on nor did i tried to understand - the movie's plot and storytelling lost me completely. Its not Nolan ""the director"" who wasn't good here, but its Noland ""the screenwriter"" who i think overdone himself this time, and not in a good way. The good things in this movie were for me performance by Kenneth Branagh who was excellent villain, cinematography and basically all the production values in this movie - they are first rate. Unfortunately plot and storytelling were below average - they just didn't for me at all.Overall, unfortunately the year 2020 was a terrible year not only because of the virus, but also it was a year when we got a first flop from Mr. Nolan. Its not that its a bad movie, like i said production values are first rate but other then that you will be scratching your head in disbelieve of how convoluted and cold this movie is. For his next feature Mr. Nolan should slow it down with plot and maybe take his brother as writer to help - together they can put plots and screenplays like no other. ""Tenet"" unfortunately is not the case."
66," Cliched and disapointing...
","Well, so much for my favorite director.
I used to like pretty much everything he was coming up with. Yeap, including Dunkirk. But, it seems to be true: all good things come to an end.
The characters are not likable, the motivations are confusing and inconsistent, at times even not believable. The story is full of cliches, event includes a communists-forced bare-hands-plutonian-picking Soviet children turn oligarch...
Uninteresting.
Disappointing."
67," 100% a must watch
","I'm speechless!
I don't know what to feel after I watch this movie..
The cinematography, the story, the score - everything about this movie is finesse at it's finest!
Definitely a must watch!"
68," Christopher Nolan's Grandly Entertaining, Time Slipping Spectacle Is a Futuristic Throwback
",Best comback of Christopher Nolan after Dunkirk . It's marvelous. The fresh inversion concept is simply outstanding. The performances are great. John David Washington is excellent and Robert Pattinson is cool minded done a mature performance and rest of the cast have done a superb job. The cinematography is super. Some scenes are simply breath taking. It's a visual treat. Th action is also very good.
69," If you don't understand it doesn't mean the movie is bad
","If you don't understand a movie and have a feeling that it is good then instead of giving low rates, why don't you watch it again and try to understand more?Satoshi Kon says: ""Movies that you can watch once and understand entirely -- that is the type of movie that I don't really like. However, if you are able to understand 70 to 80 percent of what's being relayed, and there's still some percentage left that would allow for your own interpretation . . . that's the type of movie that I do like. There might be a certain part that you don't quite understand, but there is a portion that rests in your heart.""It is a shame that the audience profile has been changing and this movie will get a lower rating ratio than it deserves.Note: I really understand the bad reviews based on the sound problems. I have watched it three times in three different theaters. The first had no problem with the sound, the second had a problem which is very small and the third one had a very bad sound problem. My point is that probably some of the theaters didn't test the sound because the sound should be lowered. It is not because of the movie since I watched once with no problem. Actually, it is a problem for some theaters. They need to decrease the level of the sound probably the decibel level is too high for their speakers.Additionally, I understood the movie during the first watch. The problem is that nowadays watchers are not careful anymore. All the clues are there! You just don't wanna see."
70," The Emperor Has No Clothes
","Had high expectations but the movie is long and boring. It had such an confusing plot that tricks you into thinking the movie is ""actually good"". Had few good visual scenes, not compelling enough to make it up for the one fifty minutes. Went to see John and Robert in a film, assumed it has to be great despite what's being seen on the screen. It's quite slow paced, nor suspenseful and hated the sound mixing, too loud, especially in the action scenes, unable to see the movie due to that is just unforgivable.People are giving 10/10 ratings and praises, ignoring the plotholes and obvious flaws cause directed by Nolan. Think they're doing him a favour but we have to call out such things, else we keep gonna get mediocre movies. I'm sure because of blind fanaticism, same people not gonna find my review helpful, either. Original rating is 4/10, giving it 1 for balancing the high rating."
71," Mindblowing, epic and very very original
","I loved the cinematography and the epic scale of this movie, it's been a while since i watched some original cinema. concept is very original, i loved the action in reverse and the way it filmed on this epic scale males it the perfect visual treat. Hats-off to chirstopher nolan for this epic action movie."
72," Bad in every possible way. But sound mixing is awful.
","I have only seen this once, and have no plans to see it again to 'understand' it better.The dialogue is so muffled, I could barely understand a word anyone said. Michael Caine had one scene and he had to talk with food in his mouth for the entire scene. It was a deliberate directors choice to garble all words.Not just in that scene, but in all of them. When they were having a conversation, they had removed all the structure words (the, and, a) and just had a ""baby talk"" conversation using long scientific terms that they didn't understand themselves.If a conversation ever started to make sense, he would cover it with loud music and aeroplane noises. So loud, I literally had to cover my ears it was hurting.The mix was dreadful. One moment it was super loud, then the very next they were mumbling in whispers. I never experienced such a bad sound mix as this.As for the plot? Again, it makes no sense. Gunshot wounds don't ""heal"" in reverse time. You cant just make up nonsense stupid plot devises, that make no sense if they have three hours to get to a hospital. THREE HOURS!There is more, but this film is so bad I have better things to do."
73," Edge of your seat
","Great movie, very fast paced and you need to keep up! Loved it."
74," It's ok
","The general plot is comprehensible enough to enjoy the movie, try to dig a bit deeper into all the intricacies and you'll probably lose yourself really fast. The movie's premise is actually interesting, but at some points it gets a bit tiring trying to connect all the dots. Nolan's movies tend to think they're smarter then they really are (a big problem I had with interstellar), and this one suffers from the same problem, but 2.5 hours passed relatively fast, I can't say i didn't have fun watching it, however i don't plan on rewatching it."
75," Nolan Hits It Out Of The Park Once Agaian
","While the rest of the world is at its knees, Australia is doing well enough to have half compacity cinemas, which means I get the pleasure of watching Tenet a week before most of the world.As a self-confessed fanboy of Nolan and his films I came into the cinema busting at the seems with excitement and expectation, I was not let down in the slightest.Tenet's first half has the viewer scrambling their brains trying to comprehend what is happening, from exotic scene to the next your senses are bombarded left and right. It isn't until the second half of the film that it all becomes clear and you understand the true brilliance of what Nolan and his crew have put to the screen.Its hard to keep this review spoiler free because everything about the plot has been hidden and so little has been shown in trailers. While I am not claiming this is the greatest film ever made it certainly is an adequate distraction from the current situation the human race finds itself in.I highly recommend viewing this film in theatres at least once, (even though it will probably take you 2 or 3 viewings to fully grasp all the intricacies like it has for me); I feel like the full experience will be missed if your first viewing is at home like many Nolan films before it.KidKuubrick."
76," Mindblowing, but maybe a bit too much for me.
","The first part of the movie was relatively easy to grasp what was going on, with me being able to keep up fairly well with how the story was unfolding.However, an hour in or so and the story started to really accellerate with a pace I couldn't keep up with. I could not process every bit that was going on any longer, leading to further questions raised in my head the longer the movie continued.In the last part of the movie, some questions got answered and started to make sense, but still the vast majority of questions and uncertainties remained.All in all, I definitely need to watch the movie another couple of times to try and grasp certain passages I simply couldn't after watching it the first time."
77," The 1st of Nolans worst movies
","I love psychological questioning movies. Particularly Nolans movies. But wth was this?! And it's not like I'm slow at picking storylines up. I'm a clinician with a masters. It's been put together to deliberately have you in a state of confusion, I suspect like the protagonist, with the anticipation of it all clicking together half way and you sit back in your seat thinking 'woooaaahhhh!' But it just leaves you confused thinking where the hell are the filmmakers going? Instead you end up critiquing each aspect of the filmmaking and miss out on enjoying the movie. Not that there was anything to enjoy. I get the movie but it just felt...stupid.The soundmixing. I mean nobody could hear any sentences bar 5% from each one. If there was ever an example to show sound engineers how not to put sound mixing together, this was it. 50 times worse than the first 10 mins of dark knight rises.Acting - Pattinson holds it well as you'd expect, but wasted because of the freaking music constantly being played when he spoke. The protagonist, this dude has no facial expressions. Coming from BAME background I'm really annoyed that not a better actor or actress was used who could pull me into each of their scenes or just even make it a bit more of an interesting watch. Someone who could show fear, anger, worry etc. Lupita Nyong'o? Thandie newton. Oh and I'm male btw and not a feminist.I'm going to do the home covid test now. But if I end up testing positive, I'm seriously going to be incensed at getting it after risking my 1st cinema outing in 6 months on such an abysmal movie."
78," Can't Properly Rate if You Can't Hear
","I wish I could give this a better rating, but when only half the dialogue is audible it's impossible to follow the plot. Left confused and disappointed. Will have to wait for subtitles to watch again. As released with the horrendous audio mix, it's a 5."
79," Easily the worst Nolan film
","Being a huge Nolan fan I anticipated this release. I think everyone of his films (exluding the mediocre third batman) is a masterpiece. Unfortunately this time he got everything wrong. First of all the script, though based on an interesting idea, is all over the place. Nothing is explained or completed. I struggled for the first hour to understand what is happening and then I stopped caring. And that brings us to the second fault. There are no characters, only puppets with no backstory or evolvment arc, muttering Nolan's ideas like ""text to voice"" wikipedia. The music is very annoying, most of the time covering the actors voices. The actors try to do their best with what the were given which is not much. Well...with the exception of the completely talentless protagonist. Hope this mess is the only low point in Nolan's filmography."
80," You won't get it the first time.
","If I'm being completely honest, the first time I saw this movie I quite literally thought the theater's sound system was messed up. But when I got out I looked it up and found that the movie just had this painfully bad sound mixing. Dialogue was very difficult to understand the first time I watched it but the second time, I understood it better. I even asked the front counter for the caption glasses they provide, I wish I got them the first time.The acting was spot on, I believed the characters were the characters and not the actors (well obviously Michael Caine was a bit difficult but you know what I mean). The actors were perfect for their roles.Soundtrack fit perfectly throughout the entire film, but at some parts, as I stated earlier, it was way too loud and you couldn't understand the dialogue as well as you would like, which is a shame because the dialogue is pretty crucial to the understanding of the movie.All in all, I'm happy I watched it a second time, because I definitely knew what to listen harder for. Christopher Nolan, while sometimes a bit too full of himself to let the audience understand dialogue, has an insane mind to be able to think of the things he thinks of for his movies. Would definitely recommend you watch, but not in IMAX, it's a bit loud."
81," confusing at first but everything make sense in an incredibly way
","Nolan's movies never disappoints me. This time, i think he didn't do the explaining part well that left the audiences confused. However, he still fools us all and continue his unique spirit that no one has."
82," Interesting
","Very interesting idea in movie. Its funny how some people say it is complicated story, yet it was very normal for me to watch and very easy to understand, even predict alot of stuff that happened. Anyway, fun movie, nice action, very good plot."
83," TENET is Mr. Nolan's Wild Ride!
","TENET is Mr. Nolan's Wild Ride!
The special effects and real-time location shots are some of the best of Nolan's career, James Bond-like and brilliantly photographed in a time sequence format by his cinematographer, Hoyte van Hoytema, who worked as DP on 2 other Christopher Nolan films, ""Dunkirk"" and ""Interstellar."" These are reasons the film should be seen in the cinema, on the big screen, to be truly appreciated. Took 2 stars off (8 out-of 10) because, while I understood the concept of TENET, Saving the World and International Espionage, the plot is the most challenging to follow of all Nolan's movies. The film moves so quickly, so much going on, that plot points were missed in this first screening of the movie. In true Nolan fashion, as with some of his other films, TENET will require multiple viewings to discover what was missed and to fully comprehend the story. Fine performances from John David Washington as Protagonist, Robert Pattinson as his past-present-future partner Neil, Elizabeth Debicki and Kenneth Branagh who makes a great villain, and a cameo appearance from Nolan muse Michael Caine."
84," Have to watch twice to understand what is happening.
","This was the first film I watched coming back into the movie theater during the pandemic. I absolutely love Christopher Nolan as a filmmaker, and always look forward ot his films. However I will admit this film was just not it for me. I loved and appreciated the interesting and new story concept but I had no idea what was happening. I recommend this film, and still need to go back to the theater to watch this film twice."
85," Excellenet 💯
",My rating says it. Just needed subtitles to grasp it completely.
86," Made me want to go back into lockdown
","This movie is in short, way too long, way too complicated, to the point where i left an everyman cinema. Its tried to be too clever for its own good, and the plots are plentiful but not explained as the movie moves through so many.
The fight scenes are awful.
The acting is at best average, and some of the dialogues are just garbage and childish nonsense.
Paid 15 quid at the everyman cinema, best bit was the icecream sunday i ordered."
87," The Embonpoint Of Christopher Nolan's mind.
","'TENET'.
What does it mean?
Chris Nolan sharps up a complex,intriguing vision...and goes deeper within the inversion of matter and time. From a filmmaking standpoint,the film is flawless. It's massive and brilliantly written. It is surely,a piece for the times. The best of the best."
88," Definitely the best movie of the year
","Yes. Nolan did it again, repeating his own style he created another masterpeace! Plot of the movie is so complicated that even Inception is like a joke compare to TENET. That's the main reason why I love Nolan, he makes you really think about the plot. It's obvious, you can't understand Nolan's movies from one-time watching, so I'm keeping my ideas this time.
Recommended 10/10"
89," A decent time-manipulation sci-fi movie
","Beautifully done, and they got the time-stuff correct, with only minor contradictions. Or those contradictions may just be me having missed certain details. It went a bit too fast, the names and the context. And it was too loud sometimes."
90," The first time you watch it, you'll wish you could hear the dialog. The second time you watch it, you'll wish you'd never heard the dialog.
","There was a time when I was a huge Nolan fan. The Prestige is still one of my all time favorite top ten movies. Yet the more movies Nolan makes, the more the luster wears off.Most of of Nolan's movies have some psuedo-science schtick you're asked to take with a leap of faith. Tesla's machine in Prestige. The gravity beings in Interstellar. Matroshyka dreams in Inception. See the pattern here? At his best Nolan is a supremely polished Abrams or Rian Johnson: more interested in advancing his vision than offering substance.Tenet is not his best.A review I read said that Tenet's problem is that Nolan has reached a level where he doesn't have to listen to anyone -- there's no one to pull him back and tell him something isn't working. Tenet is that ultimate conceit.It's a time-jinx movie that only explains half the rules... and then breaks all of them. Inversion is a gimmick that's used masterfully exactly ONCE. The rest of the time it's just smoke and mirrors to distract you from the fact that there is no reason to the movie, that it's characters are cardboard thin, the dialog is terrible, and at it's heart it's just a cerebral wannab-Bond flick that doesn't get the cerebral part right.Congrats, Mr. Nolan. You lived long enough to see yourself become the villain."
91," Quite spectacular
","Early in the film one of the characters says: Don't try and make sense of it, just feel it. So that's what i did, and thankfully so. If you see this movie for the first time, and you try and make complete sense of the plot without having a doctors degree in astrophysics, your head will probably hurt. Your first viewing should be to just pay attention, and let the movie guide you forward (or backwards), don't try and put all the pieces together, because you can't. This is Nolan doing what he does best, which is manipulating time.It's a complex new film from Nolan, which previously has played with time in several of his films, but in different ways every time. From Different speeds in Inception and Interstellar to different time windows in which a story unfolds in Dunkirk, and the back and forth in Memento, Nolan seems to be obsessed with time. And by sticking to his guns as he calls it, he manages to make movies that looks like nothing before it. This is yet again, a movie only Nolan could have made.What i truly liked about this film is how Nolan from the very beginning show us hints about what's to come, but we don't yet know it. But when these small hints and sequences are finally revealed as the plot moves along, it's incredibly rewarding. It proves that he is a master of manipulation, which is a skill he truly needed to make this film, and movies like The Prestige. I'm not going to go into specifics how time works in this film, but it's a new take, from the trailers you already know it has something to with time inversion. Time that is moving backwards.For decades scientists have been discussing time, and how it works. For us humans, time moves forward. But does that mean it does that for everyone, or every thing? No. In quantum physics, there is no time, things move in all directions, and we humans are made up of atoms, which then does not move in one direction. But yet, we feel it that way.This movie's plot is anchored in these laws of quantum physics. Just like Nolan also used laws of physics in Interstellar for example, to describe how a spinning black hole can slow time so much that 1 hour close to it, equaled many many years on Earth. So even if Tenet for many people, won't make any sense, just see the movie for the first time with an open mind.If you can just enjoy the spectacular action sequences, the constant tension, the pounding music and the beautiful cinematography, this movie delivers pure and solid entertainment.I tried to put myself in Nolan's shoes after i saw this film. I thought to myself, if i had come up with this story, i would likely have doubted myself on every turn, because i could not let go, the amount of ifs and buts would explode my cranium.But I felt i understood the time trickery quite well in this film, and i enjoyed the entertainment for what it was, and i think it's one of the best action films, probably the best so far, this year. But i also felt like this movie was missing something, it might be a lack of character development, in which this movie has almost none. It might also be that i took a close look at some of the scenes closer to the climax, which was without doubt very difficult to coordinate and film, but i saw several mistakes.But all in all, what a spectacular film. Nolan is the only one in the industry that can make a film like this. It's just a bit sad he values plot and action more than connection with the characters, in which this movie needed a little bit more.8/10"
92," Watch out for the Dangly Bit
","No spoilers, but the dangly bit is important.The first time I watched Tenet, I noticed the dangly bit once, understood half the plot, and rated the film at six out of ten.The second time I watched Tenet, I noticed the dangly bit twice, understood two thirds of the plot, and rated the film at seven out of ten.The third time I watched Tenet, I was actively searching for the dangly bit. I saw it three times, understood about three quarters of the plot, and have given it eight stars.I do have a question though. Is making a film you have to watch multiple times to make sense of it a sneaky way of boosting the box office takings?"
93," An expression of Nolans mind
","Firstly, on an IMAX screen this movie looks incredible and the sound is powerful. The action sequences with reverse entropy are groundbreaking and work into the fabric of the story and action really well. The thought of people running backwards sounds 'silly' however Nolan pulls it off effortlessly, the first scene we see this done really grips you into the movie and from that point on you are locked in for a great ride.As always Nolan has a complex story which in many ways like inception and memento leaves the audience to fill in some of the very strategically left blanks, which will keep you thinking long after the movie has finished. He gives his audience enough respect not to turn this movie into a science lesson which allows plenty of room for action.Overall this is a very smart, stylish action packed movie with a detailed story that delivers superb cinema."
94," It's seems to be underrated by other critics
",I am shocked at how low a critics score it has. I have seen the movie twice and it's an amazing experience. I think if shall we say more movie fans went to see this movie it would be 8.7 or 8.6 at least.
95," Mass Confusion 101
","Wow. Seriously, just came back from a viewing of this & can tell for 2 hours & 24 minutes I never understood a single bit of this film, that's how much of a mess it was. Hell I can't even explain the synopsis never mind what the film is about it's that bad.Typically this film has got good ratings! Pfft, paid reviewers at it again while the GP takes a back seat in the dark. The fake reviews get catapulted into the public eye while the GP ones only get seen here. Pathetic. How about explaining how the film was like it is? Why lie & say it was good when it wasn't. I can tell you now you'd have to be a Grade A tip top geniuses or have a Masters Degree in confusing plots of films to even understand a gist of this never mind the whole plot. How ANYONE can understand this tripe is beyond me.The plot makes no sense. It was like following a moving trains traveling in a Mobius infinity loop. It's simply impossible when there's is no obvious concise narrative as to what's what. What time they are, in what day it is etc. The plot was a mess & as if that wasn't bad enough you have the time travel crap mixed in, literally. There would be a scene where you were following the action then BAM! ""Something"" already happened & then the whole reversing of what already happened would occur then just fade off into nowhere, then later on you see the same scene this time from a different perspective where what happened is in forward motion & what was in forward motion would be in reverse in the background. Then when you'd see the scene from another perspective it turns out to be the same characters!? Eh!? I know it's suppose to be the alternate dimension but When? Where? How? & What? Even typing this out now makes my head ache with frustration!You'd understand (understand being a strongly stressed word in this case) the plot sort of then the rug would be pulled from beneath your feet when a ""This already happened"" scene would occur, cue more confusing time travel crap. Several scenes in the film would show ships, car going in reverse & it wouldn't be made clear what or when this was happening!The films dialogue was hard to get & understand. The muffled sound, over dramatic music & explosions didn't help. Like with the plot & narrative, the dialogue could've been more concise & easily translated to the audience.The characters were ok, the action was ok. But sadly the films confusing plot, muddle time travel scenes made it harder. This film really sucked hard & is typically overrated. Doesn't the writer & director understand that the film has to be made easy to follow? That's is the whole point in going to see a film correct? I've said it before & I'll say it again! MAKE THE FILM EASIER TO FOLLOW FOR CASUAL AUDIENCES! I mean seriously, not EVERYONE watching this film will be fans of your work! The films pacing & run time were ridiculous & only a secondary insult to injury problem with the film.Overall, DON'T waste you time with this crap. Take it from me a film goer who by the way notice beside him a group of lads laughing & raising their hands much like I did & thinking ""wtf"" every 5 minutes! The plot & narrative makes 0 sense. It's only muddier further with the time travel & plot points which frustrates you more with the film pacing & run time. By the time I got to 1 hour & 30 minutes, I gave up & the film felt like an absolute chore to watch from that point on! 1/10"
96," Interesting but at times very confusing
","It had to happen. I was not sure what to think about this movie, but I went anyway. It was a very strange and extremely confusing movie. ( my wife would have hated) Great special effects though no wonder it cost so much money. It was over all an entertaining movie but very long. However, It's not the kind of movie that you need to see on the big screen. You would be better off watching at home with the subtitle so you can understand what they are saying and maybe you have to rewind. A few times. The science was off but which made the movie more confusing plus made some of the sequence out of place and did not make senses. But it was a cool concept that is for sure. Denzel Washington son did a good job. It was a hard movie to watch at times. This kind of movie would do well in a tv series where they have time to explain and take their time develop the plot more. I give it 7 out of 10. Because of the special effect and an original story."
97," This aint no entertaining movie. Nolan shud stop his obsession with so called intelligent films n try making simpler films.
","The film gets very repetitive. The action is nothing but unnecessary chaos. The lead actor cant act for sure. His walking mannerism, his body language n his facial expressions r duds.
Better watch Terminator 2 or James Bond films.
The character of Priya n the shooting in Mumbai is added jus to attract pseudo intellectual viewers from my beloved country India.
The rote learned physics students from my beloved country will be in awe of this film.
Nolan aint aware that physics students in India need to work more in the laboratories to put the theoretical knowledge to use.
The wannabe critics from my country will unnecessary give this film more stars so that they dont look outcasts."
98," Music was too loud
",I would love to be able to give an opinion on this movie but unfortunately the background music was so loud that I couldn't make out a word the characters were saying. The beginning scene triggered my anxiety as I wasn't expecting that level of noise. No idea what this movie was about.
99," Definitely a movie you need to watch twice
","The movie is pretty convoluted and a bit hard to follow on a first watch. It will eventually click about halfway through the movie but its a better experience watching the movie once you have the knowledge from the first playthrough. Not Christopher Nolan's best work, but solid movie nonetheless. I feel like the protagonist wasn't very likable. Robert's character was the highlight of the movie."
100," So abysmal I couldn't believe it
",Anyone not ready to walk out on the hour point deserves some sort of medal for gallantry or endurance... It is utter crap
101," I loved it.
",I've just watched this tonight I'd heard a lot of reviews from its release mostly the sound which didn't bother me as I watch everything with subtitles. There are a lot of twists but most of which most movie fans like myself will predict but it was the getting there that I really enjoyed. I did find it a little slow for the first half hour while it warmed up and obviously any film that involves any type of time travel can be a rough watch for some. I'll definitely watch it again to see what I missed the first time as I know I've missed bits and Bob's. Definitely worth a watch in my opinion.
102," Built to entertain, not to explain time travel
","Tenet is not a usual movie that shows really well what Nolan has going for it.The music the action sequence the complicated but a masterfully delicate plotline is definetly something that gives an amazing cinematic experience if you can let go of either not understanding or seeing how something doesn't fit. Because I don't think there is anyone who can understand the whole of it on the go to understand every detail it requires more watches. Exposition which Inception was known for, is dialed back to not try to prove this scientifically implausible idea but make you get it. It explains the bare minimum to be able understand the plotline but it doesn't try to give you a strong explanation on the physics for a reason. It is implausible and the movie sends the director's message throughout the whole time to not dwell on it, get the plotline and enjoy the action.On the other hand it still ends up diving into the questions of fatelism, purpose and real heroes which gives it a decent deepness as much as it is possible for such a idea but can still fulfill some of our big question thinking.It's unique it's well-executed, it's not perfection but it is as much as the idea can be. I'm more of a ""plotguy"" and don't prefer action but it was highly enjoyable after just letting go of the plausibility. It's unique it's fun it's cinema, definetly worth a watch."
103," Total flop
","I have felt ripped off by this movie. I thought that being from Nolan would be fine, but its not a viewer friendly. It expels it from the film by introducing the science fiction element, which in addition to making the whole plot incomprehensible is ridiculous. We have always associated the forward scenes with movies or series of laughter. Nolan tries to build a James Bond movie with a science fiction element so the experiment doesn't work at all. Kenneth Branagh's role borders on ridiculous composing a comic book villain character.
To make matters worse, we have to swallow the same idiotic scenes twice, backwards and forwards.
It's not worth paying what a movie ticket is worth today to see this mess."
104," Masterpiece
","I will first start off by saying that my 2 favourite Nolan films BEFORE watching Tenet was Inception and Interstellar. Now Tenet joins the top of the list.To explain how good this film is without spoiling it. Is incredibly difficult. I honestly can't say much. This is something you really have to experience for youself.What I can say, is that...TENET is an action packed thriller, with many twists and turns that will make your head ache. Like mine is right now. I'm not good at reviews. But this film is Indeed a near perfect masterpiece.As just finishing it, I will give Tenet a 10/10"
105," A Cinematic Tour De Force
","Based on the assumption that entropy determines the arrow of time, TENET explores what could happen if entropy could be reversed, or ""Inverted"", for objects, people and even the environment around us. If we are rendering our planet inhabitable due to the excesses, wastefulness and ignorance of our generation and our predecessors, could our descendants want revenge and turn back the winds of time against us and erase our existence in an attempt to save their own?""A nuclear weapon can only affect our future. An inverted weapon might be able to affect our past as well.""TENET plays with the concepts of causality, free will and paradoxes. The film posits that paradoxes cannot be solved and that their consequences are unknowable. This is juxtaposed with the future's intention of annihilating the past, essentially creating a grandfather paradox. Perhaps, the people in the future have found a way to sidestep the paradox and create a different branch of reality?""Somewhere, sometime, a man in a crystalline tower throws a switch and Armageddon is both triggered and avoided.""In a race to stop the villain - an egotistical, abusive and dying man - from transmitting the location of ""The Algorithm"" - a device that can invert the entropy of our environment - to the people in future, the film takes its characters through multiple mind-bending sequences resulting from the puzzling implications of Inversion. The film takes some artistic license in depicting the consequences of inversion and treats the audience with several massive set pieces - unique in parts, accompanied by an intense score to spectacular effect.""That part is a little dramatic.""With the global threat averted, TENET ends on a melancholic note as the friendship at the heart of the film comes to an end (and also begins), loose ends are tied up and the world remains unaware of what could have happened.""No one cares about the bomb that didn't go off. Only the ones that did...""Although TENET packs too much plot for a two and a half hour film where everything cannot possibly be explained or understood by the audience on first viewing and it is easy to get lost into the intricacies of the mechanics of inversion, it is, nonetheless, a cinematic tour de force and a bold attempt at large scale, ambitious storytelling with a palindromic structure. Something we could use more of, for us and for our posterity."
106," Trying to be smart so hard, FAILED
","I don't want to spoil anything and because im pretty mad that I paid to watch this trash here it is.
Nolan is my favourite director, but in my opinion this movie is trash. It is trying so hard to be ""smart"", that is losing its point. For me, the main ""thing"" of the movie was obvious from the first 20 minutes. Also, there are insane plot holes (ex. oxygen, won't say more to not spoil anything). The scenes as well as the dialogue were ""trying so hard"" that it was getting confusing all the time.
When you try to innovate, sometimes you fail.
His worst movie. Period."
107," Omg.. It's way worse on the second watch
","I originally rated it 7 and thought I would like it more on a second watch... And after all the hype i had faded i did... And man I realized it's a horrible boring movie, cringy villain with cringy female character who does everything without any point other than to move the plot forward, the main idea gets dull pretty quickly and pretty impossible to understand fully.. Man after i liberated from all the hype i had the first time i realized how ridiculous and boring this soap opera was... I actually got mad that this was a freaking Nolan film.. The only guy I wait for his movies along with Tarantino... I'm so so so disappointed...
(edit) : if you guys don't believe me.. Let me tell somethings about the movie....
"" nuclear holocaust?...-worst"".....omg.. What?... ""if i can't have you no one will.""...cringing bad... "" i will do anything for my son""... Including killing the guy and causing the end of freakin humanity.... "" don't try to understand it""... Well there you go... Nolan says f you to your face....
Omg this movie is so bad... I can't blame the actors they kinda carried the whole thing and John David Washington would make a good James Bond.. They had to deal with immensely bad writing, script and characters... Nolan did a pretty bad job and made this movie for his own amusement and be we like him we hyped to it... An identical thing happened with Tarantino and once upon a time in Hollywood.. My two favorite movie makers went nuts"
108," .enoz trofmoc laropmet ruoy fo tuo uoy sehsuP
","The Nolan team don't skimp on the 'epic'ery of their films (although they may have to after the pandemic eats into the box office of this one).
It's not just a movie, it IS cinema.
It's like one, long advertisement for the new techno-fad of temporal flipping. They go about it as casually as a young technology sales person explaining the latest smartphone to you. You only kind of understand what they're saying but what they're SHOWING you is so cool you just go along with it.
It is a good film to help understand TIME as potentially the next great expanse to be explored.
There's a scene in Avengers: Endgame where they belittle concepts of time presented in Back To The Future and almost every other time-related sci-fi movie. Well, TeneT makes Endgame's own concept of time travel seem rudimentary.
Unique & interesting characters from John David Washington (3 names so gotta be good), Pattinson, Debicki, Brannagh & more!
Some of the most bizarre action sequences to ever unoccur on film.
Good."
109," Great movie
","What's with all the hates on this movie? I thought it was a great film and understood it after the first viewing. Very ambitious concept for a movie! Here is a trick, put down your cellphone and pay attention. I agree that it is complex but you just need to pay attention or it will be very confusing. If you miss 2 minutes of the movie, you'll be lost (keep your eyes on the screen). Dialogue only becomes an issue when they were wearing the masks. But hey, no one understands what I say when I go to the store wearing a mask during COVID-19 (reality I guess). Robert did an amazing job in a very mysterious character. John-David is awesome as the lead and keeps reminding me of his dad, not sure this is a good thing (got big shoes to fill). Overall John David did really well and learning that he did most of his stunts was an added bonus. My first like-able Nolan female character (she can act). The end of the movie was a bit sad ""but it's only the beginning of a beautiful friendship"". I am going with 9/10 only because I wanted more actions. The inverted action sequences were well done. Great attention to details!"
110," Innovative and Entertaining
","I'm not going to get into whether it all made sense.... More pertinent, perhaps; rather than feeling like I needed to see it a second time to understand it, I wanted to watch it again simply because I enjoyed it so much. Even if you see it only once, Christopher Nolan is a masterful storyteller and it is admirable that he is willing to try something outside of the typical Hollywood storytelling conventions. I loved Interstellar and Inception, and Memento is a masterpiece; Tenet did not disappoint. Great action sequences, excellent dialogue; in my mind, definitely one of the best movies I have seen this year."
111," This movie makes my head hurt and I love it
","This movie is incredible. It introduces items who can move back through time, as if they are in a rewinded movie. This happens simultaneous to the real time world and it is sometimes pretty hard to keep track of what and who moves how and why but most importantly when. Acting is amazing, John David Washington is a very good actor and I hope to see more of him (maybe too soon to think about this but I could really see him play the next Black Panther). Nolan created a true masterpiece again. The one flaw with this movie is that it sometimes moves a little too quick, causing you to wonder what is happening a lot of the time. There were a couple of scenes which I thought looked really cool but had me wondering ""wait, why are we here again?"" All in all amazing acting and terrific action scenes. Highly recommended."
112," Can't wait for a second viewing!
",Very much in the same vain as inception. I think just as good though I'd rather see it again before making that assertion.
113," Don't Evaluate Too Much After First Watch!
","This movie has so many layers, one couldn't possibly pick up on each one by the first watch. Too many impulses are triggered, to see beneath the surface.
On second watch, when your brain wont be only oquipied by trying to keep up with the complex storyline, you will discover the true meaning of it as well as the humanity and soul of the three main characters."
114," Palindrome
","I've read some reviews and I'm mystified that none analize the movie in connection with his title. TENET is a part of the most famous palindrome in the world, and there are plenty of hints in the movie that refers to it. Maybe knowing it, may help more people to understand the concept that was the basis of the whole movie: What goes around comes around!
SATOR
AREPO
TENET
OPERA
ROTAS"
115," Complexity at its Best!
","After reading the comments here , I'll lay this out for anyone that's still trying to decide to check this out. It's a complex but entertaining, visually amazing, It's something you'll want to watch again. If this is too much for you , I don't recommend it. I personally enjoy these movies . 'Annihilation' , 'Interstellar' , and many other movies will compare . Some people like predictably in their movies , if you do this is not for you . Not downgrading what people want or like for their entertainment, don't try and turn that into that . Clearly stating that if you like trying to figure out a storyline as your going through the movie , this is for you."
116," Sometimes a fantasy is all you need.
","Christopher Nolan has been hit or miss over the years. But when he is on, he's on. Tenet is on.
Ever since I first saw the trailers last year, I was interested. And with going to the movies becoming such a rarity in 2020, I was looking forward to a magical movie experience and crossing my fingers that Mr Nolan would deliver. And I am happy to say that Tenet did the trick for me.
It is not a perfect movie, but it provides a modern day movie experience unlike any other I have ever seen. It does follow the normal 3 act film structure, but that seems to be where it's conventional ties somewhat taper off. Tenet is unconventional to say the least. It is a visual spectacle, the screen popped with crisp originality. The acting was strong, although the dialogue seemed mostly to service the plot. As far as the story, I can understand how some can find it confounding, perhaps unnecessarily so; however that does not mean the story is lost within the plot. It is not. This is solid story telling with an original and modern delivery.
I recommend Tenet, but it is a provisional recommendation. I understand that not everyone goes to the theater for the same reasons. I do like a well-told story. Delivery is key. I found myself comparing Tenet to other mind-bending time twisters: Primer, The Matrix and Donnie Darko specifically. Comparisons aside though, you will have to decide for yourself if you are in the mood to spend money on a story that does not follow a straight line."
117," Worth a watch!
","This movie was definitely worth a trip to the cinema during certain times. Although we had to wear a mask, this movie did not disappoint. Me and my boyfriend splashed the cash and were rewarded with us being the only two in the whole screening!Many say it's similar to Inception, which I agree with to a degree, in that it makes you think. It is a movie in which if you take your eyes off the screen you will miss something, which will confuse you. However, the movie as a whole was very captivating, John Washington played an amazing role, as did Robert Pattinson, who I haven't seen in anything other than Twilight lol.All in all I would definitely say this movie is worth a watch and I will definitely be watching it again!"
118," Confusing but compelling
","Couldn't hear half the dialogue and only understood half of the rest, but it's a testament to Nolan's ambitious and undeniably exciting brand of filmmaking that I was on the edge of my seat throughout regardless: the espionage plot and sci-fi concept are both confusing but compelling, the action is brilliant, the technical aspects top notch. It's a shame the only emotion is found in yet another Russian villain and a simply modernized damsel-in-distress (Debicki's turn remains excellent though).
7.5/10"
119," Worth seeing it, at least once!
","Loved! It!
Yes It's complicated.. yes, you have to stay focused to understand it... but man oh man, does this movie deliver!
I want to see it again, and again and perhaps even again..
Great actors. Intense music. Breathtaking locations..
It made me want to stand up and applause.
Masterpiece!"
120," Too much entropy
","Compared to Nolan's ingenious Inception, Tenet is also ingenious but too entropic. That is: the positive and negative entropy throughout the cinematically stunning film makes it difficult - sometimes too difficult - to follow. And it becomes a bit tedious to watch the long forward/backwards time/entropy scenes. The philosophical questions and paradox of time/entropy travels remain, just like in the Terminator series, but with the added twist of ""inversion"" and matter/antimatter annihilation, which - again - is ingenious, but chaotic, and perhaps too ambitious? Not among Nolan's best movies, sorry."
121," Pretty good Nolan movie
","It's a Nolan film so you pretty much know what to expect. It's complex but really fun and looks great, (though the audio is a bit difficult to hear). I'd say 8/10."
122," Good movie
","Not a major Nolan fan, saying that this film was brilliant.I would say the best he's done yet, great cast and excellent story line."
123," Mind Blowing Story
","If you pay attention, you will experience bombshell after bombshell as certain things are revealed. It's a little hard to follow due to quiet and unclear dialogue, but it is a great movie with great writing, effects, acting, and action. I'll definitely be watching it again."
124," Intricate, complex and deep
","Tenet is an incredibly intricate film, exactly as one desires and expects coming from Christopher Nolan. The plot is fast-paced and continually builds upon itself until it reaches it's climax. This is definitely a film that demands your attention, and is probably not intended for those that just want to be entertained without being mentally engaged throughout the film. The script, score and filmography are exceptional. Nolan expertly explores the physical and philosophical aspects of time in the setting of an international espionage thriller. Highly recommend."
125," Testing my brain capacity to the max
",Excelent piece by Nolan. Lives up to the expectations. Second time even better
126," Is this a joke? A spoof? Its laughable.
","I waited all year for this movie. I talked it up to everybody. Oh well. I dont know where to begin about how bad this is... its just baaaaaddddd!!!! It looks good of course because of the budget but thats it. Atrocious casting, even worse acting, a script from a rejected SyFy movie, and a nonsensical plot based in fantasy without a shred of science. Its actually embarrassing to watch. I cringed and then laughed and then cringed and then laughed. If this is considered a good movie today then God help us all. I do say watch it though and judge for yourself. And then lie how great it was so you can be politically correct...or whatever. As for me I call a spade a spade and this movie sucks."
127," You really need to watch this again
","It would help if you watched this again... No joke. The first time you watch it, you will be so confused and dumbfounded. When you watch it also it will make more sense. It will be tough for an average viewer to gather all the movie's information at the first watch. But the more you watch it, and the more hidden elements will come to light. And when you can put these hidden elements together. You will realize how much of a masterpiece this film will be. John David Washington and Robert Pattinson are PHENOMENAL in this film. Their dynamic duo and they both give their A-game for this. Elizabeth Debicki, Kenneth Branagh, Aaron Taylor Johnson, and Fiona Douriff are also great and did a good job doing their parts. The cinematography is excellent. The music, however, I do agree, is too loud, and sometimes I can't understand what they are saying. For a second time with a friend, we both realize how good this film is, and the last act is the most fun you will ever get in this film. Is it the best Nolan film...... NO. But it is one of those films you'll appreciate a lot. 9/10."
128," Very Interesting Despite the Confusion
","Tenet is the newest movie from legendary director Christopher Nolan who delivers the intricacy of the story that he brings to all of his other films. The concept itself displays what Nolan does best which is swinging for the fences and it pays off once more. I can guarantee this is something you have never seen before. The plot is full of twists and turns which work because of the stellar acting from John David-Washington (the Protagonist), Robert Pattinson (Neil) and Kenneth Branagh (Andrei Sator) and the writing by Nolan himself. The mix between practical effects and CGI work perfectly together and they blend really well. The score is brilliant and exactly what you can expect from Oscar winner Ludwig Göransen, it is perfect for the story they're telling and I'm sure it will bring more awards his way. The film never lets up and the pace is rapid with the audience having to pay full attention at all times. The decision to not give the main character an actual name is perfect and explains what the organisation (Tenet) is to the viewer in a very subtle way.
Overall, I loved this film, for sure parts of it were confusing but it is still an incredibly entertaining ride which I highly recommend to anyone who loves to watch something they have never seen before."
129," Disappointing at first watch, Masterpiece at second
","Its one hell of a complicated film. It will be very hard for an average viewer to gather all the information provided by this movie at the first watch. But the more you watch it, more hidden elements will come to light. And when you are able to put these hidden elements together. You will realize that this movie is just a ""masterpiece"" which takes the legacy of Christopher Nolan ForwardIf I talk about acting, Then I have to say that Robert Pattinson has really proved himself as a very good actor in these recent years. And I am sure his acting skills will increase with time. His performance is charming and very smooth. Whenever he is on the camera, he steals the focus John David Washington is also fantastic in this movie. His performance is electrifying, I hope to see more from him in the future. Other characters such as Kenneth Branagh, Elizabeth, Himesh Patel, Dimple Kapadia, Clémence Poésy have also done quite well. And I dont think there is a need to talk about Michael CaineTalking about Music, its awesome. I dont think you will miss Hans Zimmer's score. Ludwig has done a sufficient job. There is no lack of good score in the movieGotta love the editing and post production which has been put into this movie. I think its fair to say this Nolan film has focused more in its post production."
130," Big Nolan fan but this is a no from me.
","Spoiler-freeThe editing is confusing in places. One minute we are in one area and the next, the same character is in another area. Now this isn't part of the inversion process but just a general cut from one place to another but it was done so jarringly it felt as though it was thrown together quickly to reach a deadline.The plot is all over the place with a lot of loopholes but I guess the whole thing can be explained by saying ""Paradox"" a few more times.The acting is nothing special. In fact in some places I really struggled to hear what was being said because of a sudden loud piece of music drowning out the actor's one line. Again, was it thrown together? A decent sound mixer / composer would have avoided this issue.The action is ""meh"". Yes there are some cool inverted scenes but not enough to warrant the long run-time and at the end with most people in full riot gear, I really struggled to tell who was who and, more to the point, to care about any of them.More annoying is the film follows this pattern:1. do something cool.
2. explain how
3. talk about doing something cool
4. explain how
5. explain again for the people at the back
6. do something cool
7. explain what happened just in case people still aren't following.
8. explain again.
9. talk about doing something cool...It's the same process from start to start and, quite frankly, it is boring and that is something I never thought I would say. Inception was mesmerising from start to finish but this is misfire after misfire.Christopher Nolan thinks he is a clever filmmaker but, in this instance, he has just tried too hard."
131," A unique masterpiece
","I'm used to watching complicated movies, being a Nolan fan. However, this one was really next level. Although I didn't understand everything, the complicated plot didn't bother me. I'm definitely going to re-watch the movie a couple of times. Apart from the plot, Nolan also managed to turn it into an impressive blockbuster with a spy-like theme. It is packed with action scenes, explosions, and beautiful stunt work. I've seen the movie in IMAX, which I recommend to everyone. Very impressive experience.I think this movie is certainly not for everyone. If you don't like complicated plots and want to sit back while watching an action movie, you might want to wait until the new Bond movie comes out in November..."
132," An Experimental Thriller Disguised As A Blockbuster
","I've seen a lot of hate for Tenet, but I honestly believe the movie will age very well, and a lot of the people who hate it now will come to realize just how ahead of its time it is. I will admit that it prioritizes concept over plot and character, and hard-to-hear dialogue has become a recurring problem for Nolan. But the movie is great, and I like it more the more I think about it. You don't need to be super smart to understand it, as some diehard Nolan fans claim, but I believe you do need to be fascinated enough by the philosophy of time to make it a pleasant experience. Without that, I think the movie will bore you and that boredom will probably lead you to miss some key points needed to fill in the puzzle. Filling in the puzzle doesn't mean you'll like it though, because this movie is an experimental thriller disguised as a blockbuster, which is not what people expected.Hey, maybe I'm wrong, but I expect the love for this movie will grow over the years."
133," From another world
","What can I say, recorded in a perfect way, and completely mind blowing.Even you fully focus you will need to watch it two or three times to get it."
134," Tenet
","A super fresh take on the spy theme, with immaculate ideas, outstanding visuals, great characters, and amazingly coordinated action sequences !"
135," Audio mixing is terrible
","Whoever mixed the audio for this movie is incompetent. First time in a long time I've had to constantly turn the sound up and down. The dialog is a level 5, the sound effects are a level 20."
136," Christopher Nolan has made another great movie (shocker!) (Non-spoiler review)
","So how best to describe this movie? Imagine Christopher Nolan directing James Bond but.....with time travel incorporated into the mix. Have seen plenty of reviews online claiming that this is a very complex film. One that is very hard to comprehend in its entirety in a single viewing. That couldn't be further from the truth and I don't know what has happened to our critics. This is one of Nolan's more simpler films. There is a ton of exposition dedicated to explaining the specifics of time inversion, the predestination theory of time travel etc. I won't go into the details as that would venture into spoiler territory but the movie basically spoon feeds the audience and to be honest, at times it was too on the nose for me. Critics will find movies like Endgame perfect which had multiple contradictions during the course of its own narrative. No wonder that Scorsese thinks we're killing cinema.Onto the action in this film. There was this misconception in the online film sphere that Nolan is 'bad' with action scenes. Folks who believed that will have to eat up their words as this film has some of the best action scenes that i've seen in some time. The visuals and the stunts are breathtaking and to think that Nolan achieved with no CG. I know Nolan doesn't like to give away BTS footage but I hope he makes an exception for this film. I'm dying to see how they achieved this in camera with no green screens. As with most Nolan movies, the score is once again a strong aspect which enhances the viewing experience. For the longest time, I thought Hans Zimmer was the composer and you'd be forgiven if you're still under that impression but apparently, Zimmer was busy with another film and Ludwig Goransson replaced him and he has done an excellent job.To close it off, I'd like to discuss some of the negatives. This movie has paper thin characters like they're almost non existent. I know bloggers are using this to fuel this narrative that this is Nolan's achilles' heel and that he's 'bad' with character work. These people are really bad with memory. This is the same director who reinvented Batman for a generation by making you care about Bruce and Batman simultaneously. Something that was unprecedented at the time. His character work has always been one of his core strengths. I cared about Dom Cobb in Inception and I cared about the Cooper family in Interstellar. These are beautifully fleshed out characters. Dunkirk was always going to be a plot heavy film but I really wanted more with the characters in this particular film. Nothing wrong with the performances though. All of them were awesome. Loved the chemistry between John David Washington and Robert Pattinson.The weak character work is the only thing holding me back from giving this film a perfect score. With stronger character work, this would've been an all time classic."
137," Complicated, but understandable movie innovation
","Do you even imagine how hard is it to create something absolutely new in 2020? But Nolan nailed it, having produced pure innovative beauty!"
138," Tenet *WARNING* Spoilers
","If you have had the luxury of going to the theaters or you are planning on watching Tenet this review will give you an idea of what to expect. I will not try to give any spoilers that are not in the trailer. To begin, the plot of Tenet is fairly complex. The Protagonist is apart of the CIA, he ""dies"" on a mission and is sent on a mission to save the world. The future and the past coincide and it's his job to find out what is happening and put an end to it. IF you thought Inception was difficult to follow you are in for a doozy. In fact, I would go so far as to say that unless you are able to easily follow what happened in Inception, please don't watch this as your head may explode. They are by no means comparable in terms of plot; however, as someone who just watched Tenet for a second time, there are still several information gaps I don't fully understand. That being said if you have great focus and love to investigate, you love brain games and confusion, I would thoroughly recommend this as it will take you into a wild ride. IF however, you are the average viewer looking to spend a day/an evening ""unplugging"" or enjoying sane writing do yourself a favor and avoid this one. I intend to watch this movie likely two more times, but not until it comes out on DVD/Online. Subtitles are very important here as, with all of Christopher Nolan's films, the writing is essential to understanding what is happening in the film and there are two relatively important characters that I was only able to understand 50% of what was said, because of their thick accent and involved wording. Again, this was my second viewing. All told, I would give this film an 8/10. In spite of being extremely difficult to follow and probably intentional holes that I would like to have seen filled, it is still an incredible idea executed well, but not something for everyone to enjoy."
139," TIME LOST
","I win the prize for spotting the only exchange of dialogue that isn't exposition in two and a half hours of ""You have to do this thing""
""Why ?"" ""Because it will make this other thing happen"" (cue the things happening -in CGI). I won't spoil the surprise but it's in the scene where Michael Caine gives his take-the-money-and-run cameo. Although there is nothing but plot, you should find it easy to identify the stock characters and allocate appropriate personalities. Beautiful, skinny seven foot tall woman who has accidentally married the world's most evil arms dealer ; World's most evil arms dealer (Branagh as Sergei Meerket) ; Dependable mockney soldier who has mysteriously risen to senior officer, despite an accent that drifts from Bow Bells to Beau Bridges. The CIA hero is without personality so he is brilliantly cast. Don't be put off by the cliches as they pile up or the plot points left hanging in the air like the bus in INCEPTION because apparently none of this has happened...except in the future. So can I have those two and a half hours back, please ?"
140," It's a Christopher Nolan Film
","As I left the theatre I joked that Tenet is basically if Interstellar and Inception had a baby and Memento was hired as the nanny. That illustration will either excite you or overwhelm you.If you like Christopher Nolan I'm sure you will like this one. If you're looking for something ""brand new"" out of him you probably won't find it here. His films have a specific style and this one is on brand. It works for me but it might not for everyone.I will say, I appreciate his longing to continue to use practical effects as well as wanting to think outside the box in what is possible for on screen storytelling. You never feel like he has mailed in a project and it comes across as the viewer, and that alone is a win."
141," One of Nolan's best yet
","NO SPOILERS QUICK REVIEW: Originally I would have scored this film a 7 out of 10 after my first watch, but upon rewatch I've began to love this film, finding it very fluent and intriguing as a blockbuster story. I must also compliment on the film's technical areas the score, effects, sound, cinematography etc. as they are very unique and masterful all around.Also I'd like to praise all of the cast on giving their full effort for Nolan once again especially John David Washington in the lead role. Personally I believe this film will age like fine wine and it will be treasured for years to come."
142," Masterpiece
","I must say I'm a big fan of Nolan and big fan of ""smart scifi"". This is why I had high excpectations going in to finally watch Tenet. And boy did it deliver! I just came out of the movie theatre feeling like my brain was just put in a blender. I will have to watch this movie a few more times to understand better what I just witnessed, and I will gladly do that!The best way to describe this movie shortly would be probably to just say that Tenet absolutely does not underestimate the viewer or try to explain things too much. This movie just happens, whether you are ready or not! This was probably the hardest movie that I have ever watched due to both complexity of the plot and fast pace of action. And probably one of the most rewarding also!This truly is a long-awaited masterpiece from Nolan!"
143," Enjoyed it even though it's a bit hard to hear, and follow
","It was long yet I enjoyed every moment. But truth be known, I found the concepts a little hard to piece together. I suspect that is because at times it was very difficult to hear. The opening scene is loud and most people are wearing gas masks. And from there On, there are many times where it's hard to hear the dialogue over the other sounds. Maybe it was the cinema mix. Anyway, still enjoyed it immensely. Great stunts and locations, 9/10 acting, like the sci-fi concepts. More adventure than sci-go though, just FYI. Worth the time and money."
144," Excellent, even if I didn't fully get it.
","This is the first film in a while where I'm going to watch it a second time, partly because I enjoyed it first time round, but primarily because I wanted to understand it better.It's a very, very good film, I enjoy complex, Tenet takes complex to a whole new level. Great if you have the ability to concentrate, frustrating I would imagine for a casual viewer, I heard several people moaning they hadn't a clue what they'd just watched.I found it rather exciting, and very entertaining, I'm not sure if it was the cinema I was in, but the sound wasn't exactly perfect, the music seemed to overpower the dialogue.Robert Pattinson, my heart sank when I heard he was going to play Batman, however, after watching this, I'm now convinced he'll do a great job, he was terrific in this.Don't be surprised if you want a second viewing for clarity, well worth it, excellent movie. 8/10."
145," This belongs under fantasy, not Sci-fi
","For me a science fiction movie has a science component in it. This felt more like fantasy, with the whole thing completely losing any sense of reality.
I just stopped watching after 1,5h when the car was driving backwards. Seriously, it just makes no sense. What a waste of time (some pun intended)."
146," Awful
","This movie was so pretentious, Chris Nolan has lost it - left half way through the music going backwards give me a sore head. Don't waste your time going to this."
147," I love it...after watching it twice
","After a long wait, it is worth it. It has great scenes with great music that makes it even more impressive. But I missed Hans Zimmer. Great performance of John David Washington, till today I didn't know him :D"
148," He did it again.
",Another masterpiece. I love it. Still thinking about what I watched. I need to watch again!
149," Finally a good movie
","Getting really sick of movies with representation just for the sake of representation. Thoroughly enjoyed this move. Nothing being pushed in your face. Every character brings serious depth regardless of their color. Great storyline, with enough mystery, action and awesome music. Will rewatch."
150," A masterpiece.
",The only reason I am giving 9/10 to this it's because it is too damn hard to make sense of it. I will need to rewatch it.
151," Good science-fiction movie
","Loved it. Action - Science-fiction movie.
Storyline is solid. The dialogue sound quality is a bit of an issue especially during very loud background action. Could be adjusted."
152," An extremely challenging film.
","Tenet is a very complicated film and I definitely felt that overwhelming confusion during my 1st viewing. However, after the 2nd time I was able to grasp so much more and truly appreciate what Nolan was going for.This is by no means a perfect movie and is not particularly one of my favorite movies by Nolan, atleast not yet...perhaps this film will only get better with repeat viewings.Some of the exposition given to audience is heavy-handed and can be alot to process. The nature in which many of the characters communicate does not come off as completely natural and can definitely throw you off. I cannot wait to watch this on blu-ray so I can put subtitles on to decipher all of the dialogue and grasp everything going on in each scene.Despite this minor flaw I had, the film picks up to a super fast pace during the second half of the film and had my eyes glued to the screen. Some of the stuff Nolan does with the camera is ingenious. Truly some of the coolest scenes I've experienced at the theatres.All technical film making aspects are top notch besides maybe some of the sound mixing as it can muffle some of the essential dialogue between characters.Overall, I had a really good time during my first view and a great time during my second. I don't think this is one of Nolan's masterpieces, but I do think it is a smart action spy thriller with cool twists and turns."
153," Inception no longer Nolan's dumbest movie.
","Although I did not pay a dime to see this nonsense, I still feel I should be paid for my time wasted on watching this garbage. My god, another poor idiots deep film by Chris Convolutions Nolan.I imagine people who like this vapid trash coming out of the theatre, having their puny minds blown and going ""Whoa!!!"" with a Keanu Reeves accent, not realizing they have not remembered a single plot point of this flaccid cash grab.First of all, the main protagonist is a massive Gary Stu and the actor is a wooden as they get with his dead-pan dialogue. Also the audio is really bad. Also Nolans casual use of random incoherent mystical symbolisms is obvious, childish and tiring, spray-painting meaningless references to the sator-square everywhere like a chump. It is loathsomely void and dumb.The whole plot gimmick falls apart as soon as you actually have a think about it. Entropy and time are NOT THE SAME THING!!!! It simply does not work. But it works SO badly that it is used in every way possible. It has no actual rules, so it just is a free-for-all McGuffin for Nolan to wind around and around the waver thin plot in a desperate attempt to obfuscate and convolute the script to the point where paying attention starts to hurt and, for most people, lazy complacency takes over and they just absorb the spectacle of it without thinking.Unfortunately one can not blame obvious frauds like Nolan for his success. After all, if the public was not so hungry for empty meaningless escapism without substance, guys like that would be doing some horrid office job, not raping culture with their feeble media chud.It is a bad and forgettable movie. It offers nothing of value or interest and in a perfect world, it would have never even been considered worth considering. Alas, it is obviously not a perfect world, but if you IQ is higher than your shoe size, don't bother with this dilapidated nonsense."
154," Wow! Intricate story and incredible editing
","Really enjoy Nolan's films and understood he likes non-linear storytelling. I gave 9/10 and not 10/10 because maybe a tad bit too far this time. However, lots of oh yeah moments, tremendous action, great acting and in the end, the writer ties it all together albeit with a few head scratches. Still great experience and loved being back in a theater."
155," Loud, choppy, obscure and not as great as you want it to be
","***** Potential SPOILERS *****Tenet follows the great Nolan tradition of really bad sound. It annoyingly loud and at times you can't hear what characters are saying. Nolan, fire your sound mixer. If you're mixing it yourself, fire yourself and get someone who knows what they're doing. Really s#!t work.It's also really badly edited (whether that's strictly editing or the script itself, who knows?). Some scenes happen with zero segue, and then at other points the movie gets bogged down. Unfortunately it's hard to care about the characters and story. Everything is a bit too rushed, and you don't have time to really soak it up and enjoy it.The time-bendiness is classic Nolan, but it's obscure and difficult to get a grasp on. Maybe the film will fare better with repeated viewings, but after a one-off watching it's potential tantalizingness is significantly diminished. Yes, there are some great things to ponder, but the core narrative of the story is buried so deep that it becomes a little ineffective. There is a reason for the time-bendiness, but it's obscured and to be honest I was a bit weary by the time it was all revealed.The basic plot of the film is okay, but I didn't really dig the ""inversion"" part. It's clunky and odd. Some great ideas and scenes, but overall it was difficult to follow clearly.Plus, the time-bendiness is never really explored in a way that lets you revel in it. Rather, it's hidden and revealed bit by bit which unfortunately means that you don't get to fully enjoy it.There's no theme here, at least in the way that other Nolan films have; Inception was about redemption, Interstellar was about the power of love or something, the Prestige was about revenge etc etc. This one doesn't really have that. Not a bad thing, though.The acting is okay, but Nolan never gives the audience time to settle in. The relationship between Washington and Debicki's characters seems to be important, but why? Who knows? Neither character is given time to answer that question sufficiently.This is really the main problem here. The pacing of the film is a bit all over the place, and it's hard to get involved with it. It jumps about from scene to scene at times with no explanation. I mean, I was able to follow it, but a few times I was asking ""What are they doing and why?"" and it took a while to understand (I'm not talking about the time-bendiness here either), which really diminished the film. In one scene, they're trying to get to a particular character. Why? You don't know till the scene is halfway finished. So instead you just sit there and watch them do some admittedly neat action scenes, but it's undermined because I have no idea what the goal is.Overall, it's okay. It spends too much time trying to hide it's big reveals for them to be effective, and it's too rushed/badly paced to get into. I hope that repeated viewings (on Netflix) will make it better."
156," Left after an hour
",I couldn't understand anything and had no idea what was going on after the first 60 minutes so I bounced
157," People are calling this a masterpiece!?
","Two stars because it was at least entertaining. A ""masterpiece"" though? How pretentious can you get? This is no masterpiece. The problem I had with it, was they had this really cool idea about time, and how people can move forward or backward through it for some nefarious purpose, then they muddied it up with a story they never explained, and kept going without ever connecting the dots. The grand moral at the end was ""a mother's love is stronger than anything, and she'll do whatever she has to to be with her son."" Like was that why this movie exists?!?!? This is a masterpiece?!? Grow up.I started getting pissed when the characters had to construct this elaborate plan to break into that high-security vault to steal the drawing. The heist was actually interesting and there was action present. Afterall that drawing (for no legitimate or logical reason) was forcing the girl to be a slave to her abusive husband. So protagonist and Neil construct this plan and go into the vault, dodging the suffocation gas that puts out fires, ultimately finding future protagonist and scuffle. And that's it.However long later, girl is on cloud nine cause protagonist stole the drawing. But he didn't really; he lied, for some reason?!? Girl finds out that he lied because abusive husband serves her the drawing on a silver breakfast platter. So here we are, an elaborate heist, a failed mission, a lie saying they succeeded, but no clear reason as to why any of that mattered or why protagonist would lie to her. And back to the drawing... how can a shiiiitteee piece of paper of two people hugging (or something) force girl to be a slave?!!!!?Again. This is no masterpiece. You're not interesting, enlightened, or an intellectual for using that word. You appear the opposite because ""having to use my brain"" does not make it a good movie. If anything, your brain swindled you by creating a fantasy or an explanation of this film that is incorrect. It was entirely incoherent, and while it had a cool premise, it failed completely. I might watch it again so I can at least remember character names when I go to talk badly about it. After 2.5 hours of watching four characters spin in circles around each other, the only memorable name was Neil. Goes to show how poorly these characters were written and developed. Totally unmemorable. Pass."
158," Nolan has nothing to say
","This is what happens when a director that basically has nothing to say on humanity try to do something complex/substantial. This is what happens when people make him a genius when the guy just basically directed comics adaptation. This is what happens when people put higher rating on a Batman#10 vs any other classic masterpiece. Nolan would better stick to shoot standard action movies. And when you basically direct your film based on market research, u better just keep it simple"
159," Watch At Your Own Peril
","""Tenet"" is neither complicated nor clever. It's an implausible action/espionage story with ridiculous time travel nonsense thrown in. It's sort of a very bad combination of the ""Mission Impossible"" films, the ""Terminator"" films, and ""12 Monkeys."" The characters are trite, and, in some cases, the actors are poorly cast for roles; I can't imagine any audience member actually caring about any of these cardboard cutouts. The script is often laughable in its attempt to be mysterious, exciting, and deep, none of which it achieves. Much of the dialogue, in trying to be impressive, is actually comical. While it has a lot of action scenes, they are often drawn out and tedious. And the idea of reversing the film to demonstrate reversing time is a cliché as old as film itself. The music is truly abominable, imitating old simple-minded analog electronic shtick from the 1970s or, mixing electronics and instrumental samples, pounding out a few crass themes over and over until you almost want to scream. And when I say pounding, I mean it, as the volume of the music and sound design are insufferably loud, sometimes drowning out the dialog.. Maybe the ear-shattering levels at which old rockers used to play as they went deaf influenced Nolan's preferences for final soundtrack mixes. Perhaps worst of all, the film is terribly bloated: an hour could have been cut from this film without giving up anything central to the paltry plot, and it still would have been too long. At 150 minutes, the film seems interminable. All of these problems lie at Nolan's feet, and he, alone, is responsible for this mess. While a lot of people seem to like this film, I know that many are impressed by quantity over quality, and allow themselves to be mesmerized by fast-paced action and cutting, all of which are derivative and lack any cinematic interest. It's the kitchen sink approach.In my opinion, Nolan has done four good films: ""Following,"" ""Momento,"" ""The Prestige,"" and ""Inception."" It seems that the more money he gets to make a film, the worse it is. I don't think I'll bother to see any of his work in the future. I do think whatever talent he had earlier in his career has dissipated in direct inverse proportion to the budgets of the films he writes and directs. Perhaps he could access reversed entropy to improve his future work."
160," A rewarding experience for the invested viewer
","This movie just starts and keeps going. Its constantly throwing things at you and it doesnt really care if you are following along or not.
I am a huge Christopher Nolan fan and for the first half I thought this was going to be a miss for me. I was following the story but i felt like something was missing. I trusted that if I stay invested that I would be rewarded by the end and man, that couldnt be more right. Around the halfway mark, Nolan starts to slowly show his hand at how the rest of the movie is gonna go and I WAS SO IN. He adds exactly what I thought was missing in the first half and made it all worth it. And by the time it comes to the end youll be begging to watch it again.
It rewards a curious and invested viewer and most certainly warrants multiple viewings. Im very happy with this movie and I highly recommend it."
161," I mean...it's Nolan.
",It's wonderful. It moves really fast and lots of talking but I understood exactly what was happening. The concept is ridiculous. Ridiculously spectacular. I love it. I'm going to see it again next week.
162," Great movie
","An excellent movie, difficult to wrap your head around the concept after watching once, but executed well. It's fast and action packed and everything starts to come together towards the end. Great cinematography and effects. There was a few parts where I thought that the concept was inconsistent but a great movie overall."
163," Nolan is the undisputed king of high-concept blockbusters
","What a film to welcome audiences back to cinemas. If you thought Inception or Interstellar were headscratchers, what til you get a load of Tenet. This is probably the most complex film I've ever seen. Christopher Nolan has recently become fixated on the concept of time and he takes his passion to mind-bending new heights in this film.The plot is, let's say, complicated. There's a whole lot going on that takes time to grasp. It will definitely take another watch to fully untangle, even with picking up on some of Nolan's classic subtleties.Simply put, the visuals are jaw-dropping. The way he films the time inversion in action scenes is stunning. I found myself amazed at how he managed to choreograph so many of these sequences. We're without legendary Hans Zimmer for this Nolan film, but Ludwig Goransson takes the reins and exceeds every expectation. His pulse-pounding, breathless score was terrific and fit the film perfectly.I have to mention my biggest issue with the film: the sound mixing. A sizable chunk of the dialogue is inaudible due to the blaring score and background noises. This really hampered understanding and the overall experience. Nolan seems to be getting progressively worse about this ever since Bane in The Dark Knight Rises.I found Tenet to be extremely entertaining and stimulating. I appreciate that there is a director in Hollywood who loves creating challenging, yet rewarding movies for filmgoers. Tenet is a fascinating puzzle to unravel and I'm excited to put more pieces together on future watches."
164," Sci-Fi Bending Brilliance
","Christopher Nolan has done it again. Like Denis Villeneuve and Kubrick, when Christopher Nolan makes a new movie attention needs to be paid. Not since Inception has a film been so brilliantly written. Ignore the negative reviews stating the film is awful. These morons clearly need to stick with crap from Marvel and Disney as they clearly have no intelligence or brain capacity. These morons probably thought Parasite was good! If however you want a film that gets better with every viewing due to its puzzle box script like Donnie Darko or Mulholland Drive then this is one of best films you will see all year.Only Dune will get anywhere near this, this year!"
165," The most CONFUSING Nolan Film
","The film is really entertaining. But it's really confusing. The 1st hour is okay and then the second hour screws your brain hard with the final act making sense again. The action,cinematography and score were excellent. Definitely need to watch it twice"
166," Exhilarating
","I enjoyed this movie from start to finish. The few problems I had with the movie had nothing to do with the story. Sometimes the sound mixing was rough. SFX and music overtook some dialogue, a few cliche lines which I will boil down to rushing. The main villain needed to be fleshed out a bit more. I watched this movie twice so far and have gleaned so much from the second watch. One of my favorite movies from the past two years."
167," Confusing at first. Rewarding when thinking about it.
",Confused while watching it but with time to think about it afterwards it makes sense
168," loved this film
","Even thou it was confusing at times, I loved it and I highly recommend it."
169," Irreversibly Palindromic...
",After exercising cerebrum capacity to its maximum extent I'm unsure if this was worth the effort - not the unravelling of the puzzle but what they were trying to save.
170," Tenet
",This will be hard to be spoiler free so here we go I won't go into the plot but just know that it's very tightly done and like most of Nolan's movies it's plot over characters so nothing supper interesting going on with the characters but the plot keeps it fresh and interesting the acting was good all around and visually is incredible this was my first Christopher Nolan movie in IMAX and it was insane the only problem is the sound mixing was a bit bad I had problems hearing dialogue I thought it was just my theatre but other people were saying the same thing and saying that's what it was like at other Nolan movies but I don't know. I feel this is a movie to watch a couple of times and all the science stuff was it as boring as it was in interstellar(still a good movie) I don't think this is his best movie but it's still really good and has a really interesting concept behind it I would it look into anything about this movie before you see it because that'll give you a better viewing experience if you are reading this and having seen the movie stop what you're doing and go now I strongly recommend this film to people and don't hurt you're head thinking about the movie
171," Second Watch makes it a 10
","Saw this first on Wednesday and then again today Friday. Left on Wednesday thinking 'Yeah that was great, but so much happened I really need to watch it again'. Left today thinking 'Superb, can I watch it over again as it's that good'.The final sequence with the red and blue squads is superb but only really understood it second time around.As someone else has said I struggled with the sound most of the way through the first viewing. Muffled voices through masks is not helpful but today I got most of it. The sound effects and pace of the film is relentless and doesn't give you a minute to catch your breath.Overall I would say it's fantastic. Just go and the cinema was super safe both times we went."
172," Please Stop Blindly Liking Everything Nolan Does
","I love MOST Christopher Nolan movies, but Tenet was bad. Really bad. It made about as much sense as a Joe Biden speech. The action sequences were just ok. The music was 112 decibels louder than the speech, which was muffled 75% of the time by a mask. The dialogue was like trying to understand the crazy brother portrayed by Tom Hardy in Legend, while the crazy brother was wearing scuba gear.It was not thought provoking like Inception, as the only thought I had was ""When will this be over?"" And ""Why isn't that weird vampire guy sparkling in this movie?"".Please, please, please don't turn Christopher Nolan into another Quentin Tarantino, where you give his movies 10 stars regardless of how bad it is. Your blind, sheeplike reviews just cost me $90 at the theater."
173," Christopher Nolan has done it again
","Critics may not like it, just like they didn't like Interstellar. But Tenet really is incredible, and I'm sure the audience will agree with me when they see it. Enjoy!"
174," Fantastic experience
","Tenet ist fantastic and gave me what only few movies did before - a whole new experience.Christopher Nolan delivered something that has never been seen before and made me walk out of the cinema backwards so I can walk in one more time to watch it again.It is a mindtwisting film and it made me talk about it for more than an hour after I watched it for the first time.And yes, it is not perfect as nothing in life is, yet it is a cinematic experience I won't forget and it is an entry in my list of movies you have to see at least once."
175," Good movie but too complicated for a casual viewing
",I'd suggest people read the synopsis on Wikipedia before watching the time. Otherwise it would be too hard to follow. If you're the type of person who enjoys watching a movie multiple times and dissecting it then you'll enjoy Tenet
176," Why play dramatic music over every scene?
",This was a confusing plotless film which relies on ambiguity to make the viewer think they are watching something unique and special. The dramatic music over every scene is ridiculous and unnecessary. Reversing the film footage isn't artistic. Just watch Déjà Vu if you want a impressive time travel film.
177," Millions of $ to make a ""Sci-fi"" movie in the cheapest way possible
","And the loudest music you could hear in a movie. If you want to know the level of intelligence of the movie here are 2 ""non-spoiler"" lines:
-if ... happens the whole world will be destroyed.
Including my son?There you go ... Expand that to the whole movie and add some awful acting."
178," worse than Inception
",What a barely coherent mess. Plot is so weak and all characters one dimensional. The director just wanted to showcase us how technically cool he is with mixed timelines. Bravo!
179," Another Nolan Masterpiece
","Tenet is a work of genius. Christopher Nolan delivers again with another heady action blockbuster. Like some of Nolan's previous efforts, Tenet is original and not a sequel, prequel, remake, or book adaptation. The film's story can be described as James Bond meets Inception, or James Bond on acid. With new talent at his disposal like John David Washington, Robert Pattinson, Elizabeth Debicki, and musical composer Ludwig Göransson, Nolan proves yet again his mastery of cinema.Nolan continues to create original concepts for each of his films. In Memento, the story unfolded in reverse. In Inception, he had multiple dream layers all moving more slowly in time the deeper the layer. In Interstellar, time was relative to space travel. In Dunkirk, time was disordered and then later reordered at a single climactic moment. In Tenet, characters and objects become inverted and travel backwards in time against objects moving forward. Only Christopher Nolan could come up with concepts so revolutionary and brain busting, only to make all of them work. It is even more astonishing that he makes these remarkable films only two or three years apart from each other. Tenet has Christopher Nolan written all over it. It features a lot of his trademarks like practical effects, gorgeous visuals, a talented ensemble, savvy banter, heady sci-fi themes, heart-pounding action, and an obsession with time. The characters were cool with the standout being Robert Pattinson. Pattinson was witty, stylish, and sophisticated in typical British fashion (he has come a long way since playing a gay vampire). The soundtrack from Ludwig Göransson -- doing his best to mimic Hans Zimmer who's absent due to commitments to Dune -- was epic and exciting. The sound design was loud yet immersive. The pacing was electric with an exciting set piece around every corner. The inversion concept humbles your own intellect. It leaves you in awe that Nolan could concoct such brilliance and make it work cinematically. The action, visuals, and music is a sensation for the eyes and ears, but the inversion is an all new experience for the mind.Tenet also features some of Nolan's worst trademarks like inaudible dialogue, extremely complex narrative structure, and emotional coldness. All of Nolan's films since The Dark Knight Rises muffle dialogue, the worst being in Tenet. Perhaps Nolan does this on purpose to intellectually mess with the audience, and hinder their ability to solve this cinematic Rubik's cube. Or maybe he wants to emphasize the visuals and the music instead of the dialogue. Either way subtitles are a must. To say Tenet is difficult to fully comprehend is a massive understatement. Events unfolding in reverse while action unfolds in real time is a brain buster in itself. Tenet wastes no time and spends much of the infrequent downtime explaining the plot or the physics of inversion. Many of Nolan's previous efforts are difficult to fully grasp after first viewing, which only increases the likelihood of watching the film again. Nolan's films are highly rewatchable thanks to this complexity, and of course the spectacle. In defense of this film being too difficult to follow, the scientist girl from the beginning said it best, ""Don't try to understand it, just feel it."" The spectacle and the theatricality feel incredible, yet is there an emotional core? There is attempted emotion, but most people do not go to see Tenet for the character relationships, and emotional catharsis. In defense of the film feeling emotionally empty, most films probably feel this way to people. All of Stanley Kubrick's films are emotionally cold. Nolan likes to stir our imaginations, our brains, and our adrenaline glands, not so much our hearts.Christopher Nolan is one of the greatest filmmakers of all time because with each film he makes he manages to thrill his audience with surface level action and drama, as well as layer each of his films with meaning and depth. There is always something new to pick up on after each viewing. Nolan combines the best elements of art house and commercial films to create the best kinds of films. Essentially, he combines the depth and intelligence of 2001: A Space Odyssey with the entertainment value of Star Wars. Tenet is another welcomed addition to this breed of artistic entertainment."
180," If Only I Had Ten More Brain Cells...
","A lot of the audience members of Tenet have complained that Tenet is too confusing to enjoy, and that's what unfortunately makes Tenet so unenjoyable at times for me. I already knew that Tenet was supposed to be confusing when going into the movie, so I tried my best to focus and listen, and yet I still got confused. There's a lot of different timelines going on with mashing sub plots, and the film didn't do a great job at explaining everything. Maybe it's just me, but the film was just really hard to follow. I even watched an explanation video, and that was even confusing. The plot is just really complex, and even though I couldn't really follow it the whole time, I still appreciated it because of how smart and deep it is.Aside from the plot, everything is near perfect. The inverted fight scenes were crazy in the best ways possible. There were times where I was just blown away by some of the scenes, and I questioned how Christopher Nolan filmed it Tenet is the first of its kind, and the fact that Christopher Nolan nailed it, I think he deserves some awards for that.Tenet is a really solid movie. With good performances from the actors, great action scenes, amazing direction, and an extremely complex and mind-blowing plot. Tenet deserves nothing less than a 7/10. And if you're going into this film for the first time, then prepare to awake the sixth sense, because this film will destroy every last brain cell."

",We'll be talking about this movie for years. Excited to see it again. Washington was unbelievable!
183," Awesome
","Not best of nolan but still awesome
It is very confusing and surprising at the same time"
184," One of the best movie ever!!!..no kidding
","This is the best experience you can get on theatre...This is a mind bending, innovatif and the action is like you never seen in movie before..Dont listen to stupid critics...you know what you expect from nolan movie...this movie is like memento meet inception meet interstellar and meet dark knight...it has complex plot and has so many detail you have to focus10/10"
185," Visually the most amazing movie since The Matrix (1999)
","While I think it's not Nolan best, I think it is definetly a really good movie, which you'll have to watch at least 2 times for understand, but it's worth it."
186," Very dangerous!
","Why? Volume!
In the last 5-10 years I feel cinema volume has been too low.
This was unacceptably high and Nolan should be fined for creating this health risk. Yes, he decided how loud it should play at your cinema.
I am not ready to review this movie for it's content. It's been TWO MONTHS since i saw it and it is still ringing DAILY in my ears.
So, since I'll probably never experience a quiet moment again for the rest of my life; Christopher Nolan: F.U."
187," Absolutely awful
","First let me start i was super excited to see this Christopher Nolan film as a fan of his previous complex story lines and a good initial rating.This film is dreadful no character build up at all, leaves you thinking what is going on all of the way through, poor acting and the list could go on. I wanted to walk out thoughtout this film it was that bad.Very, very disappointed think Nolan took his unique story telling in this to far and ruined it in doing so."
188," Nearly walked out
","An awful, confusing movie that at half way through, willed me to walk out. I couldn't care less what happened next, I was just bored with the complexity of the script and poor explanation of what the hell is going on."
189," Ultimately terrible
","This is like someone (Nolan) was joking and decided to spend 205.000.000$ on the crappiest scenario ever.
There is honestly nothing worth seeing in this movie. The picture is nice, but far from impressive. The story lacks convincing in every possible aspect and is utterly ridiculous. The originality? If you call stupidity original, then perhaps yes.
Let's see some stuff (if I still remember, since it's been more than a couple of weeks since I've watched this horrible, horrible movie):
1. The scientist invented a weapon that can wipe out the world, and then regretted it, so instead of destroying it, she divides it into several parts (artifacts) that she hides in the past, scattered around the world, and apparently together with the description and instructions describing what it is and how to reassemble the device. Seriously?! That's the best she could do?!?!
2. When people travel through time they need their own oxygen, but only in several scenes do they have the pipes and oxygen bag, while in most others they don't.
3. Things a time-traveler is using move backwards when in the past, but the person moves normally.
4. The highlight is the saying - not knowing is your greatest advantage?!?! Well, it did strike me on more than one occasion the script was written by a complete idiot.
5. One man is collecting the artifacts in order to destroy the world because he has cancer and wants the whole world (including his son) gone with him.
6. The protagonist is supposed to reach a powerful and well-guarded man who lives in a penthouse at the top of the building and whom no commoner saw in a long, long time. Two men get in and out of the place easily and without any problem. Just like that. Later on, the wife of that man (who is actually the one pulling strings) is freely walking among the city market, with less than a minimal number of security guides around her.
7. They can travel in time, but could not organize the final action better, without a terrible and pointless action where so many people died.
8. Eventually they retrieve all the artifacts, then again, instead of destroying them, they decide to hide them somewhere. C'mon!?!?! Why didn't they just killed the antagonist in the first place and left the originally hidden artifacts stay hidden where they were, if the whole point was simply to hide them again?!
There are probably far more ridiculously stupid moments, inconsistencies and gaps, throughout this 2.5 hours long agony of a movie.
There are so many good books in the world, and surely good scenarios - why is so much money spent on something so ultimately bad as is Tenet?!"
190," Absolutely Brilliant
",Nolan has done it again. This filmmaker is a genius. A must watch for all his fans.
191," MISSIT. BINIT. CHUCKIT.
","This movie is dross! Rubbish! Detritus! Crap!Nolan has become so arrogant that he really doesn't care if we enjoy his movies or not. I am sad that I paid for a ticket to reward him. I am hoping my review may stop you from doing the same.He has stated that he doesn't care that we can't hear the dialogue. It is his artistic choice.Well, thank you, thank you, Chris!The dialogue that I could hear was so bad that I delighted in not having to hear anymore. It certainly did not elaborate on the non-existent plot or add to the non-existent character development.As for the action scenes... Well done Chris on saving tons of money by using the same footage twice, once shown forward and once backward. Great bang for your buck. Not so much for the audience buck.Seriously, people have felt they need to see this claptrap in order to show superiority by actually understanding and enjoying it. There is nothing to understand other than realise that Nolan is so far up his own anus that he can't actually see what he's directing. As for enjoying, I was fortunate that the theatre was largely empty so I was able to type this review during the movie and thus, at least, reduce the pain of watching it.Give this monstrosity a miss at all costs!!🙄"
192," Masterful movie
","Watching this movie was the best movie/cinema experience I have ever had and you should definitely go and experience it too.It had great acting, story, cinematography, music and dialogue. The concept of inversion was worked out perfectly, just like you're used to from Nolan. Sure, it was complicated but if you pay attention it is really never incomprehensible. Because of the concept of inversion you'll set your eyes on things you have never seen before in any movie or series. That is also one of the many aspects that make Tenet a very special movie and a real experience, and an experience you will definitely want to experience again.
In my opinion, if you loved other Nolan movies like Inception, Interstellar, Memento and The Prestige you will undoubtedly absolutely love Tenet too.(I read that some people here had difficulties in hearing the dialogue. I am from The Netherlands so I watched it with subtitles, if you're also watching it with subtitles not hearing the dialogue will certainly not be a problem.)"
193," A big letdown from Christopher Nolan! Full of boring conversation, and frustrated action scene! Should have done better!
","This film start with a siege at the National Opera House, and the main character ""Protagonist"" been tortured scene! As turnout, this film is about two spies(Protagonist, and Neil) need to work together to take down a villain ""Sator"" by retrieve the Algorithm! Entire film full of boring conversation, and annoying overuse scene! Such as, overuse of the annoying sound effect scene, overuse of the backwards action scene, overuse of the same fighting scene, overuse of the flashbacks scene, overuse of the main character asking question scene, and overuse of the mask-up scene! Make the film painful to watch! Only intensity in the film is the explosion scene! At the end, Kat shot at Sator! Sator push by Kat into the water! The Protagonist kill Priya, while watching Kat with her son! That's it! Another disappointed film!"
194," Tenet is a worthy successor to Christopher Nolans obsessive Cinematic Journey about Time
","While I am always trying to be objective when watching a movie, I find myself captivated by Nolan's Movies as soon as the first scene starts. Here is a director that does not compromise his ideas and expresses love for the cinematic experience with every frame.Tenet gives you no time for consideration in the first half, by taking all your attention to the mysterious premise of an unknown foe. In this time even the dullest scenes of remote meetings get interesting and are carried by John David Washington. Compared to Inception (2010), where every part of the strategy was explained to the audience, here there is ample room for interpretation and the tempo is building up to a point where there is no time to try.In the second half, my personal revelation was the transformation of Elizabeth Debicki's Character from a Woman in Distress in need of saving to a determined uncompromising heroine. This highlighted a change in the movie as a whole and increased my respect for Debicki's acting.Even though I was not surprised by every twist towards the end, I was entertained and in awe of the overall experience. I didn't feel overwhelmed by the theories that were introduced and was pleasantly surprised of the execution.I would recommend this movie to everyone who is willing to experience it first, before trying to understand it."
195," Nolan does it again
","The only bad thing about this movie? That it had to be released in one of the worst years of our lives. This movie is so beautifully written and produced, and the execution of it all is really mind blowing. One of my favorite things about Nolan? He doesn't use CGI unless he absolutely has to. He loves the big set pieces and he is a genius at pulling them off. My next favorite thing about Nolan? He doesn't dumb down the script to satisfy a majority of people. He makes his art the way he wants to. I read this quote recently and I can't remember where but it basically said "" if you want dumb action, with no consequences or even a plot, go watch a Michael bay movie"". Perfect way to respond to some of the comments on here. It's simple, if you didn't get it, watch it again, maybe a few more times until you can appreciate it. If you still can't, stick to the simple movies. But don't get on here and bash this incredible movie. Nolan is a genius. The cast and crew did something remarkable here, and I wish it could have been appreciated by bigger audiences. Thanks China.To sum up, see this movie several times and you should absolutely love it, and more importantly, appreciate the work put into it."
196," Not as clever as it thinks it is.
","The plot, while confusing is actually straight forward, 2nd watch that is. Therein lies the problem.. I shouldn't, or anyone really, have to watch a 2 hour and 30 minute film twice to get the full picture. Nolan is very talented and very intelligent, especially his knowledge of the sciences. But, this film shows his ambition has lead him down an unnecessary road, confusion filmmaking.He's better suited to turning the implausible into reality and immersing the viewer fully in his vision. His attempt at redefining time travel movies has failed to actually interest anyone that was remotely interested in it. The biggest mistake is the lack of explanation of how this theory is possible (not just its origins). This leads to the film just honestly feeling silly to watch and not very interesting.As other viewers and critics alike have mentioned the sound, I feel I should address this. The score isn't awful, but it's not great and it's extraordinarily loud and dramatic when it shouldn't be. Maybe we've been spoiled by other Nolan films that have been graced by Hans Zimmer, this one is too loud. This destroys dialogue at times and I seriously struggled, especially with Robert Pattinson, to hear what the actors were mumbling. Taking into consideration that Nolan films rely heavily on his written word, they may want to address this. However, considering I watched this via Blu-Ray.. they clearly didn't.The acting was good, except for Washington. I feel his performance started strong and just levelled out into a down right average B-rate affair. As I said, acting was good.. just don't expect Oscar worthy performances from the rest. Aaron Taylor-Johnson, despite a short part, was the standout for me.It's visually stunning, but as I've said.. Nolan was far too ambitious and it really hasn't paid off for him. I don't wish to spend 5 hours watching a film just to understand it. But, once you do understand it you realise just how simple the premise is, but it's been overly complicated by an otherwise direct, intelligent & talented director, Christopher Nolan.He really needs to stop relying on the dramatic scores.. it didn't save him this time and it won't save him anymore. He is a genius and a genius filmmaker, but I don't want a genius script that confuses the life out of me, I want a great script that engages me.It's in no way a bad film, but, it isn't great either."
197," It seems that this 2020 is full of poor movies...
","To be honest I cannot comprehend why people are ""pumping up"" those scores... The movie is seriously boring and dull. I usually enjoy SF movies but this... Movie had literally no point. I watched approx 45 mins and I gave up. Poor script, forced action and absolutely no point. Poor actors (except one prominent name such as Michael Caine) and that is it...Waste of my time and money..."
198," I wanted to like it so bad!!
","Its not that i didnt understand the concept or direction and cinematography are bad. The ACTING is horrible and so is the sound mix and so is the hollow story.
Casted African American to avoid controversy, a british because he feels like giving them a chance and an Indian because of his fanbase.
HORRIBLE CASTING and ACTING.
I was so excited for this movie..Damn, he dropped the ball AGAIN after dunkirk."
199," Ahead of it's time...
","Another masterclass by Nolan. The genius to write such a movie with so much intermingled and intertwined if baffling.
This movie has been made to watch more than once to fully understand and appreciate it. Quite bold by Nolan but keeping true to his obvious fetish for time ( interstellar, memento, inception)
There are reviews giving out about music too loud or mumbled lines but these don't even come into such a gigantic and monumental achievement. Yes it will be great to watch it with subtitles but there's parts of the movie they have to wear a mask so obviously it'll be harder to hear (as we all know in current times). The score is spine tingling and thrilling - the louder the better I say.
Some people will be put off by the mental torture of trying to deal with time moving in 2 directions but just sit back and have faith that Nolan has you covered and it'll all make sense upon further viewings.
This movie is ahead of its time and will not be fully appreciated until it gets time to be viewed and reviewed and fully absorbed and pondered.
I for one look forward to watching it again and again for years to come just like Nolan's other greats.
You have to appreciate the fact that he uses minimal cgi when watching the edge of your seat action sequences.I just hope he's got more left in the tank to do it againSuperb!!!"
200," I didn't care about ANY of the characters
","Not really sure what to say about this movie. I just didn't care about any of the characters.Can't stand the type of movie where everything just lines up for the protagonist, and this is definitely one of those movies.Save your money."
201," Loved this one!
",A different twist to a movie! Things moving backwards made it a fun movie
202," Pretentious in an untimely manner...?
","*** POSSIBLE MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD ***Ok, I don't review many titles, but I feel the need to address this self-agrandizing Nolan 'epic' for what it is. And that is, a quasi-scientific bunch of hooey about a topic that clearly neither Nolan nor his target audience know much about. Having studied time, causality, quantum mechanics, GR/SR & a number of other time-related branches of physics, I have to say, I was quite under-whelmed by this one-trick pony. So much that I found it almost as annoying as Memento, or Matrix 2 & 3, a couple other one-trickers. Before you jump to conclusions, yes, I got it, I understood what it was all about, while piecing together the barely-heard conversations & expositions at several points in the film - turn down the effing music Nolan - I can listen to classical music any time I want without having to strain to hear someone bloody well speaking about major plot points!The main issue I have with Tenet is that it's all sci-fi nonsense & barely good sci-fi at that, mostly fantasy actually. Real physics aside, it just wasn't entertaining once you get the 'trick'. It just tried too hard to pander to neo-intelletuals with quasi-science causality mini-loops splattered throughout. Not to mention the motivations of the main bad guy are non-sensical, except for a completely insane psycopath who somehow manages to keep everyone loyal around him in the dark...because if they even had an inkling of what he wanted to achieve, why in God's name would anyone NOT completely insane ever help the maniac??? It's patently absurd & ridiculous with a number of glaring inconsistencies & plot holes that most will just gloss over. Even as pure entertainment I felt that my intelligence was being insulted, and I'm certainly no genius-level intellect! I can only imagine how all the poor career physicists must feel out there, to see their life's work assaulted by Hollywood like this yet again...In the end, it's about as satifying as invert sugar (pun intended). Watch at your own risk if you have 2.5 hrs to kill you definitely won't want back on your death bed. For the rest of you with some sense, I recommend you watch Primer instead if you want a more 'realistic' foray into time & causality loops, without the big budget, car chases & CGI explosions. You have been warned. 6/10 (mostly for Caine, Pattinson & the scenery)"
203," Meh

I get it was time travel and the overall general plot, but why did they have to make everything so vague. This is not a movie, this is a puzzle AND YOU BEST BET THAT NOBODY HAS TIME FOR THAT!!

But the actually problem with Debicki and Kenneth, why a genius craftsman like Nolan would hire stellar performers like debicki, Kenneth for creating unlike chemistry like our Indian commercials do ( Boyapati films Jaggu bhai and Rakul or Vivek-Sneha ) !There's no doubt Nolan Maama Garu delivered a solid classic with flattered strategies Puzzles but it's lack of logics Unlikely what his other film's did. The Idea was brilliant but not the outline as Savior of world from evil. This time he choosen ""Time"" as A ""Manipulative"" Evil. may be the most challenging of Nolan's films to date when it comes to wrapping one's mind around the concepts forming the narrative's foundation: backwards-moving entropy, non-linear thinking, temporal paradoxes.With TENET NOLAN MARKED HIS DEBUE IN BOND FILMS !"
214," A masterful trick on the mind.
","Ambitious, thrilling and visually stunning; ""Tenet"" is unlike anything you've ever seen or experienced on the big screen. A continuously entertaining and mind-boggling epic.In this action thriller, fighting for the survival of the entire world, a man journeys through a twilight world of international espionage on a mission that will unfold in something beyond real time.I'm warning you now; before seeing ""Tenet"" check your brain at the door and let the movie work it's magic. You will be lost earlier than know it while trying to figure out what the hell is going on here, but that's the beauty of ""Tenet"". Don't try to figure out the plot during the movie, do that afterwards. ""Tenet"" is a mind game and no one could do it better than Chris Nolan. This film is beautifully shot, terrifically acted and the action is full throttle. John David Washington continues to impress in this complex role and Robert Pattinson delivers sharpness and humour in his terrific performance. Elizabeth Debicki is great and the iconic Kenneth Branagh plays a damn good villain who's obsessed with his Fitbit (keep an eye on that detail). Ludwig Goransson's score is trendy and powerful, a perfect match for this film. You'll most probably never get the answers you're looking for while watching this film but there's no doubt that Nolan is a master of his craft. I'm looking forward to seeing ""Tenet"" again and probably again after that, just to see things I missed the first time around (yes, it's one of those movies). That being said, upon my first viewing I can't help but think that ""Tenet"" is a monumental cinematic achievement that will continuously test your mind and simultaneously have you pinned to the edge of your seat... and not many films can achieve all of that today.Follow @snobmedia for all reviews!"
215," Coolest sci fi since judgement day
",This movie is everything i love about sci fi. Thats all i need to say.
216," Intense, thought-provoking, time-bending thriller
","I never understand Nolan's movies the first time. They're both more complex and simpler than I initially anticipate. As in, there are too many details to fully take in with one viewing but, at the same time, many events and themes overlap with each-other. The answers were already there but I know I'll have to see it a few times to really get it. In the meantime, this movie is stuck in my head like nothing I've ever seen before.Many of the classic Nolan tropes are here - weird time stuff, people in fancy suits explaining rules and one-upping each-other alternately with threats and quips, epic action scenes with shooting, explosions, cars and planes, jittery pounding music, people looking at watches, seeing events from multiple angles, saving the world coming down to personal relationships, etc. There are also interesting themes of lifting yourself up by the bootstraps and transcending or breaking the rules to kind of have your cake and eat it too. Characters do the impossible and we're not sure if they were on top of things the whole time or barely fluked it.Nolan's movies are sometimes criticised for being too pretentious or laborious with exposition, but they're just very intricate and intelligent. Do people want him to explain everything thoroughly or let you work it out for yourself? It's a fine line between accessibility and mystery, not to mention how bold and original he's trying to be. When brand new concepts are being explored, I think a little confusion on the first watch is perfectly reasonable. It's not like Einstein's theory of relativity was immediately accepted as obvious.The music is suitably intense but it was very loud. I think the balance may have been off at my cinema - I couldn't always understand the dialogue which was already tricky to follow. The plot was very tricky to follow although it keeps you involved and excited about where everything's leading. In particular, it's very vague in terms of who the bad guys are or what's actually at stake and why. But the plot thickens and starts to come together quite literally.There were some touches which I enjoyed like the red logos at the start and a blue one at the end and a scene with trains going in opposite directions from each-other forming a nice visual metaphor (those will make more sense once you see the movie).The actors were all really good. Branagh plays a convincing and very nasty Russian or Ukrainian criminal, Pattinson's an intelligent buddy with mysterious intentions while Washington's a likeable and funny protagonist for us to relate to, seemingly as confused as us for most of the film.The main thing that stands out for me is the concept of this movie itself which has never been done before. It's simple and implied in the posters and trailers but I couldn't predict how Nolan would actually make it work. Even if the broader story still has loose ends for me, I can't stop thinking about it. They apparently consulted Kip Thorne or other scientists (I saw his name in the credits) and the physics seem to hold up pretty well under the circumstances. The implications are fascinating and hard to get your head around.Some of the action scenes echo Inception's hallway fight scenes but with a different twist to them. Instead of playing with gravity, Nolan's playing with time. Again, it makes you marvel at what you're watching and how on Earth they filmed it. A lot of clever planning, choreographing, editing and multiple takes I guess. After Tenet, other movies seem so plain and light, what with their exclusively forward motion of time and entropy. Few movies can match the sheer intensity and intricacy of Tenet which I can't wait to watch again. None of Nolan's movies have disappointed me on multiple viewings."
217," Avoid
",This movie is trying so hard being logically complex to the extend it make no sense whatsoever .Waste of time
218," Amazing
","Tenet is a practically perfect (re)introduction to the big screen. Whether audiences are ready - where safe - to return to cinemas en masse is another question entirely. Certainly, Tenet's a more challenging film than some may be comfortable with after a five-month absence, but this is an all-too-rare example of a master filmmaker putting everything on the table with, you sense, not a modicum of his vision compromised. The stakes have never been higher, but Tenet is exactly the film cinemas need right now."
219," Must watch
","Excellent movie, concept story and everything as great, only reason that its getting a 9 instead of a 10 is because of the sound in the cinema, too loud and unpleasent at times, also the talking was slightly muddled at certain spots in my opinion, otherwise great movie"
220," Didn't get it
","Watched for an hour but didn't understand what was going on, kept asking my partner but didn't wanna bother him every 10 minutes cause nothing just made sense. Wouldn't even want to watch it back again cause just wasn't interesting at all. Disappointed seeing as it has such a high rating."
221," Tenet: a director's film with no clothes
","Crap movie, zero emotional movement, no character development, pointless dialogue. One big spectacle used to hide it's glaring flaws. It's complexity is a farce to hide it's illogical inconsistencies while trying to force the spectator to splash more cash on wasted repeated viewings. It was like the director had zero interest in actually giving the audience a good experience but rather wanted them to admire his ""craft skills"".There was no synchronicity between the protagonist and the plot and zero emotional stakes. Ask yourself this, what actually was driving the main protagonist? Why does it matter to him? You could have replaced the main character with any other personality, flaws, drive and the movie would not have been affected one iota.And the antagonist?!? Tell me again his motivation for causing world war 3? And why did this have to involve inversion again? And what is the use of an antagonist or a protagonist when the latter just literally fights himself just so he can fight himself to stop himself from stopping himself just so he can achieves nothing which somehow allows the protagonist to achieve something which actually doesn't accomplish anything. So the antagonist literally achieved more against himself than the protagonist. So who was whose worse enemy??!? AND tell me again what the protagonist was actually trying to do again? This is what the modern world calls ""deep"".Tenet's ""complexity"" is nothing but a cheap trick to make dumb reviewers and moviegoers applaud a movie at their own expense. Any person with common sense would realise the emperor is wearing no clothes.Why pay for something and fall for a director's clever yet completely egotistical mindgame to make pawns of you and your wallets? This movie spits in the face of all the actually good complex movies of the past that actually had something to say and most importantly elevated it's audience beyond its own medium. There is literally nothing to take home from Tenet... It is just loud empty noise and will pass like a fart in the wind."
222," You need a degree in time travel to enjoy this
","Bad casting. Unconvincing acting. Unlikeable, one dimensional characters. Annoying dialogue you can barely hear because of mumbling or loud background noise. Exposition galore. Pointless and nonsensical action scenes. Cliché bad guy. Trying to be too clever. Waste of time and money."
223," Time-ception with a ruthless score
","After watching it a second time I now feel like this is a masterpiece. Both in filmmaking, story telling and score. I'd highly recommend seeing it at least twice for you probably won't get it all during your first watch.It's like watching a visual puzzle, searching for clues (like birds flying backwards or waves acting weird) while being surprised by the bold and ruthless score. Not only the music is unapologetic, every bullet shot sounds like it's going straight into concrete. There's something merciless about it all. Combined with the relaxed - sometimes even understated - acting it makes you wonder what it is you're looking at. Like: everything suggests there's something large and important going on. Then why do I feel the main characters do not seem to take it very seriously? It wasn't until my second time watching it that I understood what was going on. At least, that's how I feel now... I'm planning on seeing it again soon, to check my theories (and to enjoy all those magnificent suits again).Main clue in my opinion? 'This whole operation is a temporal pincer'."
224," Prepare to stretch your understanding of reality
","This movie is a masterpiece wrapped in an enigma of physics. Nolan uses ""time"" as a plot device (as he loves to do in his movies) in a way that has never been done before on the big screen before. If you like puzzles, you'll love unpacking the storyline of Tenet.Now I have to admit, the plot IS confusing. But how could it not be when events are unfolding backwards and forwards at the same time in the same space. But this is exactly what makes this movie so brilliant. Nolan's ability to take alternating directions of time and weave them together in a way that they interact with each other to drive the story forward is nothing short of genius. If you are confused by the end of the movie, watch an explanation video on YouTube. Then watch the movie again and you'll appreciate just how complex and masterful this movie really is.Simply some of the most fun I've had watching a movie in years. Nolan is hands down the best sci-fi director of this generation."
225," Abysmal
","Truly awful. I can't even begin to lay out everything wrong with this film. Leaving aside the consistency of the 'time-travel' aspect; cinematically it doesn't work.There were so many scenes which didn't progress the story whatsoever, and just served as a really awful dialogue exposition of story information, blegh, this is bad even for crappy TV dramas, where characters repetitively walk through streets or corridors talking and giving detailed story exposition, but to see this in a major blockbuster Hollywood film is just depressing.The time travel was gimmicky, and needlessly complicated. So many characters served no real purpose and were a waste of screen-time. And the motivations of the characters were completely absent, it was totally unconvincing. Why did the scary Russian man want to destroy the world? cause he had cancer and was sad?? really? Why did the main protagonist want to save the woman so bad? There was no connection or chemistry, at the start of the film he tells the other agent he would take women and children hostage if he needed to, setting him up as a ruthless character, yet halfway through the film he compromises his mission, the object and information to save a woman he has no connection with, so I guess its cause he's a good guy right? Well no, actually he was supposed to fail all along! so then he could actually succeed.... mind=blown, man!!!1! terrible, empty characters and story, leaving the viewing experience irritatingly loud, flashy, action sequences that drag on far too long. 1/10"
226," Thrilling till the end
","One of the most thrilling movies i have seen, never looked on my watch, because it was so interesting. Music was outstanding.
A really good movie to go back to the theaters after this long time."
227," One point for good acting, another for looking pretty
","As someone who really enjoyed other Nolan movies like The Dark Knight, and Interstellar, this movie is just categorically bad.It's basically a bland James Bond knock-off with a secret agent taking on a villain on a yacht, except there's a confusing time travel gimmick meaning the characters sometimes move backwards in time instead of forwards. The way the movie presents this is complete and utter nonsense, but fine let's suspend our disbelief.When I say confusing, the reason is not that it's a particularly hard concept to grasp (it's not), but because the film goes out of its way to make it difficult to understand. First of all, all the dialog is muffled so if you want to understand more than the occasional word you have to watch it with subtitles. Then when you watch it with subtitles, you realize why they muffled the dialog - it's because it mostly consists of incomprehensible gibberish.After a lot of meandering and the occasional set piece, this all this culminates in a badly choreographed big battle scene where the movie fails to actually show you who the good guys are fighting against, making the whole thing look like a live fire exercise instead of an actual battle.By this point though it's hard to care anyway. Even though the acting is as good as you'd expect, there's little character development and once you strip the time travel gimmick away, the plot boils down to a straight forward hunt for a McGuffin.Wished I'd followed my instincts and stopped watching before I got to the end."
228," This Left Me Cold
","What a dreadful movie. Bad acting, ridiculously confused story line, bad dialogue, disappointing sound and a mish mash of moments copied from other far superior movies. Christopher Nolan: you are better than this!"
229," Terrible sound
","We made the mistake of buying this without subtitles. I could only understand about 25% of the dialogue. The sound was poor, the lead actor was disappointing and did not speak at all clearly. There is no excuse for such poor sound in a movie that cost so much to make."
230," It's good
","This movie is a wild ride, but not always in a good way. Some of the movie makes very little sense. Still, cool action and great acting."
231," A Fantastic Mental Exercise
","Stop complaining about the movie being confusing. The plot is still graspable. No you couldn't get it in the 3 hours you watched it but, you get to obsess about it for the next week. which I find fascinating. Not many movies can do that. I say a round of applause for Christopher Nolan. Once again, you've done it!"
232," Complexity above entertainment?
","One hour and thirty minutes in, this was the point I officially lost the plot. For the final hour I sat back, enjoyed the action set pieces, marvelled in the sound mixing but the plot was put out to pasture for me. Without completely spoiling for those yet to see it, Tenet is Christopher Nolan set loose on the manipulation of time as we know it. But that, that's only half the story here, because a lesson in physics isn't fully complete without government espionage set across multiple countries. But what really frustrates me is the potential this had going into the final hour. Two well built relationships, a budding cop comedy set up between lead and BFF Pattinson and an extremely well written vengeful hatred between husband and wife. What could have been. Six out of ten is my ultimate pick, but this deserved more, and ultimately entertainment, sitting back and enjoying a thrillingly paced film was sacrificed for an over complex exploration into scientific theory."
233," Another fantastic movie by the master himself nolan
","Tenet was a movie that I was really really excited for because of how unique the trailers made it out to be and I have to say this movie is fantastic but it also is very confusing and would take a couple of viewings to figure out which in my opinion I love because I love to do reviewing a of movies. But what makes tenet so special is just how unique it is compared to say Christopher Nolan's other movies like Dunkirk and the dark knight movies and other movies he has directed because I have to say I haven't seen a movie like this before. What also makes this movie so Great is the cast and I have to say everyone in this movie is fantastic from John David Washington to Robert Pattinson to Elizabeth debicki everyone just kills it in there roles. The action in this movie also is fantastic and super well shot and with the time manipulation concept it helps cause some amazing fights. The music also is just amazing from Tyler Scott's original song the plan to the fantastic score by Ludwig Göransson who obviously takes inspiration from some of the best. The story even though it's not the most original adds some super unique concepts to this movie that sets it apart from other movie and I love that. The villain played by Kenneth Branagh is fantastic and super Threatening. The movie also is super wellshot and looks fantastic. The one problem I have with this movie but it's a very small nitpick is at times it's very hard to tell what the characters are saying because of the audio mix it's a very minor problem that only happened once or twice but it didn't really take me out of the experience. Overall, I adored tenet from start to finish if you have the chance please go support this movie either at your local drive in or if your theaters are open and you feel safe enough to go, GO SUPPORT THIS MOVIE!"
234," Typical Nolan
",Can't hear anyone speak. Ear bleeding in parts. Huge practical set up effects. Intriguing and original story. But ultimately soulless.The lead actor is really really bad at acting he gives such a stale performance it looks like he is acting. Like he is on screen and you can tell he is trying to carefully remember what he's doing. Terrible.Storyline is clever and it's visually brilliant but it is a run by the numbers nolan flick.It's worth going to see on the big screen but you will come out of the cinema with a sore head from having your eyebrow raised to the roof for 2.5 hours.Nowhere near Nolan's best.
235," Terrible movie not worth wasting your time on
",I am not sure what movie these other reviewers were watching or how many of them are being paid to give good reviews but that was not the movie I watched for 2.5 hours of my life I can never get back. The entire plot was so utterly ridiculous and unbelievable. I love sci fi movies and really love time travel movies but this plot was a joke. They want you to believe if something (like a person or a bullet) is sent back in time they become inverted so they or it in the case of a bullet moves backwards compared to their surroundings. WTF ?? They want you to believe that once your transported back in time you continue to travel backwards in time and do not stop at your selected destination. The acting was OK but not award-winning by any means. Its not action packed either as I fell asleep 3 times trying to get through this movie. At the end they come up with another crazy plot for the end of the world which again is ridiculous. This is the first time travel movie I have disliked.
236," Mind Bending!
","Just like every other Nolan movie, each moment is a puzzling factor and it never disappoints!"
237," Rubik's cube of time travel
","A mind bending rubik's cube that only a few of us can solve. The only drawback was the sound mixing, the dialogues were hard to follow in some scenes. Apart from that, it is a masterpiece.Washington, Pattinson and Debicky's performance was really good. Amazing stunt sequence, background music, etc, etc. And above all it's a Nolan movie.If Inception is dream within a dream this is time travel within time travel."
238," No Clue
","I had absolutely no idea what was going on from start to finish, on top of that the sound was terrible with muffled voices and over loud action scenes.I am a massive fan of the SCIFI genre, but this was one of the worst supposedly blockbuster SCIFI movies I have seen in a long time, and thats unfortunate as myself and lots of other people had been looking forward to the release of this movie."
239," Brilliant
","Nolan doesn't miss, period. Read the negative reviews, the overwhelming majority give Tenet 1 star citing they either a. Couldn't follow the plot b. Couldn't hear the dialogue or c. Both. Not to sound pretentious but while there are several clues/elements of the plot that I did not pick up on upon initial viewing, it doesn't take a genius to at least understand the general happenings of the film. Visually stunning and well worth the watch, an ambitious work that I thoroughly enjoyed. Ignore the plebes"
240," Terrible
","Nolan is visionary, but this was nonsense. I love spy movies, time travel movies, action movies, etc... but damn this was jus convoluted bs. Very disappointed"
241," Masterpiece
",Duh you are watching some parallel universe time travelling past and future complex right here so yes it's complicated ... start it if you are going to completely focus ... be prepared because the moment you blink you loose track of every thing happening and you might need to watch it more than once but the moment you understand it you will appreciate every single shot in it ... MASTER PIECE ... well done to a crazy point .
242," Incredible cinema, Nolan does it again
","As a massive, long-time fan of Christopher Nolan films, I was anxiously awaiting the release of this film. The pandemic pushed this films release back several months which only added to the anticipation, as well as the high expectations. I can honestly say that what he's released here is nothing short of cinematic magic. After the first viewing I was completely confounded by what I had seen. I knew I enjoyed the film and had an amazing experience, but I had so many questions that I didn't even know where to start. I was able to superficially understand the plot and have an appreciation for it, but there was so much underlying substance and nuance to unpack that I knew I needed at least two viewings to really appreciate it. If you're looking for rich character development you won't find it here. This film essentially moves between highly fervid action sequences which are masterfully done, and sharp exposition that attempts to explain the plot and mechanics by which this world operates within. I will admit that there are times in which the score beats you over the head with blaring intensity and you find yourself struggling to hear the dialogue, but for the most part it's absolutely amazing and adds to the experience in a dazzling way. Make no mistake, this film is tedious and mind-bending, but the pay-off makes it all worth it in the most classic Nolan way. Just be prepared to mentally go to work when you watch this film. Either way, Nolan continues to break ground with his trend of highly ambitious and ground-breaking cinema combined with excessively commercial and accessible at the same time."
243," Absolute masterpiece if you think about it.
","I already liked the movie at the first watch, but I saw it a second time in IMAX and it is amazing. Its visually stunning and has a great story line which has no plot holes in my opinion. But I had to figure it all out first and if you watch it with knowing whats happening in mind its truly amazing, awesome and a masterpiece!
The music is absolutly stunning and fits perfect!"
244," 'Feel it, don't try to understand it' - it's the only way.
","My Rating : 9/10Refreshing Sci-fi that must be experienced, 'felt' rather than 'understood' - Activate your Red brain and just let the action/drama take over your instincts.It's very confusing and perhaps not really as engaging as 'Inception' or 'Interstellar' - I didn't understand much but what I can conclude is that it's a fight-flight-freeze movie rather than a logical-memory-language oriented one.I enjoyed the amount of thought and hard work that went into it - it's just 'Tenet', man."
245," Great
","At it's core Tenet is a classic spy/espionage/thriller but in traditional Nolan fashion he has to throw in his twists and curves but that's what makes Nolan, Nolan.I've only seen Tenet once so far and definitely have plans for multiple viewings as the inversion part of the film is rather complicated. It's made more so with how hard it is to understand/hear the dialogue. I saw this film in IMAX so the loud affects and score drowns out the actors. This made even more annoying due to how short exposition scenes are for a concept that's rather complex. I felt the explanation of what is the films feature concept ""inversion"" to be poor, but this could be due to how difficult at times it was to hear/understand making me wish for subtitles. Other than this issue I thought the film was great the characters, the actors delivered great performances especially John David Washington as ""the protagonist""The films score while I thought was great personally I felt Hans Zimmer's absence and this will most likely not even be something the general audience would recognize. Cinematography phenomenal, special affects beautiful especially in IMAX. I would highly recommend watching this film in IMAX usually I would believe how you choose to watch a film in whatever format is an opinion and personal preference. This is just not the case in my opinion for Tenet I saw it in IMAX but not true IMAX. I could see and feel I wasn't getting everything so I would say this is a must watch in 70mm IMAX. After seeing it I understand why Nolan is adamant on his film being viewed in theaters and in 70mm.Overall while I thoroughly enjoyed this film I find myself feeling somewhat disappointed and left wanting. Which is a very foreign feeling for me when it comes to Nolan as I have loved every single film of his immensely. Perhaps this is end of my honeymoon phase with Nolan but I'm hoping after multiple viewings I will understand and enjoy it more.8/10"
246," Typical Christopher Nolan movie
",What more you expect from a genius? Christopher Nolan movies are not for dumbs even the wise ones need 2-3 viewings before they fully grasp of the happenings. Masterpiece after Interstellar worth risking myself to go watch in theatre in this mess
247," This movie deserves a way higher rating.....
","Just going through the comments and pretty much all of them are saying ""audio is bad"", ""confusing as hell"", ""bad acting"", ""worst Nolan film"", etc. If I'm being completely honest, this WAS part of my reaction after the first watch. But after the second watch, this movie has just proven to be one of my top three Nolan films. IT IS, LITERALLY, A MASTERPIECE. The audio was spot on (seriously) because it created so much intensity and strength to the whole film. Some actors are hiding some information in some scenes (no spoilers) so it looks like they aren't great actors. However, it is because they are hinting the viewers which inversion phase they're in. Yes, I know it is confusing, that's just because each character has different inversion phase. You just have to watch it multiple time for everything to click in your head. There are timeline graphs for each character on the Internet. Look into it, watch the film again, and re-rate this movie, PLEASE.THIS MOVIE SERIOUSLY DESERVES A WAY HIGHER RATING."
248," Inception on steroids.
","What a masterpiece. I have never been this excited after watching a movie, even after watching Endgame does not make me feel this kind of excitement. Sorry Marvel. I am speechless after the movie. It feels so satisfying.
If you can, find the biggest cinema screen that have the loudest speaker (Ludwig Goransson you are the best) in your area to watch this movie. You can thank me later. Seriously, go and watch it."
249," Watch it in IMAX, or never watch it!
","This is again, a masterpiece made by the mastermind Christopher Nolan, the audio and visual experience in IMAX is something unreal!
This is incomparable, indescribable experience, a feast for your eyes and ears, and a trance, an ecstasy for your mind, only if you're smart enough to keep up with that unusual world of tenet, the nonlinear storytelling makes it even more and more satisfying.Yet, a pain in the brain, a headache for those people with limited brain abilities wanting to enjoy something easy, simple, and linear.Music?
top notch, surprisingly astonishing, makes your heart beat with every second, takes you from the first moment to the last moment in a journey of extreme chills.
Ludwig has done the work we've been hoping for, and even surpasses that!
Hans zimmer is proud.Visuals?
Just real shit! No avengers there, only real people, real cars, real action, it takes you inside the movie!Cinematography?
Couldn't be any better.Story? Acting? Editing? e.t.c.
10/10Watching all Nolan movies, many times, taught me something!
Some movies are subject to comparisons with their rivals, but some aren't, simply because you'll never find rivals for those movies, no similar ideas, no such implementations ever done before, no such genre has ever been created before.Watch Nolan's movies and never try to compare them to anything else, Nolan creates his own genres, TENET is a totally new genre of movies, and a never before seen or felt experience, watch it and enjoy it.It doesn't matter whether you like the movie or not, the truth is TENET is incomparable to anything else ever done, if Nolan's movies are incomparable, then TENET is on the top of the list.Whether you left the theater in ecstasy or rage and hatred, be sure that the more you'll think about the magnificence of that feast, the more you'll love and appreciate this movie."
250," Kept me on the edge of my seat!
",My gosh! I literally sat on the edge of my seat for the entire show! The movie was gripping and exciting and unpredictable with little pockets of funny.Washington and Pattison paired perfectly on screen. Washington was a perfect choice for this role. At first I was skeptical but man I couldn't take my eyes off him.The movie goes back and forth and when it does you say oh and ah that's what that was. My gosh. I definitely will watch again. Man if covid did not exist this movie would have been huge!
251," Masterpiece
",Tenet appears to be one of the most misunderstood and ergo underrated movies.
252," Don't think you're so smart if you like this movie!
","Yea yeah... Allies good, others evil, cold war BS, CIA so humane! White western woman saved from the evil eastern man since 100 years ago...
it's a smart-pretend movie for dumb people buying same old propaganda BS wrapped in a vomit of the new physics to make people feel dumb if they don't believe it..."
253," Don't overthink it
","This has it all - phenomenal acting, amazing soundtrack, car chases ... and a seriously thoughtful story line and script, which is so rare these days. Is it loud - yes, fantastically so. Are parts of the dialogue difficult to understand - yes, because they're part of the soundtrack or inverted. You're missing exactly nothing. Is the storyline convoluted - absolutely. Does it matter - no. You don't have to be amazingly smart to get this film. Just suspend disbelief a little and get behind the intent. And watch it again if you really want to figure it out."
254," Mind blowing
","This film is not like any other films, mind bending. The soundtrack is absolutely stunning."
255," Best time travel movie so far
","This is in my opinion the best movie made about time travel. Just as you'd expect from Nolan, the plot is complex and layered, and it employs a novel concept (or rather, mechanic) that provides great visuals and action scenes. It is a bit lacking in emotional and thematic depth, but that is not the focus of the movie. It is extremely satisfying when in the last half of the movie, the details you didn't understand until then start to make sense."
256," Amazing
","If the directors for Endgame chose the same theories to guide their plot (and consistently stuck with the same concepts so that they wouldn't contradict themselves), I wouldn't have hated it so much. The way they filmed Tenet is so cool. The actors did absolutely brilliant jobs, especially considering the fact that they had to act out so much in reverse. I was sad to see that Hans Zimmer was absent for this film, but Göransson did an excellent job and really was able to enhance the experience of this movie. Once again, Christopher Nolan has made another masterpiece. I lived for the plot. My only critique is that Branagh's beard is... disturbing."
257," My favorite movie of the year
","The movie is thrilling with action. Backwards, time inversion and lots of confusing scenes. Tenet is a perfect movie to watch."
258," Entertaining action with excellent performances
","Even though it is a bit hard to follow it's still one of Nolan's better movies. It really shows what cinema can achieve and it is a proof that both J. D. Washington and Robert Pattinson have bright future ahead pf them.
Certainly this movie can't compete with The Dark Knight or Inception but few movies out there were as daring and as ambitious as it was Tenet."
259," Let it age awhile and it will emerge a masterpiece
","Taste in film is subjective. Either you like it or you don't. Though sometimes you might learn to love it (The Shining, Shawshank, to name a few that have aged well).I myself was hooked from the first scene (or fifth or ninth, I'm not really sure yet). I love that one doesn't ease in to the story as is the general principle in storytelling. You're not supposed to ease into this one. You're supposed to smash right into it, just like our protagonist is smashed in to the middle of his own story (or is it his own creation? I'm not really sure of that either). You're not merely following a story here, you're following a chain of events (or a cluster of events if you'd like) from the view of our present day protagonist. As we follow our protagonist on his journey along the string of time the knots ultimately loosens. To me that is brilliant storytelling.As the movie ages and you see it again and again, all the details you missed in the first viewings will make it grow and perhaps TENET will emerge as a masterpiece in time."
260," A master piece by Mr nolan
","Just like inception this movie is also a bit complicated but that's what nolan movies are all about..... A spy thriller with scifi components in it makes it even more intriguing.
This movie really is fire.
Visual effects are also awesome.
A must watch film."
261," This is great
",This film is so so so great everything is good i love so much robert patinson in christor nolan i love the action in this movie and the writing is so so so much great i really need see this again

","Tenet, the best thing that happened in 2020
God bless Nolan"
263," Don't forget your ear defenders
","The movie is the loudest i have ever experienced. Absolutely deafening gun fire and music. Then I could barely hear or understand the dialogue, which went so fast it was difficult to process the information overload to try and make sense of what we had just seen. It got to the point where i gave ip caring. The lead actor was out of his depth. Jake Gylenhall would have been a better choice. The film was very disappointing indeed."
264," Another masterpiece from the best director going round
","'Tenet' is great. And that's not just because I finally saw a film in the cinema again! It's definitely not a ""time travel"" movie - it's a fast-paced, layered the-whole-world's-at-stake spy film, with some added mind-bending ""inversion"" included. For mine, this is better than 'Interstellar' & 'Dunkirk', but not quite the greatness of 'Inception' or 'The Prestige'. Still, Nolan's bar is so high, and this ticks so many boxes.The first 5min are so hectic and unrelenting, and rather than taking some time to pause and fill us in, the plot moves briskly as we follow the Protagonist (Washington - what a beard!) as he teams up with Neil (Pattinson) and are left to fill in some of the gaps - which I appreciate - rather than have them spoon fed to us. We then figure out how the villain (Branagh) - wish he had a better motivation - & his unwilling wife Kat (Debicki) fit in, as they do a Bond-esque globe-trotting - India, Estonia, Norway, England, Italy.Reminds me of 'Recursion' (by Blake Crouch) which I just read, but still a very unique take on the spy genre. Action galore, car chases, high stakes, exceptional score, and some truly amazing cinematography. Some of the ""inverse"" fight scenes and car stunts are extraordinary. It's all helped by how likeable and assured Washington is as the lead. Some of it's a bit confusing, but there's no time wasted getting into physics ""what-ifs"". Long-ish at 2.5 hours, but it whips by."
265," Sorry but no
","When a filmmaker gets to write, direct and co-produce a pet project it can either be a masterpiece (Coppola's Apocalypse Now) or a total mess driven by vanity (Nolan's Tenet)Just what was he thinking? Surely the editor could have at least said No! you can't have a confused looking Washington nod at the word 'Paradox' then move swiftly on to the next incomprehensible plotless scene acting like he knows what's going on.This is Nolan's disaster. His Heaven's Gate. Hopefully it's not the end of his career as Memento and Inception were good."
266," sadly can't give 0 stars
","The movie was extremely confusing and I barely knew what was happening. At the end of the movie I realised I just wasted my money and time. You might call me an idiot and I ""just don't get the movie"" but let's be real, do you even remember the name of the main character?"
267," What a piece of garbage
","I'm clicking the thumbs down on every Nolan fan boy and hollywood cronies reviews here on this site.If you want to waste your time and your money on this overrated (as usual) C. Nolan movie, go ahead and do it.An absolute nonsense that will leave you wondering what is wrong with the writer of this garbage. Impossible to enjoy anything here, to feel anything or to care about the flattest characters ever.I'm done with this pseudointellectual Hollywood filmaker. If there's something I have to thank Nolan after watching this is that I just made the decision of not paying a dime to see any other piece of trash he makes, ever."
268," Ferociously Entertaining, Nolan is back with bang
","Sir Christopher Nolan has saved Cinema once again. Thank you so much 😘. A must watch film. Clearly Nolan has set the bench mark above all.. It's really mind bending, beautiful film which I was in complete awe at the highest level of film making.. How the hell was he able to pull that off.. This is the classic film. The way film is directed, the technical achievement of film are faar too great.. It's like Nolan has raised the standard of what form of film making we would watch 10-15 years from now
For complete cinematic experience watch it only in theatres. Tenet definitely gets an A"

",Nolan did it again. The best movie I have ever seen in my life
271," Intense and confusing, but that's part of the fun
","This movie took my breath away. It was an intense, non-stop two and a half hours trying to piece together the story. But I think that's part of the fun. Great performances. There's nobody else making movies like Christopher Nolan. I still don't understand everything, but I can't wait to watch this again. Maybe next time with subtitles."
272," 2020 was a good year for this to come out
","The first 40 minutes moved at warp speed. Almost like every gap in the conversation had been cut out to save time. Felt like Amy Sherman-Palladino was directing with rapid fire conversation like that.It got better as it went on, but like most mediocre action movie the characters were terrible and the plot did most of the leg work.I'll never watch this again."
273," When you understand it.... one hell of a movie
",This movie very hard to follow. The beginning is very vague and that is why its difficult to understand the point of the story. But if you get threw all that you see one hell of a movie with plot twists and little hidden throwbacks to tie up the story.
274," Don't waste 2½ hours of your life , ,,I only wasted 2 hours. !!
","Pretensious Rubbish
Reminds me of the "" Emperor's New Clothes"" !!
The director (whoever he is) thinks he's much too clever for the audience.
It's totally incomprehensible to me.
I have an IQ of only 140 and I am 75 y.o
So that maybe that's my problem.
But I do have some understanding of Entropy which basically is simple,but this film seems to build a whole new concept around it,which technically is impossible.
That's fair enough in a sci fi film ,but I couldn't even enjoy it for its entertainment content, Since due to terrible incoherent speech and excessive sound volume. Mind you if it hadn't been for the Noise, I probably would have fallen asleep with boredom !
I don't always object to loud noise in its place,,,, Dunkirk was a fantastic film and very noisy .(Must have had a better director)
I certainly will not waste another 2½ hours of my life watching it again to see if I can make it more decipherable."

277," ABSOLUTE TRASH!!
","Incompetent on every level.An incoherent story, atrocious casting, dull performances, confusing concept, plot points that have no obvious connection. A threat that is hurredly described and not shown in any helpful way.Even the special effects are lacklustre, reverse footage (not exactly groundbreaking) and some very wobbly miniature-looking miniatures.No scene logically connects to the next scene, the first 20 minutes feels like very poor editing, and the final 20 minutes is a dull retreading of the previous 2 hours of film we've had to endure. Many times I held my head in my hands in confusion, in pain at the effort to understand important pieces of plot delivered over roaring helicopter blades or muffled through gas masks.Some truly comically jarring elements in the climax and point of highest tension in the film, defused rather unsatisfyingly.None of the plot twists will be a surprise to anyone with a functioning optical capacity.And massively distracting to have a leading lady 8 feet taller than the leading man.The only saving grace is that the film was lit. I could literally see what was happening. That is all.Garbage!"
278," Block Fruster - Dissapointing Review Part II
","The scheme of the film was more or less the same: mission, dialogue, mission, dialogue, mission... (or first dialogue then mission...). However, the dialogues were so meaningless that they were of no use except for time consumption. They didn't really get you anywhere, they were too empty and flat for that. The missions on the other hand were quite strange for me. Mission: I want to break into a warehouse. What to do (and what is most complicated?). I hijack a plane of the tax authorities (?), which is transporting tons of gold, and race into the warehouse. Does that make sense? No, not really, but it makes action. And the best thing is, in the movie it's no problem, no difficulties, stupid guards, no obstacles. Capturing an airplane, that's something I can do. The main thing is a few nice effects.
When things got tight, there was always a door opening somewhere (example ship: door to the engine room...). It was a bit like having an unemotional artist on a wire rope, secured with a thick rope and you know exactly that when he falls nothing happens to him. There was just no tension. Also, to break the circle by simply cutting the safety line in the film, that was probably too much to ask. The film could not offer that.
What was it like in the movie? The secret agent had just stolen the plutonium. The oligarch comes along in another car and brings his wife with him. There is a car chase on the highway until both vehicles are speeding along side by side. What does the oligarch do? He says I would like the plutonium (which is actually part of a secret code / algorithm), otherwise I will kill the woman I brought with me. And what does the secret agent do (it's all about humanity), oh yes, no problem here it is (o.k. in reality the suitcase was empty, but so what). How he then stops the other car (it is speeding towards the end of a traffic jam), you have to have seen - and if you are honest with yourself, you would have to leave the cinema afterwards. What would Lt. Col. Devoe have done in this situation? - and it was all about a few cheap nuclear missiles.
The story itself is even more challenging for me. In the future, a scientist invents a way to travel back in time. She realizes that the invention might not be that good after all, she splits it into 9 parts (the codes / algorithms), sends it back in time and the goal is to find the parts again and unite them so that the world can end. And this is on the initiative of the future population, which holds the current population responsible for the exploitation of the world and for all environmental damage. Aha. But somehow this is not unknown to me, so somehow between Terminator, a quota scientist (wasn't there a scientist responsible for the quantum weapon in Mortal Engines too?) and Aquaman, where the underwater inhabitants wanted to defend themselves against the destruction of the environment, to name a few current ones,... I don't want to talk about the splitting into 9 fragments or parts (Infinity stones, various mummy movies etc.). Wouldn't it have been easier to destroy the thing right in the future?
I have already mentioned the rather emotionless behaviour of the main character several times. In contrast, the super agent James Bond is a universe of character. You have to keep in mind that the movie cost almost a quarter of a billion dollars, but it is also a Nolan movie. Mother/son - secret agent - villain and a little bit of end of the world. Somehow I can think of comparisons with certain ""low budget"" movies with a similar setting, ""Reset"", a Chinese film with mother/daughter and time loop from 2017. A typical Chinese film, with pathos, exaggeration. IMDb somewhere around 5. If you ignore the first 5 minutes and watch the next 30, it was somehow more coherent in the plot than tenet and (at least in the time I watched it - o.k. I watched it completely) picked me up emotionally better. Even though the main actress suddenly has no problem handling a pistol. Whereby, tenet has also shown that an art historian makes a good assassin (don't get the idea that this is not realistic!). Or even mother/daughter in ""Hai Phuong"", 2019, Vietnam, especially the last half hour has carried me away more than tenet did. It is all about emotions! And, to exaggerate if you like musicals, I found Rocky Handsome, 2016, somehow more impressive (even if he didn't get the best reviews), this time not mother/daughter, but ""father""/daughter and a remake at the same time. What I wanted to say with the examples, there are other filmmakers who are not the highly praised ""masterminds"", who at least in a small way, make films that are interesting for me (and they don't have to be available in E). And yes, I was unfair to the films with ""cheap (low budget) home movies"" - I liked them.
But back to tenet. What exactly the codes / algorithms were and what they could do remained in the dark. I could have said heretical now, since the film would have had to explain something. Also the story (actually a side story) with the 12 million painting (which felt like ¼ of the film) remained rather unclear for me, since it did not advance the story from my point of view. The other actors also remained rather pale for me. They had no background story and therefore no ""life"", one could just as well have used wooden figures, they were just there.
Actually the end scene could have been a highlight. With forward/backward actions. In a deserted former Russian secret town. But for me it was not. The city looked very different from the way you know Russian cities from documentaries (Oil-City was even more tangible, lovingly and real for me), on the other hand the soldiers ran for miles on open space, and there were also soldiers from the enemy, although a bomb was supposed to explode in a few minutes. The fights themselves were difficult for me to describe as such. In another recession, they were compared to paintball games, and yes, that's what I like best. It had more of a game character than a real fight.
And then, just before the end, the bad guy (or one of his employees) almost wins, just one more push of a button - and what happens, the thing jams, not just once or twice. This of course gives the hero the opportunity to turn the whole thing around! How nice. That was a real low point in the film for me. I'm sorry, for a film with the resume and the budget these are things I can't forgive. That was just weak for me.
The running gag, ""who recruited you?"", fitted for me to the level of the film (in the sense of an innovative story) - ""who is Sophie Neveu?"", for me it wasn't funny, but at best it was a copy of another film - and by the way, he, the protagonist, will play an important role in the future, he just doesn't know it yet. Have you ever heard it somewhere else?
Some topics were just illogical for me. The film represented the thesis, or rather showed that the ""grandfather paradox"" doesn't exist, i.e. you could erase yourself or your ancestor and didn't have to worry about yourself (unless you meet yourself in the past, then that's not good - with exceptions, fighting against yourself is possible). This means that you can create infinite clones of yourself or the algorithm components with the ""back machines"" that seem to be standing around every street corner (both the bad guy and the ""good"" secret organization had some). With a little thought, this could have made the whole thing much easier. And actually, ""Dark"" with its inner logic and the motivations of the actors (including their emotions) seems to me almost like a revelation in comparison. Also it was not so clear to me, why the future population wanted to completely wipe out the current one, wouldn't targeted interventions in history be more effective?
So what is my conclusion?
A brief summary of the history: Evil Russian oligarch with a difficult childhood and a psychotic woman who wants to kill him has the desire to destroy the world because he himself is terminally ill and therefore cannot own the world, or if he is dead, no one else should live either (yes, it is really as outrageous as it sounds). Fortunately, there is a good western (quota) black secret agent, who prevents this almost single-handedly. Actually a pearl of storytelling, because it has already proven itself a hundred times in other films. That would probably be too much copy, so we take a ""time-back machine"", even if it has no real use and it's not explained, but it's different then and gives some nice effects. When I think of how many highly paid and creative screenwriters have probably been involved. It probably would have been better to have spent 3-4 thousand dollars more on a decent script, but with all the action, you didn't have any money left.
The story has considerable logic holes for me, the motivation and the character drawing of the villain is not comprehensible or mature at all for me. The story itself has for me one or the other (rather more than less) borrowings from other films and, in order not to make it too difficult for the secret agent, many coincidences that prevent the worst from happening. For me, that is simply far too little for a film with these boundary conditions. Even for an Asylum film (if it had received a production release with the setting at all) it would not even be mediocre for me. Therefore 3 out of 10 .
Nevertheless it is currently the only block fruster. So go to the cinema, if necessary with a sleep mask and earplugs, but go!"
279," The Emperor's Film
","Anyone giving this close 10/10 is deluded. I teach science and have a fairly decent grasp of the laws of thermodynamics, but this was way too complicated. The sound was terrible and by the end I had forgotten certain key points about the algorithm that wrapped the film up (mainly how the algorithm brought about the end of the world and needed to be buried - still non- plussed). You shouldn't need a notebook in a film. I think that the poor sound quality, length and unnecessary complicated plot are designed for people to watch it a second time...? Well, it won't be me."
280," boring
","Very boring, bad dialogue like from a student film, bungee jumpable?"
281," No - just no
","First time I've ever left a review on IMDB. I'm still seething for the lost time and money. This film is devoid of merit. I've enjoyed the majority of this director's output, had no issue with the casting or central premise, but the execution was bordering on the insulting. Wooden acting, stilted dialogue. Pointless set pieces, delivered without care or interest in wanting to engage the viewer. My only enjoyment was hoping that the 'baddie' got his way and ended this mess. I 'got' the point, but the point was pointless. (Spoiler) Watching a hired army (whose motivation I had no idea on) running backwards, while another bunch ran forward was comical, yawn-inducing, and dull, dull, dull. This truly was French and Saunders does Inception, without the intentional laughs. I genuinely felt that Nolan was sticking a middle finger up at points and I don't appreciate the gag. I'd prefer to watch a season of Mrs Brown's Boys. Don't pretend it is good - it is ok to dislike this but enjoy Nolan's work either side of it. Tenot."
282," Worth seeing on big screen
","In typical fashion it's been executed well. The sound was loud at the beginning and quieter around other parts but is likely to do with the cinema I saw it at. Was a brilliant story, didn't give much time for the viewer to process the plausibility of what's happening a lot like inception with enough 'depth/layers' to the plot much like inception to see it a second time. And I'm sure you'll pick up on thing last you missed the first time."
283," Emotionless pseudointellectual crap
","Nolan movies are all lacking character developement and emotions. They are like a designer couch nobody wants to sit on, because at first glance it looks extraordinary, but the more you look at it you think it's all concept and function but what's most important isn't there: it isn't emotional and doesn't touch your heart! Christopher Nolan movies are all pseudo intellectual! He tries to be so smart and intelligent that he forgets that feelings and emotions make a good movie and when it's smart and clever it will be a very good movie. When you don't care about the protagonists anymore the director has failed. To carry this metaphor further in Tenet Christopher Nolan showed everybody again that he is able to design a sofa that's maybe different and unusual, but he fails to make it comfy and desirable. And one more thing: why in Nolans movies has there always to be this weird 007 James Bond feeling? It's annoying!"
284," Not a good movie
","Intentionally confusing, cliche, unnecessary scenes and many absurd plot holes. Fight and battle scenes look cheap and amateurish; but reminded me of dancing choreography, which is a nice touch I have to admit. But I was shocked by the poor audio quality of the movie as often the dialogue was barely understandable. Also, throughout the movie one gets constantly Nolan's Batman and artificial James Bond feeling; so nothing is really new. Nolan's weakest creation by far. So I was pretty disappointed."
285," Solid Action Film.
",Solid Action Film. Overly complicated plot. Good action sequence. Obvious plot holes. Characters just show up magically inside Soviet Union. Chased by single inept patrol car?? Ground army with no air support. Expect a fun ride not logic. Sorry Black Messia will beat Mr. Nolan's film for all the awards. It deserves recognition.
286," Huh? What a waste of money and time.
","After sitting through the plodding, convoluted, incomprehensible plot of Tenet, the only thing I got from this is why Warner Bros. Pictures is still handing over fat bank rolls to Christopher Nolan.No emotional depth, no logic to when an object or person starts going inverted and why other times they don't. It's like #Inception, only you can't follow the story at all and don't really care when it's over. Both are filled with his trademark handicap of stilted, overstuffed exposition, but at least Inception had some thrilling set pieces and was a story you could follow. Tenet's exposition made no sense and the visual example of the movie rules only further muddled the audience's understanding of the subject matter.The ""this guy is fighting backwards"" and ""these bullets are returning to the gun"" gets real old real fast. It's a flash in the pan idea that holds no weight or lasting resonance.Kudos to the actors who did as good of a job as they could given the material. Maybe if the movie didn't have such a bloated running time, it may have been more enjoyable... at least I wouldn't have felt like so much time was wasted."
287," Very original idea, bad sound
","Fact: the idea of the movie is complex. I can't say that I understood it well, so I will definitely need to watch it once more and then discuss it with people. But it is a very original idea about time that no other movie ever used before. All the previous movies about time travel was taking the time one directional, even when they travelled back in time.This one takes a different approach which suddenly opens up a lot of complicated possibilities. Reading other reviews, it is rather sad that people get angry or disappointed when they can't understand a physics concept, instead of trying to understand. When did viewers become so lazy, just wanting to watch something simple where they don't need to use much of their brains?
Spending so much time and energy on the brilliant idea and nice visuals, the movie falls behind on characters. They are not deep enough and so are the dialogues that is not about the main idea of the movie. Again, the main idea is so strong that, the rest can maybe be forgiven.But one thing that can't be forgiven is the terrible terrible sound mix. Whoever did the mastering really failed badly. Coversations are inaudable, sound effects are too loud, even when there is a conversation.All in all, the original idea saves the movie and places it among the top Si-Fi movies of the last years."
288," Breh! This movie is amazing.
",This movie challenges the audience next level. It is confusing but it is easy to follow the story. Easily one of his most genius films. Idk why ppl are complaining abt it being too confusing cos christopher nolan is known for making confusing movies and this one was his most ambitious project. The movie is incredibly smart. As film lovers we should appreciate directors who like challenging viewers.
289," Amazing, don't listen to the haters
",All the people rating it really low haven't even watched the film - don't listen to them - they're marvel idiots that hate Nolan
290," Just amazing!
","I don't know why people think you can't understand what the actors are saying. I can almost fully comprehend just like other movies. I think its the reverse sequences where everything is reversed including what they say, which nobody can understand.
Rest all is just amazing, like the sequences where some are going forwards and others backwards through time, they are perfectly synchronized. There seems to be no flaw, in all these sequences. They plot is heavy and I will need perhaps two more watches to fully understand."
291," Amazing
","I don't get the hate, I can understand it's hard to follow, but the plot, sound and visuals are freaking amazing. U realise ure warching a Nolan film from the very beginning and the actors are perfectly chosen, really liked it"
292," Thanks, I have a good sleep in theatre
","Overrated movie cause of it's unique system of traveling to past.Everyone getting out of hand saying its the theatre saviour.Music and bass way too loud and same tone which keep u intense throughout whole boring fighting scene that get u tiring.
What is the main purpose when the cinema was create?Is to enjoy the art of the movie, not to freak out my brain to put every broken piece together. Most of the thing done not convincing due to the actor personality. First 1 hrs still OK, and start to become dragging along the way.
Most of the story plot got flaws and yet most of the film critic try to cover the flaws and make many kind of explanation. I feel is the director fault if u can't make audience to understand in a 2hr 30 min movie and still had to waste money to see again to understand how the system works. My head hurts after half way through so decided to take a nap hoping this is a dream overlap dream."
293," Utter nonsense
","I am an ardent fan of Christopher Nolan but frankly speaking this movie is pathetic. Looks like the sole aim was to confuse the audience than write a great script. If you look at movies like inception the confusion in screenplay was worth the story unlike in Tenet. Where is the exact logical explanation (not in real world) in the movie on how things are happening? Dunkirk has been a disappointment for Nolan fans but Tenet is a huge dent. Sorry, Mr. NOLAN we are disappointed with your attempy to confuse us rather than to be a great story teller as what you used to be."
294," One star off for emotional unevenness
","This was an incredible experience! The sound design and music in my showing was phenomenal so I'm not sure what other people experienced but they must have fixed it. This was action-packed, brilliantly paced from the get-go, and filled with plenty of ""A-ha!"" moments that felt both surprising and inevitable. I'm docking one star off because at times it felt a little emotionally uneven and I found myself wanting slightly higher emotional stakes besides the thrill of the action. A re-watch would probably be a 10/10 experience (no spoilers but it's one of those films that probably hits different once you know the ending) but as it stands I was left wanting a little more heart. Don't go into this expecting to understand everything at once. Go with the flow! Be mindful of the details and tuck them away for delayed gratification later on."
295," Nice idea, badly executed
","I am not sure why there was such hype around this movie.. The idea was interesting, the acting above average the action scenes decent but the plotline was a total mess and failed miserably to capture the audience interest. Disconnected, meaningless dialogues, flat characters, irrelevant plot loops (SPOILER: not sure why the whole story with villains' wife and the .. ' fake painting' even existed), and a ton of plot holes and mistakes (SPOILER: travelling to past supposedly required wearing a mask with special breathable air but in half the scenes it was completely forgotten -appears characters build stronger lungs- or there was zero explanation where the air was coming from, just some tubes hanging from the mask to well... somewhere). No matter how hard I try to convince myself to like this movie, I just cant."
296," You'll enjoy, be confused or simply hate it
","I enjoyed the film for its ability to make you think. Honestly this isn't for the casual viewer. I enjoy Nolan's flim in that way that all that you see is never what it is. This film for me really took cinematography and capture to the next level. The rawness and realistic visuals were unmatched to anything I've seen to date. Watching I just thought, how much meticulous work it must have taken from inception (lol pun intended) to execution to make it all happen in reverse order. 2. The paradox of future vs past and time being non-linear.
The one down side was the dialogue was sometimes hard to hear. I'll admit I enjoyed the action and the story line but parts where an explanation of what was happening or going to happen was explained in very turbulent settings. So you kind of had to assume what was going on or just ignore parts of the story and just sit back and enjoy the visuals and action. The cast was amazing as well! Happy to see Mr. Washington lead at the fore front of the story and not as a supporting role. But I did keep thinking about his character in Ballers and also some facial expressions and mannerisms he's definitely picked up from his pops! All in all, I'll definitely see it again either in the theater or at home (with subtitles). :)"
297," Best mind bending of the decade
","I think I don't need to do talk about nolan's screenplay,but I need to,this movie crossed my expectations,I'm the one who understands memento just by watching it once but this movie makes me to watch twice to watch this in theatre,
Especially this movie wants you to work with your mind.
Comming to cast everyone did their best,and Ludwig Göransson filled the space of hans Zimmer precisely.
Finally thank you Nolan for giving us best experience."
298," Rubbish soundtrack
","This is a complex plot, with dialogue that needs hearing. Unfortunately the dialogue is obscured by a loud array of complex, irrelevant noise. Maybe better with the sound off and subtitles."
299," How disappointing...
","Almost from the beginning you realise that something went badly wrong in the production of this movie. The script was bad. The sound was terrible. The dialogue illegible. The editing was diabolical. As the movie develops you realise that you don't care about any of the characters. By halfway, you wish you were watching another movie. By the end, you are sad that nobody had the guts to tell Mr Nolan that he was filming a 'turkey'. What a Shame. All that effort for such a poor result."
300," This movie is a stupid person's idea of what an intelligent movie must be
","Nolan should have perhaps paid someone to make him understand what the meaning of entropy is. We are supposed to leave our brains at home when watching sci-fi. I get that. But this guy proceeds to insert an extremely convoluted plot with his idiotic idea of a very simple physics concept. I know that there are some sheep who will love this movie precisely because they don't understand it. Believe me, if you actually understand it, you'll hate the premise and the movie."
301," Mind-blowing
","This film is really mind-blowing. The plot has a lot of twists and unpredictable moments, also it has a lot of science but it is easy to understand because you have good explanation of it. Secondly, the cast is good, Robert Pattinson breaks all stereotypes about him, and Kennet Brana is awesome as main villain. Thirdly, I like all action and special effects, it's amazing.
So, it's great Nolan's film."
302," A Masterpiece.
","If you like Nolan's movies, this one is definitely one of his best.The plot was peculiar but great. If you really want to understand it, you are probably best to watch it again.After watching the movie, I felt confused but happy. I'm probably better off watching it again, to fully understand it.If you are thinking about watching the movie, go for it!Only problems I had was the audio. It was too loud for my taste, might be because I was sitting quite close to the speakers, but I would advise picking seats at the cinema carefully."
303," outstanding
",Sir Nolan always gave us extraordinary story and direction in their movies. salute you sir for entertainment.
304," Mind Blowing Movie
",This is a must watch movie in IMAX to really take in all the work and professional stunts that went into this movie. The cast in the movie was absolutely perfect and really made you get behind them. All the action scenes really keep you in the edge of you seat and wanting more. The storyline behind it all is it's to follow and understand unless you are paying really close attention to. None the less go watch this movie in IMAX!!! 95/100
305," Not my cup of tea.Waste of 2,5 hours
","This is not a movie for people with both feet on the ground. Irritating fight loops, stupid dialogues, mumbling actors, unrealistic content,....
People tell me to see this movie two or three times. Maybe, but I cannot find the time to see that over again. I need to watch it backwards. Do I receive my (lost) time back?
Not worth to watch. Sorry"
306," When you glue together a movie with no story.
","This movie is basically a mishmash between The matrix, Terminator and Storm Troopers but with no story or explanation as to how or why.If that weren't bad enough you have some basic low budget movie mistakes like no head rest on a car seat when the main character jumps into the car. I mean seriously 2020?This is a basic cash grab for special effects but it´s not a transformers movie.. This could have been a new cool franchise as the clearly made it out to be in the movie itself but it just sucks!You have to watch it more than once as most have said here but seriously why would you want to?"
307," Don't expect inception , because tenet has its own world
","Please ignore all the bad reviews and just watch it.
Don't judge the movie by it's first half because first half was little slow but second half will blow your mind.
We can say tenet is the mixture of all other works from Christopher nolan."
308," The Ambitions of Christopher Nolan is amazing
","They say in while in making movies, music and writing, that you have to know the rules to break them. Nolan takes this a step further with the laws of physics in this movie. And he breaks them in a respectful way in awesome manners.
i understand that this movie is hard to follow at times. As kind of a nerd i understood before watching this movie what entropy is and how it affects time. and that felt like a big help. still i feel like it there are so many pieces to put together, and i cant wait to see it again to put them together.
The Cinematics are magical and so innovative i gasped. Fight scenes and car chases where the subjects go different ways in time. Battle scenes where one squad fights the fight forwards and one squad fights backwards in time.
Chris Nolan! this is Amazing, especially for me, a film-student who loves physics!"
309," the greatest movie in this year
","Tenet is a film that will stay with you forever from its first scene, one that will tempt you to revisit it in part or as a whole, and that really tells you what it is: a masterpiece."
310," Short review: amazingly complex, but worth it!
","Go see this, Nolans new masterpiece is a real brainpuzzle. I was told to pay very good attention to ever detail and so I did. I think I got it. But if you don't pay attention, you won't. Then go watch it again. :)"
311," Another masterpiece
","Another Christopher nolan's masterpiece, such a great movie by that genius. 10/10"
312," Inception^2
","I'd like to focus on the main criticism of this movie: the complexity.With movies like this you shouldn't be afraid to not understand something at first, because it'll all become more clear later on. That's also why, for example, the music intentionally gets reletively loud sometimes - it's to show that it's not important to follow everything that's being said at some segment. Nolan uses tricks like these all the time throughout the movie, but you do need to be able to use them to your advantage to enjoy the movie.Sometimes you'd forget that we live in a three-dimensional world, and that it's just not our nature to comprehence the 4th time dimension. This movie does a fenominal job at visualizing this dimension, just like inception did at explaining dreams in dreams in dreams..., also known as inception.I only watched the movie once, and will again. That's the power of this movie."
313," Not bad
","This movie full fill the expectations,
This is not a master piece of Christopher Nolan,
This movie awesome but something missing, I am a biggest fan of Christopher Nolan"
314," Extraordinary, cinematography and music outstanding
","Prepare for a cinematic experience, pay attention to every detail and submerge yourself in this epic masterpiece. Probably the best Robert Pattinson performance and at last you get to see Kenneth Branagh fit the role perfectly. I've had to watch it twice, I enjoyed it first time around but simply blown away the second. Music is outstanding. You go go from 0 - 60 mph within seconds and it does not stop until the end credits. Cinema is back and thank god for Christopher Nolan"
315," Couldn't understand a single word said
","I regret not watching this subtitled as I have no idea what happened in this film.
It's confusing enough as it is, but when you can't understand what anyone is saying it's impossible. I advise everyone to watch this subtitled. I'm sure the film is good but it's a shame I couldn't hear any of the dialogue, the audio needs fixing"
316," Crapola
",Great opening scene. Great photography and effects. Terrible plot.Bad Continuity. Preposterous through and through and inhibited by bad acting. Yes Superfly and Dracula cant save this.
317," Visually fascinating but inaudible
",Other reviewers weren't kidding when they said you can't understand the dialogue. How does this movie get released? When the plot is complicated you MUST be able to hear the lines. Nolan is a moron
318," Long , confusing , lifeless
",Tenet was a film only the writer could understand I'm sure it played out well in Nolan's head but on the big screen was a mess . The music and sound effects far too loud . Didn't care for any of the characters? What was the plot ?. If you're a casual movie goer . Definitely do not watch this .
319," I love Nolan but I hate to say that there is too much you can try to accomplish in one movie.
","Let me start by saying that all the cast and crew including Nolan, worked very hard and did great work on making a movie. Take any scene by itself, and it is acted, directed, and overall, made very well.With that being said this movie was trying to be confusing. There were interesting sequences, and twists, but it was all too much.Apparently actors weren't allowed to read the script outside of a locked supervised area. Michael Caine, who has worked with Christopher Nolan on most of his movies, was only given his section of the script.I understand the need for secrecy for big budget movies, but some of the actors in the film didn't even know what the movie was about. When you have a movie written this complicated, it's almost as if he's trying to make it that way intentionally. I think that took away from the experience for me.It's not that I didn't understand it, and will probably notice more if I watch it again. It was well directed and had some great visual and action sequences, but I simply didn't enjoy this movie.I mean in the end, after all the hard work it takes to make a great movie, isn't the intention for the viewer to enjoy the experience? I know some movies are made to be the exception to that rule, but good movies, that aren't a fun experience, are made that way intentionally, like Requiem for a Dream. This was just complicated for the sake of being complicated, and the intense visuals and action didn't make up for that.Take 1917 for example, it was edited to make it look like one long take (with a minor exception) but that enhanced the experience.Inception was the last attempt from Nolan to make a complicated, multi-layered story. Now that people have dissected that to death, there are questions that only Nolan knows the answer to, and he made it that way. Nolan follows the code of Christian Bale's character from The Prestige. ""Don't give away the secret or it won't be special anymore"" ...I'm paraphrasing but you get the point.The big argument here that people who loved the movie will say is, ""you didn't understand it."" That's not always the case, and I hate that argument because not all complicated, or twisted movies are good.We all know that Christopher Nolan can make a good movie that's not overly complicated. Most of us know Nolan brings his A game when it comes to making movies (with maybe one exception). So why this twisted knot of a story? Inception, after repeat viewings is full of Easter eggs, and a lot of attention to detail was put in to making it, not just Nolan pulling a fast one (which he never does anyway). However there are a lot of times the movie breaks it's own rules.Christopher Nolan is a genius filmmaker, and a great writer, but he's human, and fallible. It just seems like when he's directing something he's written, he uses complex plot and secrecy to cover for any short comings.If you enjoyed the film, great! I did not. I won't even go as far as saying this was a bad movie. I just didn't enjoy watching it. Interstellar was brilliantly made as well and I didn't enjoy that either, there were, again, sequences I enjoyed but didn't like it as a whole.I'd just love to see Christopher Nolan make a movie without relying on an overly complex plot (with the exception of Dunkirk, or movies based on real events)Also, Memento didn't have an overly complex plot. It was just edited cleverly, and some key details are left ambiguous (much like any Nolan movie), however if you pay close enough attention, you can guess what Leonard's real backstory is.I know I'm probably the odd man out here, and I'm truly glad if you enjoyed the movie. For me this one wasn't enjoyable enough to make me want to dissect it like his other puzzle box movies."
320," Wow.
",Give this movie a chance and then give it a second chance to really soak it in! So many layers to this film makes it incredibly entertaining to witness the insane action and storytelling that's happening. Storytelling is gripping and complex. The acting is amazing all across the board and Nolan is on another level when it comes to directing and as usual he does not disappoint!
321," Terrible movie with a terrible plot
","Worst movie I've seen in a while. No character building, no introduction to anything, just a lot of plot holes from an over complex theory which no one knows anything about - time travel. Loads of really pointless action scenes. Tried to bring back USA vs Russia stereotypes."
322," A run against time
","Tenet is a very powerful film. Not the best of the best by Nolan, but still, rises above his commonly high quality.
Plot speaking, we witness the usual time paradoxal complexity highened to ambitious levels: we see everything happen at the same time; past, future, entangled together. Some would say it lacks soul and afection for the characters (Nolan has already proved his talent in sentimental scripts). However, my interpretation is that it all comes together as a goal to show us what Robert Pattinson's Neil claims: the whole story is a conspiration, moving through the shadows of ignorance of everybody.
The film is quite brilliant in every other aspect. It intercuts classic spy scenes with breathtaking action sequences, directed with such intensity the movie passes by like it was merely a few minutes long. A special praise for both the prologue and the final sequence: an almost insane run against time, remembering war scenarios.
It is a movie one must see more than once, due to its complexity but also richness and detail. But, it is a Nolan project, so, everyone knows it is really worth our time."
323," SUPERB , Stupendous 💥💥💥 . Having Said That ..I'd Hoped for MORE from my hero CHRIS NOLAN 🌠 ; or perhaps.. "" LESS❓❗"" ...now I'm not quite sure... { ~ WHICH 😶😶😶 ~ } .
","______________________________________________________The Protagonist : "" This reversing { of } the flow of time, does us being here now, mean it { - Never - }... happened ? "" .
Plunging "" Headfirst 🎯 "" into the Action from the very ~{ GET GO }~ , Tenet is in ~{ No Way }~ lacking in that proverbial, age old, & ever cherished ""thrills-and-spills"" Department. The actors ( R-Patz, Elizabeth Debicki, Kenneth Branagh, Dimple Kapadia ) were all 'generally' well cast, with the choice of John David Washington 🌠 in the Lead-Role as ' The { Fresh-faced, new } Protagonist ', resonating in a very Obvious & Powerful { 🔥 } way, in this era of ' Hashtag-B.l.m ' ( etc. )... whether that was by design, or whether it wasn't .
Having-Said-That : The dialogue in that thoroughly action-""Drenched"" first scene of the film, which I just jubilantly hinted at above, is also for the Most Part, quite unfortunately, ... "" Almost - Entirely - Unintelligible "" ..I'm Afraid . { Nb } : This is in part due to the fact that most ( if not all ) the primary characters in that scene are -actually- wearing Swat Style gas masks during their performances for pretty much what turned out to be almost the -Entire- scene { ..filmed at the -Fittingly- beautiful and atmospheric Estonia Concert Hall in Linnahall, Tallinn } .
This aspect of the production { namely : the "" Profound "" inability to comprehend ( ~ A Lot ~ ) of what is being said by nearly ( ~ All ~ ) of the Lead-characters in the picture at Many, Many, Many, Many, Many points in the film }, is what eventually turns out to be its unequivocal, & 'enduring' .....( Even )..... Achille's Heel. Please be aware that I -{ Do Not }- say this 'lightly'. And this is Totally-Because of the fact that this particular cinematic presentation is ~{ Wholly }~ reliant on a very way-out-there, er "" supremely science-{ Fantastical 🔴 } "" ...( and as yet ~ Non Existent ~ )... concept of theoretical physics called ~ Temporal Inversion 💥💥💥💥 ⏳ ~ { this basically means : the ' Reversing ' ...of what would be considered certain ~otherwise quite ordinary~ ( "" Space / Some Very Specific Related Physical Objects / Time "" ) events... and what have you } .
Therefore, this very unique 'Special-Feature' of Tenet makes the need to understand, very literally ~{ every single word }~ of dialogue in the movie extremely well.... of paramount importance. Sadly, that was anything ~{ But }~ the case. So, in a nutshell, my son loved it, while my wife -A Nurse- already exhausted from having worked a solid 9 hour Afternoon-shift prior to our having watched the film }, simply said she "" couldn't understand it , at all "" ....{ Outright }. As for me ....well , you may well -{ Yet }- get a ""very different"" sounding review from me, as a 'Profound-Update' to this one, once I ( eventually ) have the 'utter-Luxury' of watching it a couple of times, with the ~{ Subtitles }~ on, for a change .....once it comes out on Dvd / Amazon / Netflix ( etc. ) .
Summary , 8.25 Marks Out Of 10 : 👉{ BREATHTAKINGLY } Beautiful shots and Vistas ; { The picture was shot in, get this ( 💯 🔥❗)..... 1Talinn- Estonia, 2Mumbai- India, 3Rødbyhavn- Denmark, 4Oslo-Norway, 5Victorville- California, 6Southampton- U.k, 7Los Angeles- California, 8London- U.k, 9Riverside County- California, & finally.. 10~Several~ locations all across Italy, culminating on its stunning & ~( Exotic )~ you guessed it ...Amalfi Coast } .

324," Awful
","Has Christopher Nolan lost it? This is the first Nolan film I actually dislike and im usually a big fan of his. Inception is one of my fav films of all time so I went into this thinking I would at least enjoy elements of it. I didn't. The concept is no where near as enticing as Inception and the execution was very poor.It had no redeeming features either as apart from Pattinson (who was quite good) the performances lacked conviction, the action was very dull and all the plot was told during lengthy dialogue sequences where the characters explain everything to each other. Music sounded like a parody of itself and the world in which all this takes place was dull and lacked a sense of place. Nothing felt real.It felt like Nolan really wanted to make a James Bond film and threw in the backwards bullets to give a sci-fi twist. Unfortunately he does not seem to know what makes Bond work and all we get is his lifeless characters and environments mixed with a science lecture. I'm not surprised he hasn't been given an actual Bond film of his own to make if this is what he pitched."

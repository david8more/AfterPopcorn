0," Dunkirk review
","Brilliant cinematography, real planes flying, real destruction of planes, the most real as possible, that's always great for films and it's one of Nolan's best quality as a director, he want real things happening on camera,
and of course Hans Zimmer original score is also brilliant.The non-linear narrative is intelligent, the mole sequences fell longer, in a good way, because the characters spend 1 week there, the sea sequences are a little bit more faster because the characters spend 1 day there and the air sequences are even faster because the characters spend 1hour there, when the 3 got together is the climax, or at least should be, that's is when the non-linear storytelling gets a little messy, some of the sequences in the third act are not puted in the best way, but the whole movie is so extremely well made in his technical stand points, written full of suspense and with an amazing original score by Hans Zimmer, that a lot people's don't realize that or they just don't care.The most negative point like i said is that some scenes don't fit very well in the non-linear agitation of the film, especially in the last half hour, and for a non-linear movie this is bad, but like i said, with all the qualities that this films has, this is not going to ruin the experience to watch.This film is also not made to be most remembered about the acting, which is not necessarily a bad thing, some peoples also says that the characters are kinda weak, which is not actually true, sure they are not as strong like the characters in Saving Private Ryan for example, but they are strong, the film just don't focus too much on them, the film is most interested on what happened in Dunkirk during that particular time in World War II. All that said, Mark Rylance is really good in this movie, he has the best lines and Cillian Murphy is also very good."
1," A short review with a longer explanation of why its OK that this movie didn't have any ""characters""
","Dunkirk is, in my opinion, yet another masterpiece from mastermind Christopher Nolan. Since everything that is brilliant about the film has already been said I will briefly write what I think of the film and also touch on a topic that some people are criticizing the movie for.The fantastically directed film is told from 3 perspectives non chronologically. It superbly tackles the narrative and the non linear story doesn't at all pull you away from the intensity of the events happening on screen that don't stop from 00:00 to the last scene. Hans Zimmer most likely gives one of the most fitting scores for a war film ever. Sometimes there is only one note playing followed by heartbeat sounds and a ticking clock while other times a massive orchestra is interpreting what is going on on screen. The movie brilliantly projects the feeling of each and every soldier on the beach to the audience. Confusion, turmoil and fear. The cinematography was breathtaking and I felt anxious throughout most of the run time. There is no lead in this film and I can't really say anyone stuck out as giving a brilliant performance because it wasn't needed and I'll explain why.The biggest criticisms of Dunkirk that I've heard of so far are that the characters are lacking in depth and that we aren't given anything to be invested in them. I feel like Nolan was trying (successfully) to make the audience care for each and every one of the men on the beach. He needed to have some form of ""main characters"" to be in the story so that we can see the events unfold from the direct perspective of all of the soldiers. Usually in war films (I'll use saving private Ryan as an example) the plot revolves around certain soldiers (like Cpt. Miller and Ryan) being in a war and doing things in the war but its still about THEM not THE WAR as much. In my opinion Dunkirk is a telling the STORY OF DUNKIRK. Not of Harry Style's character or Tom Hardy's character but of Dunkirk. What any of the ""main characters"" felt, every other soldier felt. Nolan resorted more to film-making techniques to tell the story rather than dialogue and that is why some people might have had a problem with the lack of character depth but realistically this type of terrible event wouldn't be a place for someone to ""develop"" as a character but rather a event where MEN WANTED ONLY SURVIVAL, and Nolan showed that perfectly. As for what the top review of Dunkirk on IMDb says about 'lack of emotion' in the film, I believe this to be a completely incorrect statement. Maybe he was referring to the lack of 'brotherhood amongst men' or the feeling of moral or something epic like that. Again the longing for the 'Saving Private Ryan' format of war films. What the reviewer fails to see is that realistically there was NO emotion on that beach besides fear and confusion. And I can safely say that Nolan and Zimmer and the DP all successfully gave us those feelings.9.5/10"
2," A technical masterpiece that is nearly devoid of palpable emotion and compelling characters.
","Might as well get right to it, then. At the risk of sounding like a contrarian, I did not love this film. Do I love elements of this? Yes. Is this a 5-star masterpiece? Unfortunately, no. The cinematography here at least, is masterful. Director Christopher Nolan has, without a doubt, reached the pinnacle of on-screen spectacle here. The feats of practical effects in this film are breathtaking. The casting of nearly 6,000 extras, authentic WWII vehicles, and shooting on location in Dunkirk, France contribute to a great sense of scale here. There is ongoing trend of action films in recent years of relying on CGI, and thankfully Nolan bucks that trend. Similar to War for the Planet of the Apes, much of the film plays out without much dialogue, leaning on just the score and sound design in most scenes. It almost goes without saying that Hans Zimmer delivers with another incredible score. The sound design is also extremely well crafted, which, paired with Nolan's great work behind the camera, truly transports you to the Battle of Dunkirk. The wailing of planes passing above, the drone of gunfire, and the roar of explosions all contribute to the complete immersion into the world these characters are trapped in. This results in some of the most immersive wartime action scenes since Saving Private Ryan.This film has and will continue to be compared to World War II classic Saving Private Ryan. Both films are beautifully filmed WWII period pieces with casts that deliver great performances. The similarities end there. Whereas Saving Private Ryan was engrossing as a narrative due to it's characters with depth and arcs, Dunkirk instead leans on it's subject matter and spectacle.And while the subject matter of Dunkirk is fascinating, as a film it lacks emotional firepower due to the absence of a strongly written protagonist. This is strangely uncharacteristic of a director of Nolan's caliber, especially when you recall the complex character work in his most acclaimed films: The Dark Knight, Memento, and The Prestige. Instead of focusing on a single character or single group of characters, the focus is spread across three protagonists in completely different situations. Showing the Dunkirk Evacuation through the three different perspectives of those on the beach, the sea, and the air is only an interesting proposition on paper. The narrative, due to this writing choice, is spread far too thin, with few characters getting enough screen time to develop even the mildest emotional connection.While the characters in this film aren't written to even remotely be compelling, the great work from this cast is not to be overlooked. Harry Styles, known for being a member of English boy band One Direction, is surprisingly excellent here in his acting debut. Mark Rylance, Kenneth Branagh, and Fionn Whitehead also all give standout performances despite the limited screen time they are given. I should love this film. Historical drama? WWII setting? My favorite director Christopher Nolan? Amazing cinematography? Superb performances from an ensemble cast? All of these elements made me sure I would love this going in. But, Dunkirk's lack of emotional connection severely detracts from the awe-inspiring scope and technical prowess displayed. If I reviewed based on visuals alone, this is a slam-dunk, walk-off home run of a 5-star film. While a focus on grandeur and situation over character depth and emotion may work for some (it obviously worked for 98% of critics on Rotten Tomatoes), it did not work for this critic.This is without a doubt a cinematic achievement, but without an emotional core, it's impossible for this film not to feel cold and empty. Despite being a technical masterpiece, this is Christopher Nolan's most disappointing film yet."
3," Did I see a different movie than everyone else that has raved about how good it is?
","I was very disappointed with this movie. I have liked previous Nolan movies but this one left me feeling cheated that I had spent that much money to see it. It was boring and unrealistic.One scene had a ship getting hit with a bomb and immediately rolling on it's side then remaining afloat.At the end a plane runs out of fuel and seemingly defies the laws of physics by gliding forever and ever shooting down a plane before landing on the beach. They kept showing shots of the beach with lines of soldiers that nowhere approximated over 400,000 soldiers. Same with the amount of ships and boats and planes. The hype of this being one of the best war movies ever had me expecting something special. Instead it had me sitting there wondering when the fantastic movie was going to start. I waited in vain. Instead I left the show with a headache from the noise bombardment from the soundtrack.My biggest sense of wonder was that they had spent that much money making it. I wanted to like this movie but it never happened for me."
4," Put Down the Kool-Aid
","Given the outright gushing of critics in praising this film, I was quite surprised to discover Dunkirk to be not only not deserving of such praise, but even worse, to be a cacophony of minimalist nonsense, topped off by one of the most ridiculous film climaxes in recent memory (more on that later). ""Possibly the best war film of all time?"" Not quite, I could name dozens better. In fact I struggle to think of many that are worse than this. My goodness, where to begin...First I do not understand where the $150 million budget was spent. The actual story of the Dunkirk evacuation involved - literally - hundreds of thousands of men, and hundreds of boats and planes. In this film, we see....a few hundred men? 30 boats? Something like six planes? Where is the grand scale that a story like Dunkirk deserves, or really, demands? There was no grand scale. That is a heinous omission and oversight and ultimately fails to tell the story of Dunkirk as it should be told. And if you don't want to use CGI to achieve that scale, that's fine, but then either expand the real numbers of extras and props so it replicates what Dunkirk was actually like, or, don't do the film. A few soldiers standing around on the beach looks incredibly silly when the characters say on more than one occasion that there are over 300,000 men there. Where are they? We never saw them. Ludicrous.Similarly, we see a few boats here and there, and a few planes. This does not come close to approximating the flotilla of ships, boats and other watercraft used - in reality over 800. It's hard to appreciate what a tremendous achievement the Dunkirk evacuation was - ultimately, the aim of this film I suspect - when we never actually see that achievement occur. We see a few boats and few planes. Literally a drop in the bucket of what Dunkirk was. Yet at the conclusion, as the men are disembarking, back safe in England, we are supposed to be swept up in a swelling feeling of appreciation for something that we never actually witness. Very bizarre.The soundtrack, if you can call it that, was an escalating collection of random and intrusive blaring instruments that can be best described as 'noise.' I have no idea what the goal was there. Perhaps it was an attempt to convey what one might feel, the intense experience one might have, if he or she was in a war-time situation like this. Perhaps. A professional critic called it 'bombastic' and that's probably being generous. I am not lying when I tell you I had to take an Advil when I got back from the theater, thanks to the crazily escalating noise that overwhelms the latter part of the film. Yikes.As for the climax, the scene of a Spitfire seemingly free of the laws of physics and gravity is bereft of all logic, and was such an eye-rolling piece of nonsense, no amount of criticism on my part can do it justice. Let's just say planes cannot keep flying indefinitely, much less maneuver and successfully engage other aircraft, when that plane has run out of fuel. The film deserves to be panned for this ridiculous scene alone.This is not a great war film, it's not even a good war film. It is not typical or traditional story-telling, I will give it that. There are stretches of this film that lack dialogue and there is zero character development. While different, that's hardly unique (it's been done before). Perhaps some critics haven't understood that 'different' does not automatically translate to 'good' or 'great' - sometimes, it does not.Put down the Kool-Aid. As my brother said to me when we walked out of the theater last night, ""Assuming I would like this, I thought I would go see this again over the weekend. Not only am I not doing that now, I won't even bother watching this once it's on cable or Netflix."" True that, bro. 5/10."
5," A truly boring and tedious movie.
","As a regular movie goer I was naturally looking forward to seeing what all the hype was about in regards to ""Dunkirk"". Well I was sorely disappointed, and came away frustrated at what the director could have done with such a large budget, instead of the tedious film he gave us. Within the first 10 minutes we find ourselves on the beach, together with lines and lines of soldiers facing the water, waiting for the boats to collect them. Never mind the fact, that the boats had not even left England yet! Needless to say, the soldiers were completely unprotected in the open, and made for great target practice for the German planes above them. I found the lack of character building to be an enormous let down. Whilst there were three mini plots, the soldiers being evacuated, the trio of Spitfires, and the one small boat with the man and his son, there was little or no interaction between the actors in these mini plots. I call them actors as we were never able to get to know them by name as such, and hence there were no characters in this movie per se. Kenneth Branagh spent the entire moving walking up and down the wharf trying to get the soldiers into whatever boats appeared. The supposed armada that was dispatched from the other side of the channel, never looked more than a bunch of mates out for an afternoon cruise.There were many scenes with little or no dialogue, which depicted what it was really like for mainly those on the beach, or in an unused trawler a group of them came across. Whilst these may have been realistic, we had no idea who the characters involved were, as we had no opportunity to engage with them throughout the film.There were many times when we switched from a night time scene to daytime one, and then back to night time, when supposedly all the action was taking place at the the same time. In my humble opinion, Dunkirk could have, and should have been an epic movie, but I'm afraid to say that I found it boring, tedious, and without character. I am well aware that I am in the minority with this opinion, but it really could have been so much better.Cheers,Hans"
6," Soul-less. Confused. Loud. Disappointing.
","Being an avid war film fan, I was beyond excited seeing the trailer for Dunkirk and couldn't wait until it hit theatres. To say I was disappointed is an understatement. By the end of the film, I was actually mad. I have to agree with some of the reviewers here who've stated that many of these glowing reviews are paid for, because what they're describing isn't even the same film.Before the artsy-fartsy daggers come out--no, I don't need tons of backstory to feel invested in the characters. It's war, it's brutal, and I can surmise what it must be like for these brave souls. But when I come out the film and can't remember a single character's name (or worse, even care about them), that's just crap storytelling. Art should inspire a connection. This left me devoid of anything to be honest.Scale...I may as well have been watching a tiny pocket of some soldiers, fighting some war, taking place somewhere. Part of what's so astonishing and inspiring about Dunkirk was its sheer scale. This insipid attempt to condense it to bite-sized POVs is insulting. You would expect at the end when the character (I literally can't remember his name) began reading Churchill's announcement to be roused by emotion. But since the film didn't generate any, and the delivery was so bland, it didn't even click with me what he was reading until I heard, ""We shall fight on the beaches."" Lastly, a film doesn't have to be linear so I don't mind differing time lines. This however, was like some art-house, ""look at how cool I play with time"" film school project. I'm sorry...GAWD I'm sorry... but this was bad. I think about 100+ reviews explained why it doesn't work.Storytelling has been used by our species for centuries to share POVs, be morality tales, entertain screaming kids who won't sleep...you get the picture. NONE of that happens if your audience doesn't connect with the story. This was an experiment and indulgence. A $150M indulgence and waste of viewers' time and money. Shame on you."
7," A visual wonder that lacks depth
","Christopher Nolan is a visual genius: this film is just stunning to look at. From the bullets flying near soldier's head to gorgeous explosions, it transports you right into the war zone within the first 10 minutes of the screening. Furthermore, it is an accurate description of the ""Miracle of Dunkirk"". This is where the movie nails it. However, apart from that, I've had a couple of issues with it.The film is told from three perspectives: Air, Mole and Sea. This is where the movie falls a bit short. The editing at some points feels lazy and not very consistent: it cuts from a dramatic scene or intense action scene very quickly. The film is told in a non-linear way: this makes us watch certain scenes twice through different perspectives. Although this could've been done in a very interesting way, it's very difficult to keep track of whose perspective we're watching at times. Even when certain semi-important (I'll get back to this later) soldiers die, it took me a while to realise this happened.This is where my third and final problem come into question: the characters lack depth. You don't care about the main character, nor any of the other soldiers that are dying. If I'm watching a film about war, I like to bond with the characters I'm seeing on screen. If none of them show any real emotion, the viewer won't as well.All in all, Dunkirk could've been amazing. I personally don't understand why it has such a high rating besides being directed by a very well-known director / starring famous actors (including infamous Harry Styles) / being a war biography. Disappointing."
8," In 2017, over 330.000 film viewers were stuck in a cinema, surrounded by boredom, can they be rescued?
","It's hard to understand critic ratings of 10/10 while this movie undeniably lacks quality on some very important aspects. Let me start off with some positive notes:IMAX: The impact of the bullets and bombs felt as if you were really there. The entire movie is shot in a very realistic way. Opening scene: The suspense, music and cinematography all came together very well in the opening scene, which really made me excited for the scenes to come.Acting: Poor acting can easily distract the audience from their experience of being in a certain time/place. But there was not a single moment in which an actor did something out of character. All expressions were very believable. Great acting!But there were some major aspects I had issues with:Characters: The characters did not have any background story and there's hardly any dialogue to give some insight. The main characters are therefore replaceable for any other random soldier on that beach. I do not expect an elaborate introduction of every character, certainly not in a historical war movie, but the downside is that the audience cannot empathize with the main characters. I really didn't care for one of them to die. I've seen hundreds of soldiers die in earlier scenes of the movie, why would one or two more (just as hollow and unknown as any other soldier) bother me a bit? It's no must to focus on character development, as long as the other aspects of the movie make up for the lack of it. In Dunkirk that sadly was not the case.Editing: Sometimes it was hard to follow which moment in time is shown, because the movie abruptly cuts between three perspectives, therefore even showing some events twice. I find this non-linear storytelling and continuity breaks unnecessary and poorly executed.Repetitive: Much scenes are identical or slightly different from another. Especially the flight scenes did not add much to the story. Instead I rather would've seen some scenes at the front-line with troops actually defending the beach instead of just a bunch of scared, helpless troops waiting for the next plane to fly over and bomb the shite out of them. Keeping out the Germans at the front-line is just as much a part of the story of Dunkirk and it would've given us a chance to actually see the enemy and get some awesome battle scenes. Music: Usually I enjoy Zimmer's score. But in this movie there was no moment of silence, not a moment to break the suspense. Especially in IMAX, my ears were buzzing hours after I left the cinema. Was this intentional? Was it supposed to feel like one big action scene without any breaks, to get the same feeling of those soldiers, trapped between battles unable to take a break, constantly in stress of a nearing attack? Well, than Nolan did succeed. But I found it very annoying. Overall I believe this movie is highly overrated, due to many biased Nolan fans and critics blindly hopping on the hype-train. I found it a very boring movie. The lack of an interesting plot or any interesting characters sadly wasn't compensated enough by the impressive audiovisuals. Rescue yourself from boredom and don't watch this movie!"
9," Drama War
",This film shows that Christopher Nolan does not only depend on crazy action or crazy plot twist. He shows 3 separate stories that come together and tells us a good story.
10," Hipsterish affectation of an ""artistic"" war movie.
","This movie is so paper thin I really can't write much about it. So many missed opportunities in a film about one of the most spectacular and complex battles of WWII. I can see what Nolan tried to do here, a kind of British ""Thin Red Line"" (there's even wind in the grass, lol, i kid you not), but he failed spectacularly. There are no memorable characters to be found here, and one wonders even if there are any actual characters at all. Not one, not one of them has any semblance of a character arc. Not one. Again, I see how Nolan tried to convey the impersonality of war and insignificance of the individual but he did it with such a heavy, clumsy hand, providing us with no counterpoint with which to drive the point home. It's basic screen writing stuff really. I'd expect such ineptitude from a first year film student but not from a supposed ""master of the craft"".But anyways, this could have been forgivable if the film was more about the event itself, but it fails at that too. After watching the film, you'd be given to believe that the Battle of Dunkirk was fought by three Spitfires (100 were lost over the beeches alone), 1 German heinkel, a couple of stukas, 2 destroyers or a dozen or so boats... Oh yes and maybe a few hundred men standing quietly on a beach, doing nothing except desperately trying to look morose and dejected in a faintly passive-aggressive way. It's ridiculous. We are talking about total and absolute chaos happening there, hundreds of thousands of rifles alone discarded on the beach, not to mention guns, artillery, trucks... Burning and sinking ships of all sizes all across the horizon, parts of beaches inaccessible from rotting corpses washing up with tides. This was actually way bigger than D-Day landings in terms of men and equipment stuffed in a very small patch of land. Half a million desperate men stuffed in a small town, bombarded incessantly and under constant attack from bombers. Where did all those people defecate, what did they eat ffs? I wanted to know that, really. That at least would have given some much needed humanity to the so-called-characters Nolan keeps yanking around like so much puppets. So many missed opportunities there...If Nolan wanted to do a tight little film about isolation and desperation of being on the loosing side of the war, he had plenty of other places and battles to choose from. Just ask around. Or if he simply had to insist on Dunkirk, then we should have seen this total chaos all around our protagonists, in the background at least - that would have served as a really powerful, so desperately needed counterpoint to the individual suffering and heroism.And this brings me to the final point. The movie is one tone only. A monotone repetition of sights and emotions we've seen and experienced before. No one cracks a joke. No one really breaks down. No one has an embarrassing moment. There are no ups and downs, it's just some morose faceless robots performing obvious actions leading towards a bleedingly obvious goal. One single emotional and narrative tone from the beginning to the end. The entire emotional and narrative content of the movie would have fit snugly into a 20 minute short, and that is pretty much how long it takes before you start yawning. The best thing that can be said about the movie is that individual scenes are well directed and worth experiencing. But that is the real problem here - the film is constructed as a series of impressive ""experiences"" rather than cohesive piece of drama (And this particular historical event is almost uniquely stuffed with dramatic opportunities. It's almost as if golden-age Hollywood writers wrote the script for the actual event.) In other words, it's a Dunkirk theme park rather than a movie. You take rides. And that's it. And even those become repetitive after a while."
11," Devastatingly Disappointed
","-Contains Spoilers-After reading such amazing universal critical praise, my less than stellar experience of watching Dunkirk obligated me to write my first ever review on IMDb. I am a big fan of Christopher Nolan, in many ways I think he has truly changed cinema and how we experience film. I would go as far as to call him a visionary artist. This is why Dunkirk truly baffled me.Let's think about the technical facts of the Dunkirk evacuation, it is said over and over in the film that there are 300,000 men on the beach. We see maybe 1,000. A mass evacuation this scale took hundreds and hundreds of vessels. We see upwards of 30-40. And the Luftwaffe was definitely assailing the beach, yet in the film we see a paltry 8 planes. There is something missing here, it's called ""scale"". This film has a complete dearth of it. And that is a shame and blaspheme to the experience of the true Dunkirk evacuation. Beyond the obvious factual incongruities, there are glaring narrative holes. We have no connection to these characters, they seem cold and distant from us. There is no character development whatsoever in the film. I understand that Nolan was trying to show the entire character of the Dunkirk evacuees, but again we only saw a minuscule few hundred of what was supposed to be 300,000 so this argument is moot to me. We don't even get to see one Nazis either, so the ""grand villain"" that was forcing the evacuation was never even on the screen!!!!The score and the sound design have been mentioned by many reviewers, and again I was so underwhelmed. There have been so many better films for both scores and sound design, too many to list actually. Yes, there is some stellar cinematographer, but we expect that from Mr. Nolan.Finally, I've heard and read ""One of the best war films ever"" so many times now. Give me a break. There are many many better war films- Ran, The Bridge on the River Kwai, Apocalypse Now, Full Metal Jacket, The Thin Red Line, and Saving Private Ryan to name just a few. I'd suggest you rent or buy one of these instead of watching Dunkirk. I wouldn't waste my time viewing this film again. I hope Nolan's next film is far better."
12," One of the most dishonestly over-rated films of all time. 1 of 10.
","Yes, awful. How can anyone honestly give this film a positive recommendation? It is so amateurish. Whoever wrote the screenplay forgot the story. What story is it! It's not about Dunkirk, the famous WWII evacuation of British troops from France. What about the French troops? The British commander says to hell with them. Two cowards are the focus of the story. They will do anything to get out ahead of everyone else who are patiently waiting, keeping order, and waiting their turn. One other is picked up by a civilian boat on its way to rescue troops at Dunkirk, and he fights the crew to not go back. He kills one of them. Great story? I figure they used 5 planes to make the entire film: three RAF fighters, one German fighter, and one German bomber, all classic planes. Why I say this is b/c they only show three RAF fighters in one scene, and then it's always a one-on-one with all the other scenes. The special effects are from the 1950's. I think they did a better job in Wings, 1927. Also, it's hard to figure out what they are saying. I missed half the dialogue, but I didn't miss much b/c it's so worthless a film. It's aimless, boring, pathetic, and cheap. There is nothing epic about this film. It's a sad joke. What a waste of my money. It's one of the most over-rated films of all time."
13," Does not live up to the critics reviews
","I have never bothered to post a review before for any film. But I feel that I must to point out the nonsense of film reviewers these days. I see the critics post as must see, film of the year, et, etc. This was billed as a film with fantastic sound. I found the continuous droning noise whose pitch increased during the film to what I hoped would be a fantastic climax, but I the drone included what sounded like whale noises and more boring droning noises with occasional sounds of gun fire. I was bored after 15 minutes, the ridiculous story of the kid in the fishing boat, the original bit about the spitfire pilots and the nonsense of the soldiers taking cover in the boat.....absolute shallow lazy boring rubbish filming. If they added a decent music score it may have kept me interested. This film does not show it as it was its just absolute cap and does not come across as a powerful film at all. A waste of money."
14," I was so looking forward to this for this movie........
","Been traveling and away but just managed to catch it on its last week here. I made it, so exited when me and my son sat down...... then. Major disappointment.How is it possible that it has been graded so high? So many mistakes that even my 14 year old son could find, History and Pilot nonsense etc.The good, in short. Actors did a good job, but that is about it. Then. Dunkirk was a major milestone during the second world war. The scale of it could not be seen in the movie. The soundtrack destroyed much of the overall feel and was annoying after awhile. Allot of noise to summarize it. The plot and suspense when soldiers were trapped in the fishing boat was ridiculous. I mean the boat was too heavy and one guy need to leave to make it float free, all while the boat was filled with more than 2 tons of water, really? And water kept coming in through bullet holes close to the water line but still with pressure that you could believe it was a submarine 20 meters below the surface. Then soldiers still manage to drown in the fishing boat. Allot of nonsense trying to get some nerve into the movie. This do not even belong in a B-movie, period. Then you have a pilot that can fly forever without the engine, even engage in enemy dogfight that he wins. He then do a flyby over the rescue flotilla (that could pick him up after ditching) but he choose to land on the beach to be captured by the Germans, what?The pilot stand next to his plane and Giant gantry cranes are visible in the background. No such cranes existed in the 40s. For a time i wonder if there were a twist there in the end, moving in time or so, but no, the cranes kept showing in the background and Germans show up. By then i was hoping to move in time, about two hours back or so. Why i kept asking me, make such a bad movie on such a piece of history?"
15," A Masterpiece (of Emotionless Boredom And Nolan Trickery)
","Crow the critics are about Nolan's latest, ""Dunkirk."" A stunning masterpiece say many. Masterpiece my ass.Snookered by the hype and war film fandom, ducats were placed on counter, a ticket for admission passed back. Lights dimmed, anticipation mounted, and... nothing. Nothing. Save lurching between disparate, battle set pieces featuring people for whom little or no empathy exists. Lacking investment in the characters, what remains are merely adequate, bloodless war scenes easily outgunned by the recent ""Fury"" and, farther back, ""Saving Private Ryan."" For example, a young boy is killed but we know nothing of him, nothing of his motivation for climbing aboard a civilian, Dunkirk-bound boat at the last minute. We feel nothing for him because he's simply a cardboard cutout.As the actors barely register emotion, boredom set in and not to be shaken off. The characters move as wind-up toys. There are few actors who bare their soul like Cillian Murphy, here a shell-shocked survivor. As directed, he sleepwalks with the depth of an amateur in a high school production. He's not alone. All the actors turn in measured performances with identical blank looks and monotone deliveries. Particularly wasted is the actor's actor, Kenneth Branagh.Certainly the bravery and sacrifice of civilian and military in the Dunkirk evacuation is celebrated in ""Dunkirk."" Thank you. However, this historical action occurred in 1940. Films echo the zeitgeist of the time in which they're produced. It's an odd choice to make a large (bad) film about an evacuation three-quarters of a century past. There's a stink of political agenda afoot in ""Dunkirk"" that's intolerable. The enemy, unseen in ""Dunkirk,"" lurks and kills from safety by air and ground. Surrounded with backs to the the Atlantic, the very survival of a way of life is in question, as portrayed in ""Dunkirk."" (Spoiler Alert: The Allies Won The War.) The enemy's attacks are isolated like terrorism. The result is ""Dunkirk"" weaves a cautionary allegory mirroring religious extremism bent on destroying all non-believers.Subtle propaganda is dangerous. ""Dunkirk"" fits that bill. Either that or Nolan is a complete idiot who hasn't a whit of sense. It's a toss-up based on a filmography including the lackluster borefest ""Interstellar,"" and the beyond inane ""Inception."" Nolan remains static in his career with ""Dunkirk."" His films are half-baked, underwritten, detached, and emotion-free. ""Dunkirk"" plays like a rough cut by a bad director who expects the viewer to emotionally fill-in-the-blanks. ""Dunkirk"" even lacks the courage of its convictions in being bloodless - there are no graphic deaths. At least Spielberg had the courage to rub the viewer's nose in the stench of death in ""Saving Private Ryan."" The first half hour of that film is unprecedented in the depiction of carnage (one can almost taste the grit of raining sand from nearby mortar strikes). Nolan sanitizes-for-your-own-protection. Yet he chose a violent topic and punked out; a war movie detached from death is not a film about war. By design, war cannot include gratuitous violence, just insanity - an element also lacking in ""Dunkirk.""The wall-to-wall dramatic, but mixed low, score loses its effectiveness and becomes annoying. And, the constant, ham-handed crosscutting between stories further waters this already thin soup by stopping a scene's dramatic momentum.A short scene in ""Mrs. Miniver"" (1942) featuring civilian Walter Pidgeon returning from Dunkirk in his shot up runabout says more in the visuals and a few lines of dialogue about the evacuation than the entirety of ""Dunkirk."" As Trump might Tweet, ""Sad!"""
16," What a disaster.. the movie that is...
","Ever since the end of the second world war, the phrase 'Dunkirk spirit' has been used in Britain to describe courage and solidarity in times of adversity. However, this film chooses to focus on a young soldier who tries every underhand trick he can think of to get on board the rescue vessels ahead of everyone else. Where's the bravery or self sacrifice in that? Instead of identifying with this ""hero"" I became increasingly angry with him and had nothing but contempt for his actions. Why not push in front of everyone else by pretending to be a medic? Why not pretend to be a survivor from a ship that's just been bombed and sunk? Not only do you get priority access to the next rescue boat but you get a hot drink, food and warmth before your comrades left behind on the beach. I was actually happy that every escape attempt failed for this character.It wouldn't be so bad if there was some dialogue to help us identify with Tommy's fears or motivation but the first part of the film is played out in almost mute silence. A group of soldiers walk through Dunkirk without any conversation or discussion of their situation. Thousands of soldiers stand on the beach waiting for rescue with no-one apparently talking to each other. I'm sorry but this is just unrealistic. But then it's equally unrealistic for Tommy and his comrades to have walked through a clean and rather modern looking town of Dunkirk where there is no damage to any of the buildings, despite the fact that the enemy (don't mention the Germans) are attacking the place. Freshly swept roads, clean windows and picture perfect sandbags for the French army to hide behind - surely the filmmakers could have built a decent set to depict a war damaged section of town?Christopher Nolan has said that he wanted to avoid CGI in this film and opt instead for a realistic approach. Okay, CGI has become all pervasive in modern films (and some of it is downright cheesy) but there's surely no reason why it couldn't have been used in this film to create the illusion of more soldiers on the beach or extra boats out at sea. Trying to depict such a large scale and epic event as Dunkirk in a realistic and authentic way is virtually impossible without using some CGI.The cinematic device of three different story lines being told on three separate timescales just doesn't work in this movie. The constant jumping back and forth between the different threads leads to some jarring continuity effects. One minute the sky is overcast, the next it's clear and sunny. One moment it's nighttime, the next it's daytime. It's a shocking mess.Halfway through the movie I found myself shifting around in my seat feeling increasingly irritated and it wasn't just the misadventures of our ""hero"". I realised it was the background music causing my discomfort; a relentless, monotonous assault on the ears. War might be hell but this soundtrack isn't far behind. When the small boats arrive at Dunkirk, a stirring rendition of 'Nimrod' from Elgar's 'Enigma' variations is played, albeit played at quarter speed. Is this really counted as being an original music score as stated in the credits? Sadly the answer appears to be yes because Elgar's music is no longer under copyright protection. The fact that somebody got credit for writing this particular section of ""original"" music is absolutely shameful.The clichés: when Tom Hardy's pilot has a problem with his fuel gauge and has to start making manual calculations on what fuel he has left, what are the chances that he will actually run out of fuel before the film ends? Well knock me down with a feather! He's run out of fuel. Gosh, I never saw that plot twist comingThe young boy who jumps on the small boat at the last moment as it leaves England, not realising (in his naivety) that it could be a dangerous journey. What are the chances of him being badly injured or even dying? Oh look he's dead. Surprised? Well only by the manner of his death and the lack of concern from the skipper of the boat when told of what's happened.What are the chances that our brave Spitfire pilot (who's just ditched in the sea) is going to be rescued from drowning at the very last second as the water laps over his head? What a cliffhanger! Our small boat gets there in the nick of time to save the day! On the edge of my seat and holding my breath with excitement? Er, no.Then we have that ridiculous ending. After shooting down an enemy plane (don't mention the Germans) Tom Hardy runs out of fuel. In an outstanding display of flying skills, our pilot extraordinaire not only manages to glide his Spitfire up and down the beach a couple of times but shoots down a Stuka bomber in the process before making a picture perfect landing on the beach as the sun sets. Why bother landing on the beach? He could have flown back to England in time for tea and tiffin. As the sun goes down he destroys his aircraft so the enemy (please don't mention the Germans) can't get their hands on it. Quite frankly a crash landing would have been much more entertaining and an appropriate epitaph for this sorry farrago of a movie.Verdict? This film is a turkey."
17," Another overrated movie
","I do not understand why this movie gets such good reviews when it does not reflect how it really was. Where are the 400,000 people? Where are all the planes, the boats? The big ships that are hit by torpedoes or bombs roll over to the left side right away and sink, quite strange. Then you have a spitfire that runs out of fuel at a fairly low altitude, yet it's flying around forever and shooting other aircraft down before it lowers the undercarriage and lands well on the beach. They have also added a noisy background sound that becomes quite annoying in the long run. A disappointing movie that's not worth watching at the cinema."
18," Disjointed Mess! Shocking continuity issues make it an unbelievable yawn fest.
","*** This review may contain spoilers ***So, it looked promising and so lets start with the PROS; The intro sequence all 6 minutes (including the first dive bombing) should have continued for the whole movie - EPIC!That's it for pro's, really the rest will just make you depressed. CONS;A poorly cobbled together film without a story and achingly under- utilized actors.The awfully executed chronology lacked any reference or worthy explanation, exposing the glaring continuity issues and unbelievable plot mechanics. Sure tell a few different stories, but please at least maintain continuity WITHIN each story, it's as though the decision was made to have all these points of view early on - yet when it came time to film they did it over 2 days. A few extras lined up on a beach and some borrowed planes. F*$*. we are approaching the 2020's dammit - use some bloody good CGI as you clearly can afford it. The movie fails to portray even a 1/1000th of the actual evacuation - there were +- 330 000 troops leaving and over 60 000 killed ( thanks Wikipedia) yet ... Nolan fails to deliver any inkling of that sort of magnitude. The Brits left behind 63,879 vehicles including tanks and motorcycles + 2,472 field guns .... holy s*$(. but do we see a single tank or gun ... maybe 5 trucks and tug boat --- woo ooh ... also the ending is Horses excrement, climaxing with some stupid spitfire pilot who is SO worried about fuel, yet manages to fly around and engage bombers for the WHOLE FILM right up to, and after its engine stops ... SURE ... then it unbelievably swoops around with no engine (they obviously just cut the sound to make it look like the engine had stopped) and then swoops past TWICE along the beach and it is assumed by the plot that it engages and SHOOTS DOWN an approaching Stukka dive bomber -NO! NO! I CALL BULLSH$T MR NOLAN! So major bullsh%t climax moment out of the way, onto the meat and bones of this cut and pasted high school conceived garbage pile.Day, morning, evening, rough seas, very calm seas - NEVER bloody mind - just SHOOT the scene dammit! The ""DAY"" progresses achingly slowly and even although we see two sunrises / sunsets / a storm and everything in between we are meant to believe it all happens during these story points, what LAZY film making .... I do not believe. I never much cared for this Mr Nolan chap - and now after wasting my few dollar I feel confused for the future of film making and even more disappointed than ever for the general intelligence of the world. Are audiences/critics really that shallow / attention deficit that they cannot come up with an honest review so that others may find out before wasting time and effort? pathetic for a $150 Million budget. If i could SAVE 50k p/a i'd have to work for 20 YEARS just to make 1/150th of the budget... and yet THIS is the result. These people are living in a ridiculous reality paid for by you and I>"
19," Micro as opposed to macro version of the battle
","Saw an early screening tonight in Denver.I don't know where to begin. So I will start at the weakest link. The acting. Still great, but any passable actor could have been given any of the major roles and done a great job. I know almost no more about the battle of Dunkirk after seeing the film than I did before, and I am not exactly a WWII historian. Truth be told, I learned all I know about the battle of Dunkirk from the movie poster. Does that weaken the film? Hell no, this is a film about survival. The opening scene tells it all and sets the stage as we get our first glimpse into a young soldier's need to stay alive, and his creative attempts to do so. That actor may even be considered the main character of the film. More words have been written so far in this review than he speaks. And I have no clue who the actor in that role is. It is humorous that Tom Hardy looks like Bane through most the film in the role of a pilot wearing an oxygen mask throughout. Kenneth Branagh is the only officer with any lines in the film, so that should give you an idea of the POV that we experience. We are the enlisted man trying to find a way to stay alive in a chaotic and harrowing battle. Though I believe Dunkirk will win every single technical Oscar, I would be surprised if it has any acting nominations at all.How does Nolan elevate this above other films of a similar nature? I think he says it best himself, when he describes Dunkirk as a thriller more than a war film. He pulls that off superbly.When a ship starts to take in water as numerous bullets penetrate its hull, I wanted to jump out of my seat and cover up the holes myself.The film has three separate stories that are titled Mole, Sea and Air. And we all know where Moles live. The way the narratives of the three stories unfold and how they are all tied together is what makes the film a masterpiece. Much has been said about Nolan using IMAX film cameras and how the film is enriched by this. I don't know. I doubt I saw actual film being projected at my screening. Every frame looked terrific though. So what is the most superlative aspect of the film? Gotta be the soundtrack. Hans Zimmer will win the Oscar for this without a doubt. So , so brilliant. This is not a soundtrack that I would buy at the store and play on my stereo. This is a soundtrack that weaves throughout the three narratives seamlessly and creates this phenomenal sense of tension. There are times when a two or three minute tense orchestral passage plays continuously as the story shifts from the ground to the sea then to the air and the music draws the three stories together. Zimmer's soundtrack reminds me of the way that Bernard Hermann's work was so vitally important in building suspense in most Hitchcock films. Though that description almost sells Zimmer short. His soundtrack is that good.I don't think this is a film that will retain even half of its strength in your home theater. No folks, this is a film that you cough up for an overpriced IMAX ticket and rationalize it by knowing that experiencing Dunkirk in any other fashion will just not cut it."
20," Oh no :(
","Let me say I really wanted to like this film. I avoided seeing the previews or any reviews so I could go in unbiased which is how I like to see all of my movies. I don't like to rubbish the hard work that people put into their films because I enjoy really well made films. But in short I really wish someone told me to avoid this one. I'm not one to follow the flow and praise something that is clearly so very bad.The bad: The music\noise\soundtrack...whatever you want to call it was terrible. Just random esculations of horned instruments that build up and up and up to nothing. It was way too distracting and completely failed to build the suspense. I found myself looking around the cinema at the speakers wondering when the projectionist was going to realise he had accidentally turned the sound up too loud for the movie.There is zero character analysis. Everyone looks the same and you cant distinguish anyone from anyone else throughout the film. It doesn't matter anyway because you don't have any reason to care about anyone in particular because there is no back story of anyone. The plot is flat dry and boring. Don't get me wrong it was based on an important event in history but this film does this no justice at all.My biggest gripe is the lack of dialogue throughout the film. Was Nolan trying something new here? Probably but please don't do it again. There are shots of what are meant to be hundreds of thousands of soldiers all standing in lines on the beach all deathly quiet staring out to the ocean in most scenes. Even the terribly injured lying on stretchers are mutes.So many scenes don't add any value and don't make any sense. The stupidity of trying to force a single 60kg soldier off a sinking ship to reduce the overall weight of a boat stuck on the sand? I mean really...who writes this stuff. The boat is taking on hundreds of litres of water and you want us to believe that one person will magically raise the boat off the beach? It's a head shaking moment that just makes no sense at all.The whole thing is a b grade made for TV matinée crossed with the overly long 50 yard stares reminisce of a bad episode of the days our lives. The Dad in the boat couldn't care less that his son dies. He almost seems content. The plane scenes are slow and boring. They show little tactics and make us believe the entire German airforce was fought off by 3 spitfires. And don't get me started on the spitfire that somehow manages to linger in the air long after its engine has stopped for what seems like an eternity. Some say that Spitfire is still flying around without any fuel to this day. As my mate said, he didn't have to land on the beach, he could have flown all the way back to London.I heard the budget was 150 million. That's got to be a joke. There is just no way. Either that or the majority of the scenes ended up on the cutting room floor. You certainly didn't have to pay your actors for speaking roles.It's such a shame. This movie has so little going for it. Maybe the editor was coming down off a week long coke bender when he put this together because I have no doubt I could have done better with the raw footage and a PC version of Adode Premier.Wait for DVD release and a night when you are not really into watching a movie to pop this one in. You wont miss the atmosphere of a cinema for this movie because there is none to talk of. I apologise for being so harsh but I would prefer an apology from the director for killing my expectations. 3/10 is very generous indeed."
21," Disappointing film on such a worthy story
","A very big letdown for such a moment in history. Recommend wait for HBO. Editing was terrible posting a foolish timeline that made no sense, midnight in France/daylight in England at the same time. Hundreds of small civilian boats assisted in the evacuation, not the dozens on the screen. Thousands of Brit Troops standing in lines exposed on the beach for evacuation with no ships in sight, waiting. Everything from an odd random torpedo scene to the rescued troops getting pulled into boats, soaking wet in oil/seawater then getting off in England wearing dry crisp uniforms.The best dramatic gimmick? A valiant RAF pilot flies over the beachhead till he runs out of fuel, but he still has time gliding to shoot down one more Hun plane. That creates that final (5 minute) moment in the film where he quietly glides across the beach, providing that requisite film shot of all the British stars watching, biting their lips with respect.Meanwhile, I am wondering why he is landing towards the German held beach? Then with all the emergencies on the plane (off course, landing gear won't come down) he continues to wear his high altitude breathing/comms headset? The plane lands, the pilot jumps out and stands looking at the dunes and approaching Germans. Now being filmed with the golden sunset lighting hue technique, we finally see the glowing pilot's face (IMO Tom Hardy, the best British Actor today) defiantly surrendering. You think they would have used real human stories from the event to tell the story... instead we get scenes created specifically for select stars who dropped by the set to spend the day shooting their lines. A wasted opportunity to tell an amazing story of how the civilian armada saved the day."
22," Its official. Movies are no longer about telling a story.
","I am sure that the critics that write the reviews are paid shills because anyone who considers that movie to be a masterpiece has either never seen a war movie or is just taking money to lie to the public.Dunkirk was more spectacular than 7 or so boats, 3 planes and less than 300 men in a line on a beach. And whose idea was it to pay Tom Hardy a ridiculous sum of the budget to once again hide his face and never actually do what he is paid to do which last I checked was acting? It's obvious he was used in this movie to give it some credibility just like they did with the Mad Max debacle where he spent 3 quarters of the movie with a face covering on preventing him from speaking. The noise was awful and apparently some of that noise was considered to be music! Dull bass throbbing in every scene.Story? Lets not even go there. I can sum up the Story in one paragraph although you cannot really consider it a spoiler because there's nothing in this to spoil. ""Trapped on a beach awaiting rescue but the ships keep getting destroyed by dive bombers with only 3 planes to protect those ships. Ends with Hardy finally revealing his face when he is captured after landing his plane which has run out of fuel.""That's it. Everything else in between is just noise. To the people who consider themselves to be critics I say this: If you want the movie industry to become like the gaming industry where the main goal is most profit in shortest time regardless of the content then keep spouting the BS otherwise you need to start telling the truth for once. Two hours of noise and it cost them $100 million to make? It's obvious where that money went because these so called movie creators couldn't even be bothered to use CGI to expand the number of men, ships and planes to really set the scene. There was nothing in this movie and Tom Hardy was thick or corrupt enough to be used as the marketing tool. Don't waste your money."
23," The worst Nolan's film ever
","Very disappointing because of:*The worst voice quality of the recently watched films - terrible *Bad start ever, asphalt road, clear walls etc!!! *Too sterile pictures, sights - every body who starts a research will see on the old 1940s photos of Dunkirk that roads , buildings and coasts were full of mess, debris etc. *The casts have no faces, names like zombies - only a died boy's name - George- remained in my mind. There is no really main character(s) *Very poor views of the dogfights *Poor picture quality -grain noisy and sometimes the objects is out of focus- and camera movements compared example to the War for the Planet of the Apes - over all the best quality every levels, sound, voice, picture quality, camera movements actors performances etc.- and compared to other IMAX movies *I gave only 1 point because of these reasons, the huge budget and the very professional A list directors, crews and actors. The bottom of the B category for ~150 mil.Finally I was a big Nolan fan but now I am very disappointed and a bit up set in turn I'm and my family big fan of the cinemas especially ODEON ISENSE with Dolby Atmos. Usually I didn't do reviews I'm sick of this terrible movies."
24," Unapologetically, I can say this is one of the best war movies ever made
","If you read through the swarm of negative reviews, you might notice a common theme: boring, dull, lack of characters. It's incredibly disappointing that they seemed the miss the entire point of the film.This is not a film about heroic soldiers triumphing against all odds while blowing up Nazis with transformer-esque explosions.This is a movie about scenes, not characters. -and every scene is memorable, from the bombings to the torpedoes to the aerial dogfights. My co-worker, who is obsessed with WW2 planes, noted how incredibly perfect they got the British Supermarine Spitfire from the roar of the Rolls-Royce engine to the rattle of the components in the cabin. The accuracy and intensity of the dogfight was captured perfectly as well, mimicking the aerial maneuvers, firepower and damage in a realistic and dramatic fashion. The torpedoes noticed only moments before impact with it's slow monotonous movement sent chills of realization down my spine. Even in the beginning of the film, the way in which the Nazi leaflets were presented gave you some glimpse into the panic and anxiety felt by those soldiers.I felt the ""lack of characters"" was realistic and served the film as well. War is not about larger-than-life personalities with specialized weapons being bad-asses. It's about nameless and faceless soldiers facing an existential crisis, the possibility of randomized death, and how they can either respond with despair or hope.If you want characters you can root for and a happy ending where the bad guy in vanquished, then there are plenty of movies for you. But if you want a small glimpse into the despair, anxiety, hope, courage, and will of the British WW2 fighters then there is no better film ever made than this one."
25," Another hit from Nolan,very different approach to war genre..
","For the majority of his career Christopher Nolan has thrived in surrealism, whether it be focusing on caped crusaders or unchartered space missions. So it's intriguing to see him return to a narrative steeped in realism, and grounded by its commitment to real life occurrences. The results are staggeringly impressive too, while the talented filmmaker maintains his creative sensibilities, crafting a war movie that feels distinctively his.When thinking about war films, it's very hard not to go straight to the classics such as Apocalypse Now, Platoon or Saving Private Ryan.You have to make something very special to be mentioned in the same sentence as films like those.Naturally I was excited for the movie and I think most people were because we knew that it is Nolan's movie. From the opening shot of dunkirk you are in it and You are experiencing everything like you are there , there's never a dull moment or scene where characters sit around a campfire and say who you got back home no background stories. You don't get those kind of things in Dunkirk what you are used to see in war films yeah this could be a problem because you don't feel connected to specific characters and you are not connected emotionally but this movie is not like others there are many war movies and we have seen many similar things but this movie is not about individual it's completely about the event. It's about the evacuation like being in the middle of this horrific situation. According to my opinion When you are in a situation like this you don't say ""hey my name is.....what's yours where are you from - oh I thought we could have a conversation between all the bombs and planes firing constantly"" No this movie is in the moment and how Nolan show us the event It's what movies were invented for. everything on the screen look completely authentic there's never a moment that feels wasted. When I heard that it's only 106 minutes long I thought it should be 3 hours long movie but when I saw that it starts in battle and ends in battle I think it's perfectly made in one and half hour. And if you're expecting big arcs then sorry because sometimes in war people die alone and no one's there to comfort them or tell them it's going to be OK that's what make this movie so terrifying.""Dunkirk"" tells the story of a group of allied soldiers from Belgium, France, and the British Empire. When they find themselves surrounded by the Germany army on the beaches of Dunkirk, the film follows the story of the evacuation of 400,000 during the early stages of World War II.boasting an incredible cast, Christopher Nolan allows his players to internalize the fear and emotion, and allow them to express it in the most aromatic and penetrating demeanor's. As Tommy, Fionn Whitehead makes an astounding mark in his feature film debut. With no true lead in the movie, his point of view is often a crutch for the audience to rest upon, as his internalization of the character is one of the film's most pivotal high points.It is gripping from its very opening moments, in which we see soldiers getting picked off by invisible snipers in the middle of the titular town as propaganda flyers shower from overhead, announcing to the British, French, Canadian, Belgian and Dutch troops that they are hopelessly penned in by the Germans.We are in the early months of World War Two.Christopher Nolan makes the decision to avoid all of this explanation, and to give us a Dunkirk that focuses on the personal experiences of the war by land, sea and air The sea battle is also done very well from a technical perspective. We get a sense of the claustrophobia of being aboard ship, the shell-shock and the terror of a watery death, especially when combined with lit gasoline. I thought the acting was by far the best in this segment. I very much liked Mark Rylance's quiet earnestness as a civilian sailor sailing to Dunkirk with his son - the quiet communication between the two of them with glances - the profound sympathy toward Cillian Murphy's traumatised rescued RAF pilot. And the scene of soldiers drowning under a fiery sea is one of the most memorable and rightly horrific in the film.Dunkirk is edge of your seat filmmaking. Can honestly say I've never seen anything like it.A lot of people were wondering about Harry_styles & unknown cast. They're all great but Dunkirk is not about any one solider. Also 'Dunkirk' is another brilliant collaboration between Nolan & HansZimmer. The way he mixes in a ticking clock with score is nail biting.DUNKIRK relies on very little dialogue.We all know what happened on that beach, but Nolan's take is worth visiting. Yes, DUNKIRK relies heavily on sound of an increasingly fast ticking clock to build suspense.Drop everything and go watch Dunkirk. It is an experience. Not a mere film."
26," How do you type a yawn sound?
","where to start ... WW2 ended over 70 years ago, so I thought it was the time to tell true stories about what happened back then, but I guess I was wrong, and the allies still need some sort of ego- boosters, where the Germans are portrayed as dumb with fighters made of paper. The movie is very boring and slow to be categorized under war genre, and you can see that clearly even on the faces of the actors ... 400,000 soldiers trapped on a beach, should be a movie scene that everyone will remember for years, yet all we saw were few bored soldiers standing in lines as if they were waiting for bathroom... the lines of people at movie theaters who went to watch this movie looked more crowded and alive than the 400K !! And where are all those civilians boats which everyone was talking about? I thought it was gonna be a huge fleet, yet they were no more than a dozen of them !!!! I am not gonna mention the background music as this was a disaster which needs a separate review by itself... save your time and maybe spend your money on buying any WW2 game which will be 100 times more exciting than watching this"
27," Wars do not win by evacuation, but in this very salvation there is a victory © Dunkirk
","A talented boy named Christopher was not indifferent to cinema since childhood. His first ""home-movie"" he tried to shoot, barely ten years old, armed with his father's 8-millimeter camera. The main roles in the first ""movies"" of a small fan of the ""Star Wars"" were played by the toy soldiers donated by the father (unfortunately, the permanent companion of Christopher's film career, Michael Kane, at that time was ""intercepted"" by Richard Attenborough for filming in another war movie). Almost 30 years of persistent directorial work. 9 full-length films, each of which is not familiar with the rental fiasco. Total fees of more than $ 4 billion for all work and a ""loud"" name. In the age of glory sin can not remember youth? And so, in the jubilee project, ""Dunkirk"" - Christopher Nolan returns to his first ""director's"" experience - military history. Only ""soldiers"" this time - not a toy.Taking your favorite 70-millimeter film, a lot of natural scenery (minimum digital recording and green screens, gentlemen, only old school), loyal comrades (Zimmer, Van Hiteim, Crowley, Smith), and got several working ""Spitfires"" and ""Messerschmitt"", Christopher says: ""I want to shoot a visually beautiful movie."" And in Dunkirk he did it in his corporate style - with the inherent color effects a la ""The Dark Knight"", the epic scenes of air battles, the sinking of ships and the endless ""bombing"" that look no less qualitative than the fall of Cooper in Gargantua or a scene with a wave in Interstellar. But this was clearly not enough. And Christopher Nolan proclaimed: ""More realism!"". Operator Hoyte Van Hoytem should not be repeated twice. He unhooked a 100-kilogram IMAX 3D camera from a suspended tripod and, in an old-fashioned way, took off all the ""ground"" scenes from his shoulder. Voila, ""Dunkirk"" becomes the first film where IMAX shooting was done ""by hand"" - the work received a lot of realistic scenes from the face of desperate British troops, filled with panic, Nolan confirmed the title of ""experimental film-maker"", and Van Hoite moderately missed the gym . Ideally.""Dunkirk"" is a screen reproduction of the famous in the history of Great Britain operation ""Dynamo"". In 1940, nearly 400,000 discouraged allies (mostly British) were pushed back by the German army to the small French port city of Dunkirk, on the English Channel. In conditions of total economy of military resources, involving civil courts, Great Britain begins the largest rescue operation. Christopher Nolan offers us his vision of these events and gives us a chance to look at them from three angles. Firstly, from the air - on behalf of the pilots of the Royal Air Force, at all times seeking through the strait to help their associates. Secondly, from the sea - on behalf of the crew of a small civilian ship, which is also sent to Dunkirk to assist in the evacuation of the British corps. And, thirdly, on behalf of desperate soldiers, who are eager to survive and get home, at any cost.
Christopher Nolan, in spite of his fears, was inspired not by the Spielberg story of the salvation of Private Ryan and not even by Stoun's ""Platoon"", but (!) ""Nonstop action"" - ""Speed"" and ""Unmanaged."" The genre of ""Dunkirk"" smoothly balances between the ""vigorous"" thriller and worthy ""war-movie"", and the suspense - just off scale. In addition, the director immerses us in a non-linear narrative, saturated with flashbacks and endless action in the spirit of the film ""Remember."" We can observe the picture of the bombing of the shore from the land, and in a few minutes - the same scene, but already from the fuselage of the Spitfire.A few words about music. Oh, the seventh was scorching. Hans Zimmer, are you human? From the very first minutes, the soundtrack began, which did not end at all until the final credits, alternating only its tempo. Due to this, ""Dunkirk"" looks in one breath, in the truest sense of the word. I do not want to go into a detailed description of the impressions - I just wait for Zimmer's music to be called the classics of the 21st century.But fans of the deep ""Nolan"" story are waiting for the sad news. In ""Dunkirk"" the director, not wishing to go beyond the historical framework, relied on reliability and coverage. There is a minimum of metaphoricality, a minimum of a unique fantasy, a minimum of understatement with respect to the plot and a maximum of understatement with respect to the characters. Calling the main character (Finn Whitehead) by the name ""Tommy"" (if we collectively called the Germans ""Fritzes"", the Germans generally called the British ""Tommies""), Nolan seems to seek to ""generalize"" and project on his fate and feelings the experiences of all who was in this situation - to create the effect of an impersonal mass. All this reminded me madly Remarque and his ""On the Western Front without Change"" - a real war, without ""superheroes"" (and was it not for this that the ""eminent"" cast was slightly overshadowed?), Impregnated with despair, a thirst for survival and whistling bullets from an invisible enemy.Caesar could simultaneously read one text and dictate another. Walter White - at the same time teach chemistry and ""cook meth."" Well, and Christopher Nolan damn well knows how to combine the position of a talented screenwriter and an unrivaled director. And, perhaps, he once again proved it.
""Dunkirk"" is the tenth, anniversary work of Christopher Nolan. ""Powerful"" historical film with an invigorating suspense and dizzying visualization. A minimum of digital effects, a maximum of material props and ""cardboard"" decorations - a balm for the soul for all fans of the ""old school"" of cinema. Unfortunately (or not), the ""genius"" of the play played to the detriment of the ""uniqueness"" of the script - the fans of ""Beginning"", ""Prestige"" and ""Interstellar"" will definitely wait for some disappointment. In all other respects, the signature handwriting of the master of a large-scale movie is felt in every minute of the time-keeping.You will like this movie, ladies and gentlemen, rest assured. Enjoy watching!"
28," Bland, Boring, Revisionist Take on Dunkirk
","As a WWII buff (listening to ""The Longest Day: Music From The Classic War Films"" as I type), I had expected to be first in line when this film came out but I hesitated after reading initial reviews. While extremely positive, many reviews commented on aspects of the film, from the non-linear narrative structure to the choice of characters focused on, that left me feeling that I would not enjoy the movie. I finally broke down and saw it because of its continued box office performance but found it as lackluster as I'd feared.Present-day WWII movies just don't hold a candle to the classics (All Quiet on the Western Front, The Longest Day, Bridge on the River Kwai, Patton, and my all-time favorite film, The Great Escape), nor even big-budget mediocre fare from relatively recent times like A Bridge Too Far or The Battle of Britain. There's way too much pretentious nonsense in modern war movies. Every filmmaker these days has to make a ""statement"" about the horrors of war, as if intelligent viewers weren't already aware of that fact. Therefore, instead of a good story with appealing and memorable characters we get one that focuses on ""the coward,"" because in the modern-day mindset, anyone who acts in war with dignity and courage and self-sacrifice is seen as unrealistic and somehow a dupe of the evil powers that be. None of those characters was remotely interesting or appealing and the time shifts were totally unnecessary. In addition, the omnipresent music was a total turn-off. There was never any chance to actually hear the real sounds of war, which includes silence and the banter of soldiers trying to make the best of a bad situation. All told, this is the most-overrated movie I've seen in years. Thank God I have the classics on VHS and DVD."
29," Underwhelming and myopic
","The evacuation of Dunkirk was one of the most important moments in history, and a pivotal part of WWII. This movie had the opportunity to express the greatness and the gravity of this event, and it failed. The flyover shots of a few dozen soldiers on the beaches, when there should be ten of thousands, failed to express the enormity of the situation. Similarly the dozen or so civilian boats, when there should have been thousands, underwhelmed their contributions. The attempt to humanize the story by showing a few individual vignettes, in one case a single incident shown from multiple perspectives, also failed. No one character was engaging enough to impress the tension or magnitude of the situation. In essence this movie made a momentous and terrifying event a little boring. In doing so, it does a disservice to those that have experienced combat."
30," Not what I expected
","I can't understand how it can get 8.4 rating. Technically great, I mean, high level images and direction. But: first of all, why would Nolan add the past and future in all of his movies? I didn't find any empathy, emotions, with respect to other war movies. The final reminds me of the usual war movies made in US. And two actors as Tom Hardy and Cillian Murphy, almost not showing at all. I acknowledge Inception and Interstellar are great movies, although not 'my type', but this is not a great movie as they said."
31," THe worst movie on WWII
","I am fully disappointed with that movie. Brazilian specialized press is saying that is the best movie of the year. Elio Gaspari in his papers' column said today the movie is excellent. I fully disagree. First of all it is a boring movie. I had two or three times the wish of leaving the theater. As a matter of fact, some guys did so. Second, is a quite illogical movie, regarding space and time. They mixed together time shifted events, and I just realized that reading the critics. Third is a type of horror movie in which the intention is to scare you. Why the sound is so loud? I had the impression Count Dracula would show himself up to bite some soldiers' neck. After spending and loosing 5USD with the ticket and regretting not to leave the theater before movies end, I realized that was the worst movie on WWII ever shot. I dare to say that is the worst movie ever shot about any war, not just WWII."
32," Let me save you some cash and time
","This is absolutely the most boring movie I have sat through. Little dialogue, characters you couldn't care less for, most of the dialogue is mumbling, the score is annoying, the time-line is confusing to say the least. There were 350,000 men on that beach, in the movie there are a couple hundred at most. Full of cliché lines that make you cringe. No enemy, no stakes, no obstacles for the protagonist whoever it was."
33," So - Where's Dunkirk?
","For grey-haired Brexiteers like me, weaned upon a diet of 1950's British stiff-upper-lipped-ness (BSULN), a modern movie re-kindling that - now long lost - spirit was surely a must-see. I hadn't been to the cinema in donkeys' years; put off not so much by modern movies (which are bad enough) but by audiences of ignorant huge-headed bag-crackling crisp-crunching gas-bags who came to ruin the whole experience. And with a comfy chair, big HD telly and unlimited Stella, it would take something special to prise me off the cushions and fork out over £13(!). Well, if any word might do it; ""Dunkirk"" might. If ever a word conjures up notions of legendary BSULN - Dunkirk is that conjurer's word. I have a DVD of the much cherished 1950's version featuring those grandees of wartime spunk, John Mills and Dickie Attenborough, not to mention a reassuring dollop of Bernard Lee. It's an excellent work from start to finish. Every aspect of the great debacle and culminating ""miracle"" is included and carefully edited into a coherent story, from home-grown civilian cynicism about the ""phoney"" war, the collapsing French defence, discussions at High-Command, desperate British regrouping, French refugees, mountains of abandoned logistics, slaughter on the beaches and final deliverance. It ain't no masterpiece, but it's a very coherent, sterling work of typically understated performances, representing people with sufficient depth that you can care about them and their fate; all re-created by character actors who actually experienced both the war and the times.Cut to yesterday. This modern take on the great event is shallow in the extreme. Oh-sure; the combat scenes are visceral enough with sound levels fit to cause tinnitus, but coherent story telling? believable characters? An overview of the great historical event? Forget it! Considering the makers of this movie had almost unlimited funds and CGI, this should've resembled a Cecil B Demille epic. There were supposed to be over 350,000 allied soldiers trapped in Dunkirk! I swear I've seen more people in Tesco's at Christmas than are depicted here. The beaches seem practically empty. And those people to whom we are introduced appear two-dimensional, like cardboard cut-outs.The ""collapse"" is depicted by about half a dozen British Tommies walking negligently through suburbs, evidently unaware of the war, only to be mown down. One survives and encounters the French rear-guard. That's it. Time for a crap on the dunes. They're deserted, so what the hell? After that, there's a series of small set-piece conflicts drawn progressively together by the choppiest editing I've ever witnessed. All the characters are two-dimensional and unexplained. There's no back-fill story at all. A quite disproportionate amount of time is spent aloft with the RAF. Three whole Spitfires are presented almost reverentially, as if they alone turned the military tide. They skirmish with bombers and fighters, shooting down all they encounter with one quick burst of gunfire. The last one, running out of fuel, gracefully lands on the beaches of Dunkirk, in mellow westering sunlight, as the strains of Nimrod from Elgar's Enigma Variations grind away at half speed. It's frankly mythologising of the most juvenile kind. I almost laughed. (And incidentally; that Spitfire was travelling northeast along the Belgian coast, so the sun would have to be setting in the opposite direction!)If you're a millennial - the sort who wanders vacantly about the streets gaping into the screen of a mobile phone; someone with no more depth of character than those depicted here; raised upon revisionary history and brain-washed into being a bien pensant of the glorious European Union, this movie will seem as authentic as your friends on Facebook. But if you're of an earlier generation; you might want to watch the 1950's version at home, on the big telly, with the unlimited Stella. It's better in every way."
34," An absolutely outstanding depiction of a truly horrific event.
","I am always relatively confident that I'll enjoy the work of Christopher Nolan based off his pretty decent track record, however this gripping re-imagining of one of the darkest moments of World War II stands as not only some of Nolan's greatest work but one of the greatest war films I have ever experienced.Dunkirk does not necessarily tell the story of any one particular character, but rather adopts the event itself as the films vehicle, resulting in an experience which uses its characters to portray the event rather than the event to portray its characters. This is presented through scenes taking place at different stages of the evacuation across the land, air and sea, creating a distinctive setting for each, but culminating in the same final conclusion. This being said despite Dunkirk's focus not necessarily being its characters, I did not find a single character performance in this film lacking or inconsistent with the tone or setting presented technically. In particular Cillian Murphy, Mark Rylance and debut actor Fionn Whitehead gave especially memorable performances consistent with the striking spectacle Nolan presents. As is expected with Christopher Nolan's films the visual presentation in Dunkirk has few rivals, the set pieces are outstanding with the use of breathtaking establishing shots to highlight the true historical scale of the real life evacuation. Action is presented in a smooth focused manner utilizing a few precise shots rather than an explosion of two second jump cuts we have come to expect in modern day action movies. There are multiple sequences which portray the pure fear, claustrophobia and disorder present in those final weeks of the evacuation and it is this ever present tension that will keep you engaged for the entirety of the run-time. However it is the sound design which truly made this production a masterpiece for me, delivering one of the most realistic representations of the terrifying sounds of War. Gunfire had a distinctly different tone to other films, being delivered with sharp crack, explosions where accompanied by a deep base and the famous 'Jericho Trumpet' made by the Stuka's presence be constantly reminded and portrayed the sense of helplessness present at Dunkirk perfectly.This is only enhanced by Hans Zimmer's excellent soundtrack embedded across the entirety of the film. Alongside Inception, Dunkirk showcases the exceptional talent Nolan & Zimmer have for combining meaningful score with striking imagery to create a distinctive emotional response from their audience. Through the skillful incorporation of an ever presenting droning base, screeching guitar strings and ticking timepiece the continual sense of urgency and dread felt by those both on land and sea is enforced across the entire film by this excellent soundscape. As a result I highly recommend that should you be given the chance you experience Dunkirk for the first time on the big screen, as the combination of a cinema screen and encapsulating surround sound will leave you with a truly memorable experience. Even though this is a film a majority will go into undoubtedly knowing the final conclusion, Dunkirk is an experience I highly recommend everyone consider, presenting a defining moment of modern history in one of the most technically accomplished and memorably striking ways, Dunkirk will undoubtedly go down as a hallmark in film-making for many years to come."
35," The worst movie of 2017
","I went to the cinema with good expectations. A great war movie.. Well.. It's wasn't great, and it wasn't a war movie..400.000 men it said on the poster, if I would count there were at most a 1000.Surrounded by Germans it said, maybe it was at the time I went to the toilet but no Germans seen here..After 1 hour I really wanted to get out of the cinema, but I was not alone so eventually I stayed for the whole (too long) 1:45..Don't go and pay money for this, if you really want to see it despite the awfulness this movie is, watch it on Netflix and buy a lot of beer to drink the story through.."
36," A Must See.
","What a Brilliant movie. We saw this on the night of the World Premiere, intense and packed full of fabulous acting... The camera shots were absolutely spot on, and you couldn't look away for a second without missing a perfect scene. The entire score, coupled with the dialogue and videography made this film and I cannot wait to see it again."
37," Nolan's Perilous Masterpiece That Never Lets Up!
","Christopher Nolan. That name alone has the star-power of an acting giant. A name that once heard, turns the heads of an audience, whether it be a superhero movie, a science fiction epic... or a war drama, a typical moviegoer (even those less cinema-savvy or those who lack the traits of a ""cinephile"") will instantly be attracted to his movie at hand. We saw this with 'Inception', we saw this with 'Interstellar', and now we're seeing this with 'Dunkirk'. And my God, what a film it is. No film is truly flawless, but if a war film comes close to it, it's Nolan's new epic that does so.We've seen the tale of Dunkirk undertaken several times on screen before, whether back in the 1950's or during that stunning and sweeping shot in 'Atonement', but none have come close to the realism, the grittiness and the intensity that 'Dunkirk' bestows upon the audience. The tale of a retreat that was seen as heroism, wait what? Yes, you read that right, the retreat at Dunkirk became one of World War II's greatest tales of heroism in the face of adversity. How Churchill had asked to ensure that at least 30,000 troops made it home... that number instead came in at a steady 300,000, and not just British soldiers. French, Belgians and some Dutch, it was a tale of spectacle that truly required an honest account from an auteur capable of bravura direction... well that auteur is Nolan.We're all now used to Nolan's use of non-linear storytelling, and once again he utilises his famed formula to stunning effect, with three stories, each from the land, sea and air, all focusing on a different time frame, but effectively intersecting throughout. Our three heroes are newcomer Fionn Whitehead (land), Mark Rylance (sea) and Tom Hardy (air), each providing near-flawless performances. Lacking of actual dialogue, the sequences instead thrust the audience into a world of visual splendour and build the narrative through the use of sound and peril, the haunting and deafening sounds of diving Stukas, the ripping roar of the Spitfire's engine and the sudden silence, building to impending doom. The sound is this film's highlight, with Hans Zimmer returning once more to unleash yet another stunning score. Now, the cinematography, well what can I say? Hoyte Van Hoytema, take a bow, the imagery is both stark yet beautiful, its gritty yet serene, its claustrophobic yet sweeping... it's utterly encapsulating, from the opening shot, it draws you in, it takes you to that beach, it places you in the thick of it, and all the while avoiding the sight of the actual enemy in person, they're just lingering, unseen to the naked eye.One side note that I'd love to delve into is Harry Styles, wow what a shocking achievement. Alike Heath Ledger as The Joker, Nolan has turned an unlikely cast member into someone of true talent.In the 17 years of cinema-going during my life, I have seen some truly amazing movies, some that completely stunned me, many of which have been by the director at hand, including a fantastic IMAX experience of 'Interstellar', but never before have I left the cinema so awestruck, so silenced by the intensity of a movie. 'Dunkirk' isn't a typical movie, it isn't your typical war movie, this is more, much more. This is a film about the prevalence of heroism, the prevalence of Britishness, and how fear can strike drive and willpower into a human entity. This is a visual masterpiece, it is more than a movie, it's an experience, and one that should be witnessed by all!"
38," Nolan may have earned himself some high accolades come Oscar season
","No reviewer was lying when they said see this in 70mm IMAX (full disclosure, I saw this on a regular screen). In my opinion, it necessitates it. I can just ""tell"" from what I saw. The aerial shots alone would provide good reasoning for it, but the sound that those theaters provide with the big picture in front of you will captivate you exactly the right way.This isn't a social kind of film, and it certainly isn't popcorn entertainment. Not a summer blockbuster at all. This film's scope feels very small, even though it carries epic tones within. Nolan really broke a lot of traditional film conventions with this, and I think that exact kind of ambition is what makes this movie work for a more general audience. I somewhat think audience members need to know what they're getting into beforehand to be accepting of that fact, but once they are I think they will be just fine.On a technical level, I think this is Nolan's best yet. The Prestige still might get higher honors simply because of the more demanding writing that is involved, but given what Nolan intended to do, this nearly screams ""perfection."" Did he try and go for an R-rating? No. Did that matter? Not even close. Did he try and provide massive amounts of character development? No. Did that matter? Depends on who you talk to. I could honestly say that if there were two cuts of this film—an extended cut that develops the characters and this one—you could give us the option and we would find the one we enjoy more depending on what we're looking for. Did he look to vilify the Germans to the point of controversy? No. Did that matter? It didn't, but only one part does stick out for me (the ""one flaw"" that Nolan often has trouble with in his writing) and I'll get back to that in a moment.""Harrowing"" is easily my favorite word to describe Dunkirk. This is a survival film, and that's all it is. He put us on the beach, on the sea, and in the air. He gave the characters a want and will to live with an impending threat for which we understand its consequence, without need of showing thousands of deaths or lots of blood. When one moment of attempted survival ends, another one begins without warning. That doesn't mean the film is relentless action, but it certainly is relentless tension, if for no other reason than Hans Zimmer's score. I'm telling you right now, his score is my favorite part of the film. It's actually mostly a quiet kind of score, but it is frightening and works with the film so very well.Nolan has had a lot of trouble doing ""show, not tell"" in his past films. This time he has learned a lot, not letting the actors expose everything (acting was fine all around, by the way... not much to say about it honestly, as it's not the film's high point). I did not feel the presence of the surrounding enemies, though. If the film didn't tell us about it, I probably wouldn't have felt the pressure of getting off that beach sooner than later. Hearing the planes incoming was always scary of course, but as we only had the British perspective and a week-long time line at most, there simply wasn't a chance of feeling time cave in on them. This to me is this film's only real flaw.That being said, the only real limitation that holds this film back is that it's based in reality, which means that we are already aware of the outcome. I think for this particular story it's fine, because it's not one specific moment that lets us breathe again... so letting it play out the way that it did is okay with me. I do not think this will go over with people who come in completely uneducated about Dunkirk. I made a mistake in stating that I wanted this film to educate me on the evacuation story. I think I'd rather have learned about it first and then seen the film, kind of like seeing United 93 after having lived 9/11 (not totally, but I was at least cognizant of all that transpired). That doesn't mean to research the film itself, but rather just the historical event.I do hope that Nolan goes back to fictional work after this. Here was an awesome deviation from the norm that he chose to do, and he went out in grand style. I could have used a longer film with fleshed out character development, but this film also works as well especially in the month of July. I see this receiving many Oscar nominations such as score, editing, cinematography, visual effects, etc... I do not see any acting or writing awards... and yes, I see a director nomination as well. If the academy believes some of those earn him victories, then god damn it give him his Best Picture Oscar as well.I can't really yet rank this film with his other films, because it's just so different. I don't see too many of the Inception parallels here. Every film of his outside of Insomnia either does nonlinear or intertwining storytelling, but this one is without the cleverness involved in the script. It's just playing things out as they do. Survive. So to revisit, I believe this may be his best work yet, even if I don't know if it's my favorite of his. I really just want to put this in another category from other films entirely, in which case it's my favorite of ""that kind of film.""My heart is still pounding from this film. I simply cannot wait to see this in 70mm IMAX on Thursday."
39," Nope
","Too loud, too disjointed, too much Kenneth Branagh staring meaningfully into the distance. There seemed to be many scenes that would not be reasonable, starting with two soldiers encountering each other in an isolated location: they would not silently go about their business without confirming each other's identity. I thought I saw a spitfire that had run out of fuel first fly right-to-left, then left-to-right to land on a beach in front of the Germans, descending in daylight and landing in darkness. There was so much confusion as to what was being shown, and such loud ""music"" that it was difficult to follow the story. The critics seem to love this movie. I don't know why."
40," Masterpiece? NO! Historical? NO! Intense?NO
","Best war movie ever made, not by far. The only good thing about this movie is a few great cinematic camera shots and that is it. Lets see where to start (spoliers coming):1. Apparently German Army participated in the battle of Dunkirk; with 2 Henschel Hs 129 bombers, 3 dive bombers Junkers Ju 87 (Stuka's) and 3 Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighters, which were all apparently shot down by 3 RAF Spitfires. As that is the only German troops you will see the whole movie! Myabe they were not there? Batman got them on time? 2. You have two genius actors Sir Kenneth Branagh and Tom Hardy, but you write a scenario where both of them have 10 lines in the whole movie? I don't believe that Tom had more then 2 lines that lasted for 1 min. Now people will say, you don""t understand the story it self is a main character! That is all fine, but then I can watch Denkirk documentary, it is more intense then this! 3. Harry Styles should stick to music, as his acting is very One Direction. I mean everything is so predictable, you just look at him and know its a movie? There is no suspense in his acting, there is no character build up what so ever, etc.I could go on and on, many more things are bad about this movie, but I would be in danger to write more words than what are in screenplay of Dunkirk!Wait to come on Netflix, DVD or something, don't waist your money in cinema. PS I gave it a 3, it will probably end up around 7 when all hype dies, but I expected a historical intense masterpiece, and got nothing!!!"
41," Imagine the worst movie you've ever seen...
","...that movie was better than this. I've seen plenty of horror movies... but not one has terrified me more than seeing this prime example of what Hollywood has come to now. The two hours of this film were just a disgrace of what a rich studio can do for a quick paycheque. If Christopher Nolan wanted the audience to feel as shell-shocked and horrified as the characters in his movie, then he truly succeeded. I have never wanted to escape the situation of being in that theatre more than his characters wanted to escape that beach. First of all, this isn't your typical war movie. There was no bloodshed, no gore, not even any real violence, which some might find refreshing. However, there was also hardly any dialogue and zero character/plot development...you know, things you would expect in a basic movie. I wanted to care for the characters so badly, or anything that went on in this movie. But the scenes were either too dragged out, or they would cut out at odd times, leaving you with a general disconnect from what was going on in any scene. The only explanation for what went on was just in the form of incomprehensible murmurs from the actors. This movie was based on a heroic and honourable rescue mission, and if the audience was made known of this simple fact, it would have set such a better tone. This movie had so much potential. If Nolan focused more on plot development rather than aesthetics, this movie might've actually been worthy of the multiple Oscar nominations it is going to get. To sum it up, this movie is basically a beautiful war-themed music video on mute. If you can appreciate that as a movie, then maybe you will enjoy Dunkirk. As for me, I'd rather watch worms hatch eggs than come anywhere close to a movie like this ever again."
42," I am Embarrassed for Nolan!
","We saw Dunkirk on opening night, I was excited, I'm a huge WW2 buff. The incredible human drama at Dunkirk has mostly been overlooked by Hollywood. So July 20 has been on my calendar for a while. Boy did I fall for the hype!I must say something positive first... great war footage! I loved the spitfires! Knowing that Nolan shot this move with only a few post effects is impressive. The scenes inside the ships were fantastic.Now, onto the sad truth as I see it. I wish the producers would have spent some of the $150 million on a script. I didn't know you could shoot a historical period movie with a steep budget and not have one. It's as if this was just a big historical re-enactment of the Dunkirk rescue and the film crew said, hey, we should grab a couple of decent actors and throw some cheesy lines at them, we'll make a movie! There was an old-timer from the business that once told me, ""if you've got a great story you can shoot your movie thru banjo strings on black & white film"".I got the impression that Nolan was hell-bent on shooting realistic war footage and he fell in love with those shots and scenes, forgetting that the audience would appreciate a plot. There are so many interesting plot twists from the actual event. We never really saw anything from London, France or Germany where most of the strategy was planned. Nolan focused on the beachhead and the channel. The realism was quite good, but too long and confusing.The sound track had many problems too. The mix was hot, if you wanted to listen the sparse dialogue, good luck. For some reason the director chose to loop this maddening drone sequence throughout the movie. It was so obvious it had to be intentional. I was hoping the version we saw was just an advance copy with a rough mix, nope. One last thing, I'm not sure the average movie goer will appreciate the way Nolan repeated scenes. Apparently the footage was so good from 4 different angles we should show all of them, back to back. I get it, great film makers take chances. There have been many examples, especially in the indie- film world of masterpieces that tried risky new techniques, sadly, Dunkirk isn't one of them.To wrap this up... I'm glad I saw Dunkirk. I think most WW2 buffs will see it no matter what anybody says."
43," A good watch but not true to Dunkirk
","After many great reviews I decided I would go and watch this on the big screen for the atmosphere and in that at lease I have to say it was great. But and it is a big but, for a story I left feeling let down. This is no saving private Ryan or stunning epic as the critics would suggest. I am no history buff and I am from the other side of the world but even I know the story of Dunkirk and this just didn't live up the epic nature of the true story. The characters don't do the story justice, the timelines are blurred and the epic nature is missing. There are some great visual scenes and a few uplifting moments but it just didn't feel tied together.My rating is probably a bit harsh but I just don't rate this a one of the great efforts of story telling. If you didn't know anything of the actual events at Dunkirk this would leave you having missed the epic nature of what was achieved with 700 private boats over 8 days back in 1940."
44," Don't believe the HYPE. This movie is garbage
","After enduring this film I was blown away to discover the critical acclaim for this movie! Not to mention the IMDb user reviews! This movie took me to a whole new level of bland. To take one of the most significant events of World War 2 and turn it into THE most dull and bland cinematic experience of my life. The film was woeful. I have never been so detached from the characters in a film ever. I'm thinking the entire script would be lucky to fill more than a page. Not to mention the action. We have around 400,000 men needing evacuation. But it looked like a couple of thousand. There was no scale. The action was damn stupid from start to finish. Did they hire an expert? Hell no. I'm an ex soldier and that is not how any of that action sounds. Not to mention the cruddy no stakes PG 13 action. Did a main character just die? No idea. The editing was so terrible. And who cares if a character dies. There's no character development. So there's nothing to invest in. What a mess."
45," Christopher Nolan created an impressive blockbuster on World War 2, with the focus on survival.
","The most important lesson in the history of our humanity, surpassed in genre, religion among other moral aspects, is simply the survival of the species or a human being in question. Our most basic instinct is survival and when we unite, forgetting our differences (as a group of Individuals, not nations), for the sake of our survival and our well-being, the human race shines in the most intense sense possible. The cooperation between several elements, to come out alive from a complicated situation. One scene, caught my attention when a group of Allied soldiers were surrounded in a ship and this same ship was being attacked on all sides by the German troops. One of the characters was being forced out of the ship to see if the tide sea was rising or not. Out of fear, this character did not want to leave the ship, it was when an English soldier replied: for the others to survive, one person has to die.The theme of this film is survival, especially surviving in a difficult situation, is in itself a great victoryNothing is better expressed in this film and executed in a way with as much talent as Nolan achieved in making with this film. Not only by itself, the message is passed to the audience in a clear and perfect way as is demonstrated in small scenes that help convey this message and build a fitting end to the film itself.The film goes straight to the narrative and action of the movie without losing in passing with interesting monologues, unlike Inception, a film in which Nolan himself created a character with the sole purpose of explaining the rules of this universe for the audience, this is the apex of Nolan as a Film director and he performs his work in a simple and exemplary way. So Dunkirk is his smaller commercial movie, but with the bonus without unnecessary scenes that could crumble the experience of the film.The performances are excellent and accompany the director's talents (the direction of the film itself) and the script in a cohesive, simple and direct way, highlighting Fionn Whitehead, Mark Rylance and of course the very competent Kenneth Branagh. These excellent actors help immerse the audience in the cinematographic aspect of the movie itself to make the experience as real and emotional as possible.Again, congratulations to Nolan for choosing actors relatively unknown to the general public, but outstanding in their work of acting. Instead of trying to choose famous actors (whose private lives are always in the mouths of the people and the magazines), these people are celebrities and not actors. For this reason I never managed to pass the first act of Saving Private Ryan. Spielberg made a mistake filling his film with the most popular Hollywood All Star cast of famous actors at that time (their lives were so exposed that it was hard to see those people as soldiers or survivors of WWII). At this point, Nolan fared better than Spielberg.By completing this great experience, special and sound effects are applied in an exemplary way and these same technologies make almost perfect use of the IMAX screen. The technical and aesthetic aspects are very good, as it comes this habit in this type of film with this type of budget (105 millions). The cinematography is very good (almost perfect, like in most of Nolan movies) and the camera movements are agile and very beautiful.See the aerial combat of the characters of Tom Hardy (Farrier) and Jack Lowden (Collins) in aerial planes that looked with great and amazing beauty in fighting against the planes of the Germans. A technical amazing work of Nolan and his production team. Amazing, no doubt. Especially on the IMAX screen, where the film shows all its beauty, and if there is a movie that deserves to be seen in IMAX, it is one, this new work of Christopher Nolan, no doubt. The ambitious ideas of the filmmaker and the great sequences in parallel assembly that characterize his works. Making the storytelling move to viewers in three different locations (The Mole, The Sea and The Air). In a cohesive, precise and confusing way. This film shows a great talent of Nolan, and it reaches his talent to create sequences in parallel assembly the characters of the film in a brilliant way. The soundtrack composed by the veteran Hans Zimmer is amazing, Hans in turn creates a memorable theme for the theme of World War II. Fantastic and great.The great and only problem I see that disturbs the experience of the film is limited by the PG-13 and thus limit the blood and violence, for God's sake, it is a film about a war blood and violence are common. At times it seemed like I was looking at some scenes and these same scenes seemed so artificial and displaced from the film itself, like the scene of the soldiers corpses coming to the beach, or the English troops being smashed by the sinking ship (two clear examples that PG-13 influenced negatively the movie).One problem that some people go through seeing this movie is the lack of depth in some characters, however there are characters with depth, but not the kind of depth shown through dialogues or exposition. Nolan wanted to show something bigger. And I think Nolan did it. Nolan created in this movie to show the question of survival and its consequences in the lives of the people close to war and the soldiers who were fighting in that war. He wanted to show us how and survival define us, and I think he got the message very well across this movie. Even for this, he sacrificed some dramatic depth. Depth for certain characters, however Nolan passed a larger message, which surpasses any dramatically deep element. Nolan wanted to get something bigger. And in my opinion he did it."
46," Boooo!
","I honestly believe that if I had started a shouting ""boo"" at the end of this movie, I'd have had a large chorus in support. What the heck?Three different time lines of differing duration, where we are forcibly jumped back and forth without warning? It's daytime! No, wait, it's night. Oops! It's day again...hang on to the popcorn Martha, it's night again. Hey, wait a second... didn't that boat just sink?Whatever genius Nolan has inserted into this film is lost in the mishmash. I left not caring for a single character. I was wondering just how long a spitfire out of gas can glide? Apparently it's far longer on screen than might be the case otherwise.The good? A very promising opening. The bad... everything else, including the music."
47," Ruined by its soundtrack.
","What a disappointment! The worst part was the tooth rattling and incessant background bass beat that seemed only loosely related to the equally deafening and incessant score. More intrusive even then the ridiculous soundtrack in Gravity during the destruction of the space station in airless space, the beat and the score in Dunkirk drowned out what limited dialogue and atmosphere was present in every scene of the movie, even trespassing a bit on the hammy and over-extended scenes with Kenneth Branagh (no real loss there, I guess). When you can't hear the Merlin engine of a Spitfire from the cockpit, then you know there's a problem. Speaking of which, what can you say about Spitfire whose fuel and ammunition lasted forever, and whose terminal glide seemed even longer than that, and yet somehow apparently ended in the timely destruction of a Stuka mid-dive bombing?I cannot fathom the positive reviews this film received.It wasn't even that impressive as a spectacle. Where were the masses of abandoned equipment and materiel? Some stacked crates right at the start, and a single anti-aircraft gun? The opening scenes on the beach of Saving Private Ryan left an impression 100 times stronger than this entire film."
48," Boring and bad
","This movie is beyond bad:1. Annoying music: permanent background music that tries to convey dramatic moments for all the scenes, even undramatic scenes. I was annoyed 15 minutes into the film. 2 Hours later, was wondering why I didn't walk out of the film earlier. I counted at least 10 people walking out and not coming back. 2. Bad editing. The story unfolds from three different perspectives, which makes the scenes repetitive and adding nothing.3. Boring. Nothing really happens.4. Unrealistic. Without giving any spoiler, the movie does not represent at all the sheer magnitude of what happened in Dunkirk.Please don't waste your time watching this, not even on Netflix or TV."
49," This movie is terrible. Am I in the matrix?????
","Where do I start. I suppose it's that I feel compelled to write my first ever review. This is an abomination of a ""film"". From the horrific score to the lack of character. From the ear splitting sound design to way he tried to ""Nolan"" the chronology. From the dull screen play to the lack of any act structure it's a boring, aggravating mess. How is this getting such good reviews. I can only think that everyone, as I did, expected it to be another Nolan masterpiece!!!??? I've never wanted to leave a cinema more and I was forced to sit through the ungodly mess that was Transformers 5 last week."
50," Virtual Experience of war, chaos, horror and hope
","From a different viewpoint as this author walked down 101 floors of the South Tower on September 11. Worked for Aon and came away with not PTSD or dust-health problems (I was far uptown when the towers came down). So as I sat watching Dunkirk, the cummulative effect was to virtually relive aspects of THAT day for me. It's impossible to describe horror, fear and what it was like to BE there, or BE at Dunkirk. Many films and books (fondly MRS. MINIVER was the first). Or the heroic dogfights of BATTLE OF Britain. This one - far different. I came out of the theater feeling that I had just been through not only Dunkirk but 9-11 as well. It is THAT effective. The lack of dialogue for a good part of the film draws the viewer INTO the story as a real participant. YOU'RE THERE. Spielberg did it a few times such as the 20 minute Omaha Beach segment of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN but even that film became just a more intense version of the standard war film.Be prepared to have your life changed by this one. It's that damn good."
51," A Mess
","Once again the curse of Written and Directed by the same person strikes again!From the very start, we watch well trained (from my own knowledge of history - this movie provides no background), British troops run down the middle of the road when fired on. Even untrained troops must have the instinct to seek the nearest cover of a door or alleyway?The bland music is annoying, and was probably done to save time and money on background sound effects which would have added so much more to the drama.After bombs are dropped onto the crowded beach, soldiers die, but you hear no wounded crying out for help.The British Spitfires, while recreated extremely accurately, appear to have limitless ammunition.The time shifting is totally confusing. One moment we are watching a scene in bright daylight, the next it is night, then back to day again.What confused me most was when one pilot watched his wingman ditch, then he proceeded to shoot down a German bomber, after watching it in his rear view mirror for a while? Why would he do this? Why wouldn't he just turn and shoot it down?A little later we go back in time to be with the pilot ditching. He then struggles to get out of his plane, but is eventually rescued. A little later, he watches his wingman shoot down the bomber! Are you kidding me? Unless his mate had been circling above, and given the time frame from the previous scene, the bomber should have been shot down whilst he was still trying to get out of his downed plane, and it would have happened miles away from where he was rescued.Rather than provide a sense of the magnitude of Dunkirk, the film would have you believe, until one of the last scenes, that only a few large and small ships and boats took part. It doesn't show the lines of men in the water up to their shoulders waiting to be picked up. It doesn't even give you a sense of the time frame of several days.Indeed, the ships shown look too modern to be early Second World War destroyers.For those reviewers calling this the best war movie ever, I'm guessing this is the first you have watched.Now go see Band of Brothers, to see how a real war movie/TV series is done.Then see if you can find the original movie Dunkirk, starring John Mills, because although rather slow in places, this movie is still so much better than this new attempt."
52," Dunkirk: The Disney version.
","""The best world war 2 movie to date""? Really? As a guy who have been brought up on ww2 movies, I had to attend the first showing. Especially since there were so many ""best ever"" headlines. So there I went.This movie is one long action sequence that stretches 106 minutes. But if you deduct the number of times that the exact same situation is shown, but from a different camera angle at another time in the movie, it barely passes the 60 minute mark. And after Hardy shoots down his fourth German plane, a stuka divebombs for the fifth time towards the beach, or Branagh looks up in the sky for the 7th time, it gets repetitive. This actually felt like one long teaser prologue to 'Battle of Britain'. (If the rumors are true that Ridley Scott is doing his take on Battle of Britain, all I can say is: get busy!)In 'Dunkirk' there's almost no dialogue, no conflict between any of the characters, no character development at all and the enemy is completely faceless. So this makes it a rather forgettable movie for me, unlike 'Hacksaw Ridge', 'Saving Private Ryan' and many of the other great world war 2 movies, that show war like it is: bloody. 'Dunkirk' is rated PG-13, which will sure please all the young Harry Styles fans. In retrospective: The 5-minute Dunkirk segment (all shot in one take, an available on You Tube) from the movie 'Atonement' still makes a much larger impression to me, than I think Nolan's first (and hopefully not last) world war 2 movie forever will be doing.But besides that - what Nolan (and collaborator Hans Zimmer) always do really well however is to create suspense, and there are some real nailbiting scenes in there, which make the ticket almost worth it.I left the theater disappointed, though. Expected it to leave a larger impression. It didn't. If you would have preferred 'Titanic' to be a movie that started right when the ship began sinking, 'Saving Private Ryan' to be all about the Omaha beach landing, and 'Braveheart' to be all about the battle of Sterling and Fallkirk, you don't mind cardboard characters, and you often find yourself muttering ""when do they get to the action-part?"", then 'Dunkirk' is definitely for you. For people who enjoy movies for emotional context, also: be advised that you won't find it here."
53," The film company must have spent the $150M on setting up false ratings
","The subject matter provided so much potential, so much opportunity - but instead it is unbelievably bad in almost every possible respect. It may have been closer to a Battle of Britain film than about Dunkirk.For a film about Dunkirk I would watch the old one from the 1950's which is a little slow at the beginning as they develop the characters - but in the end the film so so much better having characters in it.I guess the budget must have run out though - they didn't have enough money to buy any German uniforms. You don't see any German troops fighting. Even when they are in the boat all you see is bullet holes appearing but you don't see the Germans. Then at the very end of the film you see the pilot being taken prisoner by two Germans who are blurred out! Why was that?"
54," This movie was so rich, so detailed and so profoundly moving that it's hard to put it into words. Christopher Nolan is back and he's here to show us what a master can create.
","This review will be mostly spoiler free but I don't want to be banned so I clicked it just to be safe..The basic plot revolves around the 450,000 odd British soldiers trapped in Dunkirk, France as the German troops close in. They don't close in on foot though, instead opting to pick the trapped soldiers off from the air and sea.This movie isn't a propaganda piece touting the glory of British resilience; most of the movie is just young men trying to survive, petrified for their own lives. The threat is ever present, there was a wonderful sense of tension throughout the entire movie. You really felt the cinema shake as the German planes closed in on the soldiers and let loose their bombs and you can feel the thick fog of fear.The enemy in this movie is very interesting because you never actually see a German face. The enemy is just a looming threat and comes in the shape of torpedo attacks and bombs from planes. I read that Nolan spent a lot of time studying silent films and how they built tension which is pulled off masterfully in this movie. Like the movie Gravity once this movie begins there is no down time, they are constantly being attacked in one way or another.The casting for this movie was absolutely superb. Our very own Barry Keoghan had a short role that I would liked to have seen fleshed out more but he pulled it off very well. Cillian Murphy was wonderful as always and played the role of a shell shocked soldier. Mark Rylance stole the show for me and put on a stellar performance as the father who is doing his duty to his country. His bravery never fades. Fionn Whitehead and Aneurin Barnard were excellent choices and I liked how Nolan chose largely unknown and inexperienced actors to mimic how young and inexperienced the soldiers really were during the war.When I heard that Harry Styles was in this movie I figured that it was just a clever ploy to pull in more ticket sales but I absolutely stand corrected. He put on an authentic, honest performance that was very impressive. There's a great scene in a boat where you see how he is affected by desperation and sheer terror that really sold it for me, his performance was extremely consistent.Tom Hardy is a chameleon... Any role he plays he is completely dedicated and immersed and you can't peel your eyes away from him. He has some of the most nail biting scenes and his scenes toward the end of the movie were very emotional and moving.Strangely enough some parts of the movie felt like watching old WW2 footage; it was grainy and real. This movie didn't rely on CGI, it was gritty and honest and beautifully shot.You really can't talk about a Christopher Nolan without talking about Hans Zimmer and the soundtrack. There were some scenes that were reminiscent of the docking scene in Interstellar because the music flowed so well with each scene that it evoked a sense of urgency and intensity. This is a phenomenal soundtrack. The movie starts to a ticking clock and it's only a matter of time until time runs out.There is very little dialogue in this movie but it isn't missed at all. This movie is an emotional power horse. I was genuinely moved a couple of times throughout it and it's one that will stay in my head for a long time.THE GOOD:Casting was perfect, the lesser known actors held their own weight against some of the veterans. The cinematography was fantastic, you really felt completely immersed in the movie. Hans Zimmer's score was Oscar-worthy. The movie will leave you on the edge of your seat throughout.THE BAD:The story line is not always linear which was confusing. Dialogue was sometimes hard to hear (but not necessary)_______Dunkirk is a fantastic movie, it's as simple as that. This should be the standard of movie that other directors should attain to achieve and here Nolan proves that he is one of the greatest directors of all time. The acting is superb and the entire movie is a treat for the eyes and ears. Don't miss out on seeing this in a cinema."
55," Nothing what you expect seeing the trailer
",The movie is so slow. Watching the trailer you would expect action scenes in the movie but there is almost none. Its all one side is attaching and the other is defending. You almost feel in the beginning the director is setting up the movie nice for some nice action to follow but midway through the movie you realize that nothing has happened and apparently nothing is going to happen. The movie never picks up. It just fails.
56," Bullshit !!
","My greatest fear while watching Nolan's new movie if that just because he has delivered back to back world-wide hits and seen as the most intelligent film-maker; critics and Nolan-fans are obliged to given 10/10 ratings even if the movie is very average or even bad.Dunkirk finally turned my fear into reality.The movie is simply plain boring. You don't feel attached to any character. I don't even care if they die. The Aerial shots featuring Tom hardy all seem repetitive. It was not ""immersive"", ""out of the world"" experience as many critics are saying.One critic wrote that there was pin-drop silence in theater. Yes, I agree but not because people are tense but perhaps they are sleeping.And dear western media, I know world needs a anti-war message right now but that doesn't mean you start giving rave reviews to such a pathetic movie. ALL PEOPLE know wars are bad. EVEN TRUMP knows that. EVEN Hitler knew that. We don't need a Nolan-movie to realize that.Half-hour into the movie and I was desperately waiting for it to get over. The only people who might like it are Britons because they have heard Dunkirk stories growing up and might relate to it. But for rest of the world, it is simple plain boring.Save your money and better watch Dark knight at home. Giving 1 star to bring some sanity back into the world. Although the movie might deserve 6/10."
57," I don't get it
","8.5 out of 10? NOT A CHANCE! I've always thought the IMDb ratings of various movies has been fairly spot on. No longer. This must be a 'PAID FOR' score! There is simply NO WAY people as a whole rated this movie THAT well, literally 0% chance.There is barley a movie to talk about here! Really, I can't even think of a good spoiler to tell you. Almost no dialog at all. No interesting characters whatsoever and no connection, you don't care at all if someone dies.Synchronicity flip flops all over the place for no good reason and is done poorly.The two redeeming features were the visuals and dramatic score... However, they do nothing to add value as you see right through them. Half a star each. After 20 mins I was ready to walkout due to boredom, I didn't, but I wish I had, because it gets no better... Credits were the best part, and even that was dull. Worst movie I have seen in years, and I recently watched Suicide Squad!"
58," Nolan fanboys are ruining reviews
",This movie has no character development at all people are just dying and you don't feel anything heck i don't even remember the main characters name and i saw the movie yesterday. People are just overreacting over a Nolan movie i started sleeping in the end. showing different perspective of characters was unnecessary and i saw the same scene again and again and sometimes knew what was going to happen to the character
59," Some of the reviews on here are fake/paid for
","Average Movie. Nolan has made a bore with interstellar and now this one. There is no story what so ever. Just soldiers on an island and soldiers in a plane. No plot or anything. Just two hours of soldiers on a beach. Since this movie is based on true events, how did the movie not have a plot? Instead of wasting your money on this go to google images and type in soldiers on a beach or soldiers in a plane. There I saved you 15 bucks. Loud and annoying music that wasn't needed. Hans Zimmer will try to use his music to have you thinking this movie will get intense but it never does.Another thing to note is most of the reviews on here for this movie are fake. I am constantly on this website and within the first 24 hours of the release of this movie there was already 100s of reviews posted. No other movie will have that many reviews that fast. Chistopher Nolan must of put some of the movie's budget into hiring people to write reviews. Planet of the apes came out a week before this and that only has 50,000 votes. This movie already has 115,000. Don't believe me? then check for yourself. Either half the audience had permission to watch the movie before anyone else or Nolan hired 100s of people for fake votes. Nolan is falling fast after his Batman Trilogy and he is an overrated director.1/10."
60," A monotonic and essentially dull film
","I saw the film at the BAFTA screening in NYC on 18-July-2017. I went with some trepidation as my father was at Dunkirk (and my mother's first husband was a RAF pilot who was shot down during WW2). Much to my surprise I found the film rather boring. The vast majority of the action is extremely repetitive. The British soldiers trying to escape are continually thwarted in some way by water, holes in the hulls of the boats, followed by lots of swimming, standing/sleeping on the beach waiting for the next chance to do the same thing. This frustration is inter-cut with two other main story lines (not really stories, and that is the problem). RAF Spitfires coming over the Channel to help. Finally, the heroes of the rescue, the plucky small boats from the south coast, sensibly represented by one craft with three crew. The reality is this is film which we know what happens, as this is a historical truth - many soldiers are rescued by the small boats (I ticked spoiler in case you do not know this!). The inter-cutting of the latter two story lines with the soldiers is filmed is a poor way. First from a technical point of view - the no continuity of lighting. I know the weather is highly changeable in the Channel but the same scene is at once brightly sunlit, then cloudy, then grey, then sunlit within seconds. This happened so much that I wonder if they did it deliberately. Secondly, there is a slight historical non-linear telling of the three stories as they intersect. The idea is obvious to see the story from different points of view. But why? It is not as if the view points generate fundamentally different moral perspectives. However the core problem is there is no real narrative in the film. We do not get a chance to care in any way about the characters. This truth in stark contrast to much much better films about war. The simplest example to point to is ""Mrs. Miniver"", a truly great film about war and, as it happens, Dunkirk. There are many reviewers giving this new film 10 with 'greatest war I have ever seen'. With no narrative and scene scene showing the same thing, it cannot be. Other great war films: ""The Grand Illusion"" and ""Apocalypse Now"" and ""Full Metal Jacket""."
61," No more than a good TV historical drama
","Is this a scam, or has the capacity to be critical been lost due to the very sensitive and emotional subject of the film. For me, it seems like a joke... How could this momentous and dramatic event in our recent history be presented with so little means and ambition ? From books and historical reports, the boarding was a mess, planes were all over the sky, there were myriads of boats and ships, the beach were left with tons of discarded equipment and weapons... We see none of that. How can you give an idea of what it must have been with only a few sparking clean vintage planes, one small war ship, 12 period fishing or leisure boats... How could so many shots taken on site incorporate 1960's, 70's or even 80's buildings, street furniture, modern container cranes... How can it be night for the scenes at sea, and day for what happens on the beach, in Dover, or in the air at the same time ? How long can a spitfire fly after it has run out of petrol, and still manage to fight... For those who like history, it is a waste of time. For those who like action and war scenes, it can be watched but will be a disappointment For those who seek emotions and a peek at humans behaviour during the event, there is reasonably good acting, in a good British drama tradition. I suggest to wait for one year and watch it on TV where this show belongs."
62," A shallow, pathetic attempt to depict a war scene
","This movie is so bad that we had to leave the cinema before it finished. It is merely a shallow attempt to depict the ""moment"" and nothing else.Content wise it offers no insight into the historic context, nothing. There's no dialogue, no story line whatsoever. If the intention of whoever made this movie is just to focus on the ""moment"", the state of being trapped of the soldiers then it also fails at that. For example, there were some efforts to portrait the mental state of the soldiers but dare I say it was an insult to those who fought in the war. What was being portrayed was mostly fear, the British soldiers depicted like a bunch of pathetic cowards, some was even tactically cheating to get on board, or accusing their fellow soldier of being a spy henceforth should get off the boat when it gets too heavy. Of course it's understandable to be desperate when you're in between life and death, but seriously what about other mentalities of the other hundred thousand soldiers? I cant help but thinking just play the opening scene of Saving Private Ryan on loop and you already have a much better result than this.Lookwise, it is so off putting. They said there were 400,000 soldiers trapped in Dunkirk but throughout the movie, you only saw a few boats and planes. Fair enough if they don't want to use screen effects to keep the realness, but then why alternate the colour of the whole movie to that omnipresent teal and orange look? It is too overused that some scenes don't even look real. The city in the opening scenes looks just fine and nowhere near like it's been at war, the high rank soldiers' uniform was flawless. The soldiers' faces look well fed and slept except some dirt on their face. In many scenes the composition of the frame is repeated in the same way: the camera was positioned below skyline so the frame was dominated by the sky and the beach, in the middle were silhouette of the soldiers, running across or. If this is the only way to portray the state a of being trapped then it shows a very very poor imagination. There's only so much left to criticize but I'll leave it here. For me this is the worst movie I've seen, also it's disrespectful to take such subject too lightly."
63," Need CGI & better music(or less)
","Music tempo was overpowering,the exhausted cowardly Brit trying to take a dump on the beach in the beginning of the movie with ear piercing somber music while his pants are down around his ankles was an ominous sign of things to come.The siege of Dunkirk (historically crammed with 300,000-400,000 vacating France with at least 10,000 on the sand at one time) seemed empty for lack of CGI & modern day reservist extras, Nolan went cheap & only hired 500 weekend warriors plus a dozen vehicles from a local car club. The civilian boat flotilla numbered a half dozen borrowed from the London Maritime Museum , CGI was needed badly...I cant believe I wrote that!Also scenes kept repeating themselves,like the movie was stuck in a loop ( going cheap again using one day aerial footage) Two Spitfires against two Messerschmitt Bf 109's escorting a bomber trying to make a bomb run on a tugboat,trawler or small freighters must have been reused 3-4 times. A lone war museum Heinkel He 111 lining up like a pregnant fat duck seems rather suicidal even with Mr. Bean manning the ack- ack or is WW2 now in the mythology/fantasy realm & Nolan must not be critiqued while misusing the last flyable HE111...probably as not to tear off the wings doing fancy maneuvers & upping the price tag of this Turkey to $200 Million . Plus that annoying music to camouflage the reuse of the footage was pure trickery & was getting blatant in the middle,even the lone CGI of the Stuka dive bombing the pier was reused many times with the music blasting in the foreground ...the same with the overturning Grey tugboat & swimming extras. Nolan's soldiers seemed hauntingly bored & extremely selfish (Putting to much of today's persona in a movie is not a good thing) The somber cowardly Lion characterizations made the British retreating army an army of fools with the French soldiers looking on with grim contempt as the Brits throw them under the bus ( E.U blow-back propaganda even infects Dunkirk) The antiquated ""Hold the Line!"" isn't what one hears from today's metrosexual British males & it reflects badly in how one perceives history in today's age.The Brits at Dunkirk were climbing over each other backs to get out ...that is how I perceive Nolan's Crayola Kindergarten scribbles to be & not Churchill's heroic histrionics with his empire on the line.Now since WW2 is now a distant memory with half of millennial iPhone humping narcissistic dolts rather clueless about anything concerning reality of historical placement, the story/movie did an awful job of explaining Dunkirk in the grand scheme of things . How many movie goers later Googled Wikipedia 'WW2' for an explanation of the Battle of France? ... not many if I know my fellow citizens. Nolan could have exchanged the Spitfires & Messerschmitts with the Millennial Falcon & X-Wing fighters I doubt any of today's citizens would have noticed nor cared.The Germans (Nazis) were shadow figures & the explanation of why Hitler paused in pushing the Brits into the sea was brushed off like so much sand... Adolf was a cunning diplomatic in the first year of the war & Churchill didn't bite the Carrot while Adolf halted the tanks letting the Brits vacate without being massacred mercilessly while awaiting England come to terms(But that is politically incorrect to question motives or think outside what is acceptable .. now back to Star Wars sequel #9)In conclusion the movie left me empty just like the sands of Dunkirk & any residue interest in 'WW2' was latter replaced by me digging through the closet looking for a dusty VHS copy of ""The Bridge to Far"" & reminiscing /realizing how far Hollywood has sunk & now sucks."
64," Quite a boring movie.
","I like war movies but I certainly didn't like this one. I feel the title is wrong because it's not so much about Dunkirk as its about some blokes who where there at the time.Sometimes it was hard to follow which moment in time is shown, because the movie abruptly cuts between three perspectives, therefore even showing some events twice. I hate this - Repetitive: Much scenes are identical or slightly different from another. Flight scenes was like WHO cares. Keeping out the Germans at the front-line is just as much a part of the story of Dunkirk and it would've given us a chance to actually see the enemy and get some awesome battle scenes.This movie is highly overrated, due to many biased Nolan fans and critics. I found it a very boring movie. The lack of an interesting plot or any interesting characters sadly wasn't compensated enough by the impressive audiovisuals. Rescue yourself from boredom and don't watch this movie!"
65," Let down
","I was expecting an epic film from all the hype and trailers. The number of evacuees didn't resemble the real images of the exodus that took place at Dunkirk. The numbers were thinned down for this film, maybe 10,000 heads compared to 390,000 missing from the screen. the film was purely smoke and mirrors when it came to the soundtrack, repetitive and leaving you expecting something was going to happen... I feel at utterly disappointed when it ended."
66," Save yourself the time: Just watch the trailer.
","*Please understand my rating is to compensate for the absurd amount of high ratings this film has gotten based on what I suppose is mere hype and anticipation. Because nothing in the film is more interesting than a silent WWII Documentary. I'm a huge fan of Nolan's work. I was excited to see his latest in Dunkirk. It may be the worst film he's made. And I think- if you place any director with half the notoriety on the bill... this movie gets a 7.0 rating at best. But. With Nolan's name attached, people decide it's a masterpiece before viewing it- and they wouldn't change their opinion after.There's no story. There's no character worth noting or caring about. There's no way to know what exactly is happening in many of the scenes due to the choppy editing... and every character seeming to be from the same clone-machine. (seriously- how many dark-haired guys with the same haircut can you squeeze into a single casting?)It's monotone, it's repetitive, it's essentially the same scene for 2 hours... and that'd be fine if something notable happens- but it never does. There's never a moment where you care. Never a moment that hits you in the form of empathy, suspense, etc. It's essentially like Nolan wanted to play with a few boats, planes, and do it at the beach... and he filmed it. It's been a long time since I've ever looked away from a screen and twiddled my thumbs wondering if something was going to happen or if it would just end if not... but I caught myself looking around the theater often. If I had a watch, I would have checked it. Spoilers:About the only notable moment that SHOULD draw some sort of reaction from audience members, is an extremely odd scuffle on board where a boy falls what looks to be 5ft to the floor below... and somehow loses his eyesight, somehow seems on his deathbed, and then dies... None of it makes sense, and the execution seems lazy and forced at the same time. The dad doesn't care. The guy responsible doesn't really care. The brother seems to care... for about 10 seconds. This part could have been cut from the film completely and wouldn't change anything. Much like a lot of the film. The film is essentially the trailer... over... and over.... and over again. Even Hans Zimmer, who is usually brilliant, completely misses the mark on this one. He's trying to force suspenseful sounds and noise where the film simply doesn't match up with action. How do you show the harshness of war while basically showing no one in pain? The closest thing we get to that is a few people drowning- but is flooding the real nightmare of war? You'd think so. It's truly the only fearful antagonist in this film. Water. And how many times can we watch soldiers stacked in bundles stare up at the sky, seemingly as bored as I was watching them, only to have a few water-balloon efficient bombs fall around them? The editing was all over the place. Continuity issues everywhere. Daylight one second- dawn the next, back to daylight... the cuts would randomly shift to another area of soldiers that look exactly like the previous... sometimes in repeat scenes (which wasn't consistent enough to read), sometimes in time shifts... and none of it is really justified other than Nolan stroking himself to the millions he suckered everyone for here. Possibly the most boring film I've seen in years. Incredibly disappointing effort by Nolan. OH! Positive: It's pretty. For about 30 minutes. Then you're pretty tired of watching the monotone screensaver'esque takes that never seem to vary, with no contrast."
67," The Worst Movie I Ever Saw, I Demand a Refund
","2 hours of nothingness. No characters, no story line. Just some planes flying in the sky, a some ships, and boats with occasionally scattered dialogue and a few bombs here and there. I actually feel the soldiers who served in Dunkirk was done a disservice by this film. It was truly that bad. I went because I saw it was a 9/10. This literally was the worst movie I ever saw. I could not wait to leave. I never write reviews but this film was deplorable in every sense. Did I expect it to be great? No. Good? Sorta. Fair. Definitely. Worst movie I ever saw? I didn't see that one coming. Not sure how you screw up a WW2 action movie about a cool battle but this Nolan cat apparently screwed the pooch on this one. Reviews must have been fake news / fake reviews lol. Omg. So terrible. Please folks save your money. As a matter of fact just give me half your money for the ticket and I'd be helping you out! Terrible, terrible, terrible."
68," I wish they evacuated me from the cinema
","With high expectations (it is a Christopher Nolan movie after all) we entered the cinema. With even higher disappointment, we left it. Dunkirk was two hours of the same over and over and over again building scene after scene with tense music only to leave the scene again without any climax. It was a confusing mix of scenes that failed to show the overall picture. If you like war movies, there are far better movies out there.The movie started out right and you're thrown right in the middle of the action and sitting on the edge of your seat you expect the movie to dive right into a great story, but then it stops, the climax halted, the story does not really develop and you're left with a feeling of missing something. The entire size of the evacuation (which should have been enormous) is completely missing. The dread of leaving in time because the Germans are breathing down their necks is absent and the scenes often jump to different time frames of the evacuation process. In fact the only Germans you see in person in the entire movie appear in the very end.The acting was OK and so were the different characters put in place: you have your heroes, each in their different way and you have your cowards, also each in their own different way. The cinematography was pretty well setup.Despite a huge potential in possibilities, Dunkirk did not convince me and I feel left stranded on the very beach they tried to escape from."
69," Its official. Movies are no longer about telling a story.
","While I found this movie visually great, it really has no story. It is a typical survival-story seen a thousand times before. No story + no interesting characters = boring. And only the visual is not enough (for me). People who are rating this movie with 10 stars, are either been dumbed down by studios in the last 20 yrs ... or the reviews have been bought by the studios for marketing reasons. It seems to me like Nolan wants to be a 'serious' film director now, and wants to get noticed by the academy. The superficial heroism of military and war by all these movies are really annoying and stupid. Seemed like Nolan got inspired by Mel Gibson, here. Good for Tom Hardy tough. I also would like to get a few million Dollars for watching left and right. Im disappointed on so many levels."
70," A Technical Achievement in Filmmaking Devoid of Any Depth or Emotion
","Make no mistake, from a technical perspective Dunkirk is an absolute achievement in filmmaking. Shot in portion on IMAX and completely on film, it's a visually gorgeous movie with breathtaking cinematography of dogfights in the sky and battles at sea. The sound effects and mix are possibly the best I've ever heard in a film! The gunshots are and loud, frightening, and realistic and every scene with a plane closing in sounds as if it i flying right above the audience making for an all the more immersive experience. And as always, Hans Zimmer delivers another excellent and powerful score that is one of the best I've heard in a film in quite sometime.Yet, Dunkirk makes the same mistake that many technical and visually impressive films do, it forgets to give us any reason to care about what's going on within it's craft. Nolan has made a film that is strictly about the event that took place and has chosen to tell it in an unconventional non-linear structure with three different areas of the event taking course over the span of a week, day, and hour. By within a few minutes dropping us into all the chaos unfolding and not stating the structure aside from brief ""One week...etc."" cards in the very start, it takes a little bit of time to fully grasp the way the story is being unfolded and difficult to get into during the first act with things moving at such a quick pace . The biggest issue with Dunkirk though is that there is nothing to get invested in. I'm debating whether to even say this movie has any characters because none of them have any depth, personality, or background. This is a film where we are suppose to be rooting for the survival of these people, yet aren't given any reason to care about them other than the fact they are soldiers fighting the enemy. As the film progressed, I found myself not wanting to see where the actual story would progress, but instead hoping that there would be something else I could appreciate visually or technically to keep me from losing complete interest.Another big issue is that Nolan desperately wants this to be a grim and horrific portrayal of war. However, this is difficult to do when the film is restricted to the boundaries of a PG-13 rating. This is the perfect example of a film that needed an R rating to fully be effective in what it was trying to do. Take films such as Saving Private Ryan or the recent Hacksaw Ridge in which the battle scenes become borderline horror films due to not just their suspense, but brutality and graphicness. Not that Dunkirk needed to be a Gibson gorefest, but it's portrayal of war feels all too tame and can't deliver on the level of suspense that's built up in the scenes proceeding it.That isn't to say the film isn't without tense scenes, one in particular where soldiers are hiding in a ship that is being shot at for target practicing is particularly nerve-wrecking as well as the climax and the ending are also very well done. As for the acting, there isn't a bad performance here, but with little dialogue or much to do other than look frightened the cast isn't given a lot to work with to show off much. Tom Hardy's role could have been played by any other actor and it wouldn't have changed a thing which can be said for most of the cast here.For a film that has openly taken pride in how experimental, unique, and going against what is norm in Hollywood, Dunkirk ends up being exactly what Nolan has been criticizing. It's a complete exercise in spectacle that's trying to get a pass with it's unique style and filmmaking techniques to excuse it's lack of depth and emotional core. I can appreciate Nolan for taking a different approach to a war film and it certainly showcases his talent as a director, but just because it's different doesn't automatically make it good and without any real depth, characterization, or emotion only further provides evidence of his weakness as a writer. If the film had been trimmed down to 30-40 minutes and released as an IMAX feature it would have been much more impressive, but the film itself is an empty exercise in technical achievement that's in it's own way a new breed of cynical filmmaking."
71," An Insult To Those That Served.
","Reviews claiming this movie ""greatest WW2 movie"" are an absolute nonsense. ""Dunkirk"" barely qualifies for the genre. * There is zero land combat between Allied and German forces portrayed in the movie. There is no depiction of tanks, artillery or infantry engaged in hostilities on land. There is a dozen aircraft and ships from the era and what looks like a cast of a few hundred. The movie does not deserve its title. It is in fact an insult to the memory of ""Dunkirk"", the professional British Soldier, Seaman and Airman, the civilian and merchant crews of the rescuing flotilla, the population of Dunkirk - to all those souls from both sides of the conflict present at Dunkirk late May early June 1940. * The 2 main characters are cowards. There is a repelling creepiness about their relationship. They don't look or act like professional British soldiers orderly holding on for evacuation rather they act like a pair of modern gender fluid sis males desperately trying to return to their safe space. This is the central story and it is about these 2 cowards deserting their post and using every trick they can think of to push in front of everyone else including the wounded to get aboard a ship home to safety. They even throw their rifles away not long into the movie the gutless scum. They deserved a court-martial sentence to be shot for the selfish, cowardly desertion of their comrades. If the Allied soldiers had acted this disgracefully the defense and evacuation of Dunkirk could never have taken place and the war lost. * A ""shell shocked"" soldier is rescued at sea by a civilian boat crewed by a middle aged gent and two teenage boys. This soldier flies into a rage demanding the boat steer immediately to England and not onto Dunkirk to rescue more men. In this rage he pushes one of the boys down a hatch to a lower deck where the boy strikes his head and dies thus committing murder. However, on return to England he is metaphorically slapped on the back and told ""not to worry old chap you are shell shocked so killing innocent people is totally expected of you. Don't you worry yourself we will lie to the authorities and the boys family so you never face justice. Now off you go and have some fun.""* The disgraceful behavior of cowards and and the unlikely, unpleasant murder of a boy are deemed more worthy to depict than the inspiring stories of heroic courage and mateship displayed by the highly trained and experienced professional soldiers these men were. Brave men on the outer defenses and town fought desperately to ensure their comrades safe evacuation. These men knew they faced two possible outcomes - death or capture for the wars duration. The soldiers evacuated would have swapped places with their mates defending the beach without a thought. The movie should be about their valor not the shameful cowardice of deserters or the unlikely actions of a soldier claiming ""shell shock"".This is perhaps the most over hyped disgrace of a movie I have seen. It is a shameful disservice to the men that fought at Dunkirk and the brave men in tiny boats that came to their rescue."
72," Saving Private Ryan it's not!
","It's amazing how hype, a vastly overrated reputation, and a jackhammer sound score can mesmerize some naive souls into believing this wretched exercise is some kind of masterpiece of avant-garde filmmaking. If Saving Private Ryan rates A+, Dunkirk rates a D–.The stage is set with a clumsy repetition of introductory titles (rather than briefly showing the lead-up to Dunkirk) before jumping into one of the main ""character's"" retreat to the beaches. I say ""character"" because, like the others, this guy is a cipher — there is ZERO characterization in this film. All are about wooden as the masts on the private yachts — might as well be animatron mannequins populating a haphazard stitching of action sequences devoid of any narrative structure (avant-garde or otherwise). Any halfwit with a budget and some CGI can stage engrossing battle scenes these days, but Nolan's random montage generates no real suspense — this is masked over with a relentless, buzzsaw sound score designed to get your blood up and compensate for the film's glaring faults — it doesn't, unless you're a Brave New World drone conditioned by the Feelies.Implausible motivation: the shell-shocked soldier rescued by the private yacht revolts against going to Dunkirk, actually killing one of the young crewmembers and then we cut to yet another redundant Spitfire/Heinkel/Messerschmitt engagement. Back on the yacht, what has happened? Has the mutinous soldier commandered the yacht? Are the captain and his son outraged by the murder? NO! There's nothing here — no requisite emotion, no resolution to this ""drama,"" nothing but close-ups of deadpan faces, another problem with this turkey — like the old 70mm epics (How the West Was Won), IMAX is not the medium for close-ups, yet Nolan gives an over abundance of 100-meter ECUs! And what little dialogue exists in the film is lame, mumbled and almost unintelligible.Perhaps worst of all is how he bungled the dramatic rescue by a flotilla of private boaters — the core of this story. We could have had Churchill's appeal, the humble yeomen assembling on the docks with a mixture of trepidation and courage — instead, the boats suddenly appear all at once, deus ex machina, at the beaches, with no depiction of the rescue at all.I suffered through Dark Knight Rises and the 3-hour torture fest Interstellar (the most ""intelligent sci-fi film since 2001: Space Odyssey"" NOT!), and I will never endure another Nolan mish-mash again! They say he began making films at age 7 — he is still a callow, indulgent juvenile with a camera, big bucks and dismal mastery of cinematic art. I pity the poor souls who misconstrue his efforts as some kind daring Orson Wells/Maya Derren innovation, but there's no accounting for masochism."
73," Incredibly flat presentation
","The first thing I heard about this film was some moronic SJW uproar about ""lack of diversity"" aka too many white people in the film and not enough women or people of color. The leftist lunacy never ends. This made me want to support the film even more, so I rushed out and watched it. Sadly, I found the film incredibly flat, devoid of much power amid all the amazing scenes, cinematography and effects. It seemed to lack...direction, or perhaps it was bad editing, but unlike other recent war flicks like Hacksaw Ridge (which was great save the meaningless love angle) Dunkirk was just not very compelling. It was like watching a series of scenes which looked great but had no cohesion as a complete film. Also, the soundtrack was freaking horrible. More annoying than suspense building, the repetition of the ""music"" did nothing but make those scenes less dramatic."
74," A Decent Sunday Afternoon Movie Best Watched At Home.
","Firstly, i want to say i enjoyed the film, nothing amazing like the critics and Christopher Nolan fans have made out but i think he achieved what he set out to do, with all the parameters he set himself regards to the differences with actual Dunkirk history and the filmmaking style he wanted to use.It certainly isn't one of the greatest war films ever made, far from it but it is a decent experiment in filmmaking, if your into that kind of thing.Me and my friend both thought it was like a good film you watch at home on a Sunday afternoon. And having watched it on the big screen i would say that thats the best way to fully enjoy it too, at home, which i would rather have seen it at. You'll understand when you see it, its just one of those films.If you watch this in Imax like i did, make sure you take a tissue because the sound becomes unbearably loud after a little while and you may need to plug your ears up, especially when the aircraft segments start and with the bigger explosions abit later on. Even with tissues in ears its pretty loud too but its nicely bearable.So if you do go and watch it at the cinema then i wholeheartedly recommend watching it in the standard 2D screens, mainly because of the unbearably loud volume and bassy sounds in Imax, mixed with the other film soundtrack noises makes everything sound muffled. And also because it isn't such the big visual spectacle as they've lead us to believe. Nolans previous films and those of say Ridley Scott or Peter Jackson have given more scope and reason to watch their films in an Imax screen.Overall though, i found the film enjoyable, JUST above average. It plods along nicely for a 95 minute feature, with 10 minutes of end credits also. There isn't a dull moment in this from my perspective. Nolan does make you feel sorry for the characters he wants you to feel sorry for, but for a war film it isn't a greatly emotional one. I don't understand why its been given such high ratings as the visuals, sound, story, character development and overall feel don't warrant such grand praise. I can understand why half the audience have really disliked it for the above reasons also, as there was no storyline and there's barely a character for the audience to attach themselves to. Plus there's a lot of difference in regards to the sheer numbers of aircraft's, boats and people not present here. I did feel the grandness of the peril these boys were actually in really missing because of this scaling down from Nolan, which was his conscious choice to leave out. I have to admit that adding CGI here and there really would have given this moment of history a more realistic vision of it's devastating scale.I expected to see really amazing choreographed air combat sequences too but they were just OK, they did the job but nothing spectacular or exciting. There have been way better and breathtaking aircraft combat scenes from most other films, war or sci-fi!If you didn't know Christopher Nolan's intentions in his film as i've briefly alluded to above and are expecting to see an epic masterpiece of a war movie in the vein of films by directors like Stanley Kubrick, Michael Cimino, Brian De Palma, Oliver Stone, Ridley Scott, Francis Ford Coppola, Steven Spielberg or Mel Gibson, where the visuals mesh breathtakingly with story, characters and emotions then you may be disappointed with Dunkirk. Dunkirk feels more like a brief and confined moment of an evacuation, with small scale pockets of peril at its heart, and knowing that will help you appreciate this better, hopefully, but by how much i don't know, for me its a 6/10, just above average.It's definitely not on the scale the critics and fanboys have sold it on, for a general audience! Even though i enjoyed it i still don't see how such high ratings are being thrown at this. And its a shame the film doesn't convey the epic grand scale feeling of terror that history has told us."
75," Dunturd - Hyped up mediocre pretentious war film - watch it on netflix
","Gushing reviews and hype led me to believe this was going to be an amazing war film. So many people compared Dunkirk very, very favourably to 'saving private ryan'. Many rave reviews 10/10 'the best war film ever'& 'Nolan masterpiece' etc.First things first, this film bears absolutely no comparison to 'saving private ryan'. Dunkirk is not fit to be mentioned in the same breath as Spielbergs masterpiece.Saving Private Ryan is deservedly a classic war film that can be watched many times.Dunkirk is (at best) mediocre. Watch once, unremarkable and quickly forgotten, vastly overrated and over-hyped. We went expecting greatness, (which we were led to believe was this film) and left, as I heard a fellow member of the audience state on leaving, ""thats 2 hours I won't get back again"".It's yet another of those Hollywood offerings, a clapped out ford escort disguised under a 'ferrari body kit'. From outside it looks good, but once you get in and drive, it's a clapped out ford escort.Enough of my disappointment:- The film shows the British/French military disaster of Dunkirk, where the British expeditionary force and thousands of French troops had retreated to Dunkirk, as conquering German armies swept across France using 'Blitzkreig' tactics.The only hope for those at Dunkirk was evacuation by sea or face annihalation.The film attempts to tell the story through the eyes of a Spitfire Pilot (Tom Hardy) A group of British tommies attempting to escape from Dunkirk (including Harry Stiles who gave a creditable performance) and civilian small boat skipper (Mark Rylance) who is sailing over as one of 'the little ships' to rescue the army.The mistake is trying to cram to many viewpoints, with a slightly different time line, into too short a film (1hr 46mins) Also having characters you actually don't care much about. The 1958 film Dunkirk did a much better job on both aspects and was over 30 minutes longer. Visually it's good, (back to the Ferrari body shell) but you don't get any empathy for the characters, particularly the soldiers, who should be the key to the story (being about the evacuation from Dunkirk) The film spends far too long with Tom Hardy, flying his remarkable spitfire, it flies on and on with limitless ammo. He shoots down several fighters, a bomber, and (amazingly) even a stuka whilst his plane is gliding (having run out of fuel) The film title is 'Dunkirk' not 'Spitfire Battles' so detracts from the main story - which surely is about the evacuation of Dunkirk. Mark Rylance is good as the boat skipper with his son plus a 17 year old boy as crewman.However, its a bit Uuh? as he just sails off with his boat as the RN is trying to put naval crews on board, and remarkably knows exactly where he has to go and why. In reality the RN briefed the small boats and gave them routes to skirt minefields etc. On route Rylance picks up Cillian Murphy sitting atop a mostly submerged ship hull. Murphy is a bit 'shell shocked'.On realising he is being taken back to Dunkirk, in a scuffle with the skipper to turn around the boat, the 17 year old is accidentally fatally injured. Pointless sub story compared to the main 'event' (Dunkirk evacuation) Another uuh! moment.The film tries to be 'clever' (but doesn't pull it off) entwining all three story lines to meet at the same event. When Hardy attacks the bomber, attacking the minesweeper, that the soldiers are trying to swim to from their sinking fishing boat and Rylance rescues them. The British soldiers, who the film follows, are remarkably cowardly. Bearing mind the Britsh Expeditionary Force, although small, was a professional army. Not conscripts.I felt nothing for the soldier characters, other than a mild contempt for being so cowardly, no attempt to find their units, just run for the ships, by any means.The film has several good actors, which seemed remarkably wasted, murphy as battle fatigued coward !Brannagh as some senior naval officer on the pier - more of a cameo Hardy was convincing as a pilot but rather detracted from the evacuation story. In many respects, this film is a glib, colour version of a disastrous part of our military history and a remarkable evacuation.I did get a lump in the throat at the sight of the 'little ships' but only about 7 were shown, and it was almost a 'by the way' scene, as if not important.In reality 800 or so, civilian small vessels, of all shapes and sizes, from paddle steamers to river launches, bravely sailed across to rescue the army. However, you never get the scale of the event nor feel any empathy, let alone sympathy, for the characters. This director is a poor scriptwriter for an historic event within living memory. He should stick to science fiction stories. The sound was mostly loud dirge 'music' that did nothing for me.Whats the difference between a bucket of faeces and the film Dunkirk 2017 ? The bucket!4.5/10p.s. I nearly laughed out loud at the end. On a surprisingly modern train in blighty, the soldiers wondered what people would think of them? Bearing in mind how they had jumped every queue and used every deception to save their skins. I think 'cowards' would be appropriate."
76," Gonna take a shot at reviewing this (no pun intended)
","I'll start with the good. Nolan's refusal to use sets creates a wonderful atmosphere. I really felt like I was there on the beach with them, I felt the gloom and the cold and the mist and the enclosed spaces. The contrasting sunset on the sea with the catastrophe of war made me feel deeply for the humans who experienced this. I enjoyed the humanity in the beginning, the men searching for water and trying to poop anywhere possible. However, my red flag went up at the informative slides at the beginning. In one swift move, any chance of mystery and allure was crushed. Obviously this is a historical event so major spoilers aren't really possible. But, this isn't a documentary. Let the stories unfold. Give us information in text if necessary, but omit the end outcome. ""The men waited for a miracle.""Okay. So, we now know this movie is about them getting this miracle. Done. We already knew that. Don't tell us, show us. I personally am not a fan of the way Christopher Nolan directs. In this movie as well as Batman, the audience is left visually lost. There are no point of references, no connected images that help us make heads or tails of exactly what's happening. This movie is unnecessarily convoluted. It took me awhile to understand that we are cutting between three different time lines. This is a fantastic tactic, if done with intention. In Dunkirk, it was all just... kind of happening. The film manipulates you by using incredibly loud sounds, which didn't bother me at first because I felt like I was really there with them, but when the film showed itself to be lacking in other ways, I felt fooled by the cheap trick. I found a lot of the film to be simply inaudible. I dreaded the conversations between the commander and the colonel. For me it went ""blah blah blah, home"" ""blah blah blah, home"" ""blah blah blah, civilians"" At one point we even discovered that our stowaway friend was French. I thought it was more of an indiscernible English accent, but my French friend who I saw the movie with filled me in afterwards, and he only knew what happened because he speaks French. Is that a huge negative? Not necessarily. But it felt like I was being left out. There's two types of movies. There's a movie that takes you into it, effortlessly. It isn't something you are watching but something you are apart of. The other type of movie is one that you actively need to watch. You could take it or leave it. It doesn't command your attention. The main event of this movie was people getting off ships, people getting back on ships, people getting off ships, people getting back on ships. There was no through-line to look to for guidance. It didn't highlight the story of Dunkirk from any specific or interesting angle. Like I said before, it just kind of happened. The point of this movie is that it happened. Which, okay, that's fine. But, on top of that, key ingredients of the actual event were missing!The real event included French and Candian and Belgian troops all evacuating over a weeks time, with the small boats. It wasn't suddenly one easy trip the way this movie presents it to be. And while this was happening, British and French men had to stay behind and fight in order to let the others escape. In addition to that, we didn't once see a man on the other side, narrowing and dehumanizing this story. It's oddly convenient that everyone cheered with excitement when the small boats showed up, considering everyone who had gone out into the sea for the past week had been getting slaughtered. Seems less like real men experiencing this in real time, and more like a Hollywood director knowing the end of this story. This part, seemingly the main event of Dunkirk was completely glossed over. Seeing the civilians reach land, seeing the interactions between them and the soldiers, seeing the gratitude and stress and exhaustion is essential. And we got none of it. If your one goal in making a movie is to tell it how it is, at least tell it how it is."
77," Utterly underwhelming as a piece of storytelling and a piece of entertainment
","I cannot tell you how disappointed I was with this film, being a fan of about everything Christopher Nolan does.There were 2 ways the story of Dunkirk could be told: 1.An epic which showed broadly the scale of the operation, the death toll and the effect on the war.2. Follow a group of characters and experience the story through their eyes as they go through it all.It attempts the latter and falls short in a big way. Paper thin characters across the board left me completely disinterested in the story. Even Tom Hardy failed to evoke an emotion. What were his character traits? I couldn't name one except the obvious bravery.The effects are seamless, I will give it that, but the quantities of everything are somewhat baffling. I think I saw less than 10 aircraft in the whole movie, yet dive bombing is largely the focus of the film. Did they run out of budget?I think I watched a different film to the other reviewers."
78," This movie is not about Dunkirk
","If you are interested in or have knowledge of World War II history, don't go to see this movie. If you have family in the armed forces, and/ or like 'saving private Ryan', similarly avoid this movie. It will annoy you, infuriate you, bore you. It does not inform or shape your understanding of what happened at Dunkirk. It is gratuitous labelling. The story is about something else, something I can't be bothered considering, something 'arty', something glorifying cowardice when there are soldiers of caliber all around. I went to see a movie about the astonishing evacuation at Dunkirk. I got something else that was cheap and nasty and insulting."
79," Dullwork should be the ideal title for this one
","I am still trying to pick up the pieces of my brain after watching this so called 'epic movie ever' with so many dumb accolades! I am still at a loss to figure out what the heck Nolan was trying to tell us? Is it the 'heroic work' of allied troops; which actually to me, were lamely waiting for their death? Or was it about just one single heroic job of a RAF pilot or two? Or just about a story of some crap Nazi pilots, all of whom just got shot by one or two RAF planes who were running even without a drop of fuel? Some pilots can kill even when they are gliding so I guess miracles happen, doesn't it?? And the pain of racing your brain in between millions of scenes just nearly assassinate you! Why did Nolan think he was creating climax by swapping a soup of 3 main background scenes over and over, so quickly, till the end where that juggling-in-between scene job exhausts you to near death? It totally kills the smooth flow of any story telling if there was any! I don't have anything to comment about acting because there was no acting of any significance. All the actors were like monuments. And what was that guy Fionn was doing as Tommy, I don't have heck of an idea! There was nothing to comment about music either which I did fairly OK with my strong ear plugs. Editing was the mantra for Nolan it seems and probably is much better than the director's job I must say.In short, just waste few dollars and hours and get a boring dull story with an endless cacophony!"
80," A Strange Mixture of Emotion and Noise
","As the daughter of a man who fought in WW2, together with all other male relatives in our family, I was anxious to see this film which should have been both an emotional and educational experience. Sadly for us it was a disappointment and left us wondering exactly why the film is called ""Dunkirk"".There are good performances and some emotional scenes, particularly at the beginning of the film. But the time line was so confusing and the beach was so empty considering that there were well over 300,000 men awaiting evacuation. And where were the 800+ small boats which sailed back and forward over a period of 8 days and, together with the larger British destroyers and merchant ships, saved almost 340,000 soldiers. We saw endless air battles which were beautifully filmed but weren't exciting or effective.Finally the music - Hans Zimmer is a wonderful composer of film music and his creation for this film was effective. But why so loud and so much? It was almost impossible to hear some of the text and I'm astonished that a director of the caliber of Nolan thought that this would add to the tension. Sometimes silence says far more than the constant background of very loud music.I presume that many of these things won't bother a younger audience but I believe that the story of Dunkirk deserved to be more accurate. The most annoying thing was the fact that in the brief introduction to the film, where there is an explanation as to the situation of the trapped soldiers, the enemy surrounding the soldiers is not named - they are just 'the enemy'. What happened to naming them as the German Army or the Nazi Army?"
81," Wish I had missed this one
","I've just come from seeing Dunkirk, and I would say that it would have been no colossal loss not seeing it. I nearly left on account of the music several times. It was dragging, tense, and full of disharmony throughout nearly the entire movie. If you've no seen it yet, I would suggest that it's not worth the price of admission. There's my 2¢."
82," Disappointed!
","The evacuation of Dunkirk was a miracle. I had wondered what this film would have to say about it that hasn't been shown before. The beach scenes are portrayed as lines of soldiers standing quietly. There are no non-coms screaming orders or keeping order. Everyone is acting like they are waiting for afternoon tea. Air battles: repetitive. The same yellow-nosed Bf-109 gets shot down several times. (Yawn!) And the timing of the air scenes is simply unbelievable. In an effort to create suspense a Heinkel 111 takes nearly five minutes to get close enough to be shot down by a Spit. This is despite closing speeds in excess of 500 mph. Just not believable. Other efforts to create suspense are simply contrivances. The crowning disappointment is the main kick: the miracle of Dunkirk was the response of hundreds upon hundreds of small boat owners, ship owners, ferry crews....ordinary Britons who risked their lives to get anything that floats across the channel to rescue the troops. This is given short shrift, not only in following only one boat, but in so few boats actually being in the film. I don't understand the hype this film has been given. Wait for it to come out on DVD, then don't bother to see it."
83," Worst WWII movie i have yet seen.
","It was difficult to give this film such a high rating but it did have certain good qualities. The acting was good and the uniforms looked real. having said these good things, let me get to the list of bad:DO NOT see this movie if you are a fan of history. The historical inaccuracies will drive you insane. Dunkirk was one of the turning points of the war. It was because the Brits were able to save their army that Germany did not invade. Germany instead decided to turn on Russia and this eventually led to their demise. This great WWII battle was completely underrepresented in this film. There were less than ten total planes in the movie, 20 or less ships, and MAYBE 500 actors. This was not enough. I went in expecting the same level of action as the movie Pearl Harbor, but what i saw was... something less. DO NOT see this movie if you like a story line or plot. There was no plot to this movie at all, and the events in the movie are not even represented in a linear time line. DO NOT see this movie if you like to identify with characters. You will not care much about the characters because there is very little dialogue and no way for you to learn about them. DO NOT see this movie if you are expecting action. There were only a couple ""dog fights"" which consisted of one plane flying behind another with zero intensity.DO NOT see this movie if you have been in the military. Obviously Nolan had nobody on set that knew anything about the military because from the opening sequence there were problems. For example, the movie opens with a few Brits lollygagging in an area with Germans close enough to shoot at them. It is here we see that apparently none of the Brits had their weapons loaded. Also it should be noted that at no point is there any fighting of any kind in the city of Dunkirk. They never show the men holding the line for this evacuation. There were no German artillery barrages. Also it needs to be said, planes would not have dropped bombs on men in the sand when there were ships and docks right there. They would have strafed them in the sand. Overall i cannot say how completely disappointed i was with this film. I do not think i will ever see another war film from Nolan."
84," Dunkirk Should be a Flop If There is Any Justice in This World
","I really liked Inception. I think that Christopher Nolan is a genius. But his latest film, Dunkirk, is a turkey. This is one of the worst films I've ever seen. I'm not just saying that because I sat there and nit-picked the military hardware and special effects and found them lacking. I'm saying it because the movie was just plain bad.I will point out that I'm glad that some of my favorite actors got some work and were paid ""big picture"" money to work on this. It's nice to see some really fine actors get paid. That's the only good thing I can think of to say. So let's get started on the bad stuff.Historical accuracy? Yeah, I'm a war nerd (tm) and I study war. I did notice a few ""errors"" here and there but WHO CARES? The errors in historical baloney such as ships or planes or whatever just fade into nothingness compared to colossal error of making a movie about Dunkirk in which the blitzkrieg is missing. Blitzkrieg may have been real, or may have been some kind of historical fallacy, but it's a thing. It has to be in a movie about flippin' Dunkirk or nobody knows what's going on.This movie desperately needed a tiny touch of something to explain how all those soldiers ended up on the beach. A hint. Something. You just don't show ""lots of guys on the beach"" and not expect somebody to ask ""what's this?""The blitzkrieg was missing. So were the Germans. No Germans. Just ""the enemy"" said in such a ""suitable for television"" manner as to cause anyone's ears to prick up. ""What did they not say? They censored the word 'Germans?' What??""Yes. Dunkirk is a movie that fails to identify ""the enemy"" as The Third Reich. I'm calling bullshit on that. This is just embarrassing. No mention of Germans or Huns or Jerries or Heinies or Boche. No nothing.The word is ""stupid.""It gets worse.The film opens with a stunning display of poor soldiering by a British Tommy. He comes under fire so he stands up in a hot environment and then, failing to get rightfully shot, he throws down his rifle and runs for the rear. I wanted to shoot him myself but the realities of modern cinema make shooting characters on the screen pointless.We are then treated to some of the worst aerial footage in memory. Spitfires and Messerschmitts shoot each other. There is a discussion about saving ships and planes for The Battle of Britain. It's a short discussion. There is another short discussion about The Battle of France. Nobody cares, especially the people on screen. It's all very abstract, cold and meaningless.But never fear, we're treated to the inevitable result of shooting and bombing and killing. A man is rescued from a sunken ship, then, in a fit of dementia, he kills a teenage boy. Obviously that's what happens in war. Men go mad and kill boys.Well, if you want to believe that--go ahead. Just don't expect me to join you. I'm sure that a few British soldiers behaved badly during the Dunkirk battle. But that's not the story here. The fact that the vast majority of them did not behave badly is the story. Get it straight.They made a good movie about Dunkirk. It was called Mrs. Miniver. Watch that instead. Maybe the British back then were just too stiff and proper to be believable to us now. But that's not something that was wrong with them then, it's a symptom of what's wrong with us now.Addendum: It took me a couple of days to find the movie that sounds like this one. Yes, I hated the score by Hans Zimmer almost as much as the movie itself, because it was so distracting to try to remember ""where have I heard this before?"" Well, I heard the music in the 1984 film ""The Bounty"" by Vangelis. THAT music sounds so much like the music in this film that if I were Vangelis, I'd lawyer up.So yes, even the music sucked (I can hardly believe it). Hans Zimmer let me down."
85," Nolan over his head. Lost between Saving Private Ryan and Memento
","The movie has so much potential in the first 10 minutes but then it falls apart. While Nolan is trying to decide if the movie wants to be Saving Private Ryan or another Memento, he forgets to build any characters or narrative that anyone can care about. What a shame given the cast he had at his hand. He was just unable to direct them or bring together anything redeeming or with any level of depth. Aside from the first 10 minutes, there are some beautiful cinematography. However, the scenes are shot on different days. One sunny and the other overcast. So the beautiful visuals are unable to sustain any type of mood across the length of the movie. At the end, it's clear the story was too ambitious for Nolan and he was just unable to put it together."
86," The most overrated movie ever
","I went to this movies with very high expectations and I was really disappointed. I am not sure what went wrong but I guess it was supposed to convey the magnitude of the events as well as tie the spectator emotionally, sadly it failed miserably in both. The only one i felt for was the french soldier, meanwhile all other actors were just bland and i couldn't care less for. Moreover the movie couldn't at all convey the magnitude of the event (only a word at the end of the Movie we save 300,000) All i can say is that was painfully boring. The music was annoying most of the time. It was just bad storytelling and I really cant understand how can anybody like this."
87," The worst movie of the year
","And the worst movie of the year goes to... Dunkirk! This was absolutely the most horrible movie I've ever watched in a long time. The music or noise (from Hans Zimmer) was terrible and loud which was very surprising. The dialogue or the lack thereof was, well... pretty much non-existent. The story was... Oh there was actually a story? I must have missed that. Anyway, this is the last time I listen to IMDb which gave the movie a rating of 8.6/10. Morality of this post? The world is full of idiots who can't fricking rate a movie"
88," Terrible
","Really really poor movie, bad acting, gratingly bad music (if you can call it that), no character story and really badly made with zero respect for the history. Modern scenes/items throughout (e.g., modern container terminal in backgrounds, modern fenders on the boats) a warship at anchor getting torpedoed, who anchors a ship in the middle of a battle? A spitfire with no fuel flying faster than it did when the engine was running then turning around to make one more kill before landing, with no engine running! A group of soldiers threatening to throw off a french guy overboard to lighten the load on their boat so it would float when its chest deep in water sinking. One minute the sea is calm and sunny, next minute its windy and overcast. Boats pro-porting to be evacuating 300,000 soldiers leaving the beach/port half empty, the beach scenes showing less than 5,000 soldiers lined up waiting to leave, where were all the others? Also neatly lined up ready to be shot at by panes and artillery. Could they not afford enough extras?Director and writers did not show anything of the history or characters, they disrespected the viewer by thinking the type of events like the above were to be believed, just a horrible movie all roundDon't bother watching even when it is on TVCant believe the reviews are positive at all. Go compare it to well made classic war movies and then come back and give this one a 1 star like it deserves.Better examples include Private Ryan, Gallipoli, The Longest Day, Bridge too far, etc"
89," Poor
",One of the poorest quality movies I've seen in years hard to watch disjointed. Poorly directed and badly composed hardly any linear continuityI had trouble finishing the whole film. Why people praise this is beyond me when there have been so many better wartime dramasJust two examples say - compared to films like The Train with Burt Lancaster or Saving Private Ryan this film would put audiences to sleep.
90," Looking forward to the remake; by another writer/director
","The movie was a huge disappointment.Here's some of the things that have been said about this movie - none of them are true:""A technical masterpiece"" ""An absolutely outstanding depiction"" ""A must See"" ""Best movie Of summer 2017"" ""Best war film ever made"" ""A must see film"" ""Dunkirk is an authentic..."" ""Dunkirk is the most realistic war-movie ever made""If I had the time, for my own personal viewing I would re-work this movie by first re-ordering the overlapping and out of sequence scenes, and then kill the entire droning musical score (obviously it would have to be on a track that I can turn off). Just these simple changes would make it a far better watch. To fine tune the movie further, I would shorten the many long pointless pauses, when people in real life would either do or say something.The evacuation from Dunkirk was of course a real event, a significant element of which was the hundreds of small vessels and regular folk who took to the sea to being their boys back home – all of that hardly came through, nor did the true seriousness of the situation on the beaches and in the town, and the fighting that was going on in an attempt to slow the approaching army down.All in all, I think this movie is a p-poor-job. I wish I'd waited until it was on Netflix - I could have at least been editing some of my photos at the same time.Do I think you should watch this at the movie theatre: No!"
91," Definitely not the film of the year
","Disappointed - script and acting were poor - also considering that 800 vessels and 16 RAF squadrons were involved in rescuing the troops, the depiction of just a handful of boats and planes didn't portray the enormity of what happened - the constant switching between air, land and sea did not help at all. The portrayal of soldiers using devious & callous means to get a 'lift home' was not typical of the hundreds of brave men who waded into water for many hours to be ferried by small boats to the larger destroyers. And why show one rescued soldier accidentally killing a 16yr old boy - this was not what Dunkirk was all about. The film was boring and left me annoyed that reality was ruined by half baked fiction"
92," Worst Nolan movie so far
","I expected much from this movie, but got nothing. Besides nice effects and good music film is below average. First, it is inaccurate, because Hitler let British troops get away, it was not their effort, but just the mercy of the Nazis. Second, story is very weak, in few words you have British&French forces pinned down by the shore and few boats rescuing them. Caracthers are undeveloped, for example Tom Hardy speaks maybe 10 lines and he is wearing mask all the time. Harry Styles is actually good. There are few acts of so called 'bravery' and after that film ends.By far, worst movie from Nolan to date. Big mess, weak story, ignoring historical facts. 4/10 and I am generous."
93," Dunkirk – I want my money back!
","Dunkirk – I want my money back!No back story. No character development. Almost no dialogue. Film makes no effort in getting you to care about these characters. Besides knowing your history, you really don't have any reason to love the good guys or hate the bad guys.There is a constant ticking sound that plays like a time bomb about to go off. Like in many movies the last 10 seconds. Except here, it played for what seemed like 25 minutes straight. I began to wonder if I'd have been better off being one of the extra's that got killed off in the opening scenes.I'm sure this will be hailed as some sort of masterpiece for its visual and sounds which aren't bad save for the stupid ticking time bomb.But the music is so over down. The impending doom that we know from a Jaws movie or any horror flick is constant throughout most of the film. Done to such a point you begin to question if there is going to be an actual story here or are we just going to witness a battle more in a documentary fashion.This reminded me of the first half of 2001 a space odyssey. No story. More of an opera than a movie. But at least 2001 started to tell a story of actual characters.This is totally for the artsy fartsy type. They should add a new rating for this type of movie. Rated AFB. Artsy Fartsy B!@#$#it. I hated it. A waste of time and I want my money back. I'm sure it'll win the Oscar for Best Picture as it's totally made for those AFB types that vote on who wins.Normal everyday people should avoid. You'll hate it."
94," Bleak and hopeless.
","If you enjoyed the last twenty minutes of Titanic, then this film is for you. If you liked the bleak vision of humanity that Christopher Nolan portrayed in The Dark Knight Rises, you might like the atmosphere of this film. If you want a generic war-is-hell and survival is matter of chance film, you may well appreciate this.If you remember Dunkirk as a victory snatched from the jaws of defeat; as a near-miracle when for a full day a storm grounded the German air force in Flankers while the Channel was as calm as a millpond; as a day when sixty German planes attacked four hundred men on the beach and inflicted no casualties; as a time when men were buried hastily but with military honours rather than being allowed to lie dead on the beach; then this film does a huge disservice to the truth. Finally a note on accuracy. The film may look right but it is missing almost any detail that might bring hope into the situation. The images may be accurate; the atmosphere is more appropriate for a film about a concentration camp."
95," When Nolan and Zimmer can disappoint you at the same time
","What a sad disappointment! To be fair, it's an OK movie.. However it fails to deliver in regards to the strong story telling expected from Christopher Nolan; also makes you wonder what happened to the great movie scores Hans Zimmer used to compose. Matt Seitz has a high opinion of the movie yet says: ""If somebody were to ask me if I liked this film, I would tell them no. I loathed parts of it and found other parts repetitious or half-baked. But, maybe paradoxically, I admired it throughout"". I agree with him except for the last part. I didn't find much to admire about Dunkirk except for the camera work."
96," The best thing about Dunkirk is that it ends.
","When I first read about the Dunkirk Evacuation, I was in awe- and the possibilities of exploiting and furthering this particular emotion were boundless in Nolan's 'Dunkirk'. Unfortunately, this movie falls embarrassingly short of its promise. Let's start with the positives.-The acting: In my view, any great war film needs to not just have great characters, but also great ACTORS to portray those characters. In this aspect, Dunkirk shines. The acting is brilliant, as can be expected when your cast features the likes of Cillian Murphy, Tom Hardy, Sir Mark Rylance and Harry Styles(?). There isn't a moment when any character exhibits an emotion out- of-the-ordinary, and there isn't a single actor in the film that falls short of acting talent or ability. -The music: Contrary to a lot of other people, I actually quite enjoyed the background score- the theme of foreshadowing, which is at the center of the movie's premise, is brilliantly explored in the score. Now, to the (rather long) list of negatives: -Redundancy and repetitiveness: As you've probably heard already, Dunkirk's story is told through three perspectives/timelines: The mole (aka land), The sea, and The air. Unfortunately, while this idea holds enormous promise, it only results in redundancy and confusion. There are times in the movie when it is unclear through whose perspective the story is being told, and there are times when scenes become repetitive. This is particularly apparent in the scenes shot in the air. Maybe this was intentional, and if it was, Nolan succeeded here. To me, it just seemed like poor editing and confused direction. This results in the movie seeming exceedingly long for its 1 hour 45 minutes run-time. -The inability to convey the scale of the evacuation: This, for me, was perhaps the most blatant flaw in this movie. You would think after a $150 million budget and the sheer scale of the actual evacuation itself that the movie would truly convey the likely thousands of ships/boats that were involved. This is just not the case. Throughout the film, we probably see maybe ~10 planes and about 20-30 boats/ships. This, in my view, does not do justice to the miracle of the evacuation, and greatly detracts from the promise this film initially had. -The emotionless characters: This, in my view, is the biggest problem with Dunkirk. The thing is, there just isn't enough dialogue, there isn't any background on ANY of the soldiers that makes you empathize with them. The consequence of this is that when a semi-major or major character dies, you don't feel anything. Really, all you think is: Well, I've already seen 100s of random soldiers die anyways, why is this different? Again, maybe this was intentional, maybe the point was to trivialize the deaths of even major characters to the point that they are no different from any of the other deaths. I personally didn't enjoy it very much.All in all, Dunkirk is a film with a lot of promise, and an incredible potential for awe-inspiring characters and story lines. However, its weak character development, and lack of ability to truly convey the enormity of the Dunkirk Evacuation ultimately lead to its downfall, and result in a film that inspires neither empathy nor awe. Very disappointing."
97," Bloodless, boring and empty
","The Guardian summed it up like this: ""Bloodless, boring and empty: Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk left me cold."" This is the most stupid movie I have seen in decades. It starts with the main 'German' actor speaking German with a horrible accent. Non of these actors convinced me of being German, the main actor utters constantly clichés like 'just kill them all'. It follows the old Hollywood pattern of 'the good guys, against the bad guys, and of course in the end the good guys win. The enemy is just mowed down, everyone of them shot from the airplanes. I had to force myself to watch it to the end, and sat there in disbelief how such an unauthentic, stereotypical portrayal of an important part of WW II history can have accumulated so many positive reviews."
98," The British soldiers who fought their way out of France deserve a better movie than this one -- Not Recommended
","Twenty excellent movies could have been made about Dunkirk in WWII. This movie, however, is not excellent; it's not even very good. Two major reasons why: (1) For the important roles of British soldiers, men who in reality fought their way out of France, sacrificing many in combat and enduring tremendous privation, injury, terror, and hardship, the director chose to focus on soldiers who think only of their own survival--certainly there were some men like that in WWII, but it is simply a waste of wonderful and compelling raw material to produce this movie out of all the possible scenarios the director could have chosen.(2) This movie skimped terribly on sets. It was embarrassing to watch a few hundred men on the beach, one or two Royal Navy ships in the water, two British planes in the air, and a handful of civilian boats. This movie does not give an accurate picture of the beaches or the mole.This movie simply does not do justice to the hell on earth that was Dunkirk. I have to wonder why they bothered. I had looked forward to this movie and was very disappointed."
99," No soul and void of compelling characters
","I had very high expectations for Christopher Nolan's latest offering as I'm a big fan of his previous work but Dunkirk is the first of his films I really don't care for. For pros I would say the cinematography, sound mixing and soundtrack are excellent but Dunkirk was missing the most important elements for any film; Characters and a story!!I was blown away by the opening scene and thought this would be another masterstroke by Nolan but there are so many problems with it. Apart from the lack of any interesting characters, the script feels so aimless at times and while watching the film I felt like someone was constantly pressing stop and rewinding. I also had a problem with the dialogue. The lines between the characters were very rigid and did not move the plot along. There was very little emotion in Dunkirk and while I did like the soundtrack I thought too much emphasis was placed on trying to convey tension through the music, be it the ticking of the clock or harsh synths building to a crescendo in the background. The strangest thing and most disappointing was that the film feels like it is building to something bigger the whole time like a grand finale but it never arrived. I had no problem with the fact that the story was non-linear but it doesn't matter what pattern the story is laid out in if there are no people at the centre of the story. I really don't understand how the ratings are so high so far because it doesn't deserve the plaudits it's receiving. I expect the rave reviews to continue as film critics don't seem to be able to judge a film for themselves these days.Very disappointed."
100," I won't get that wasted time back
","Expected so much after all the hype but left feeling that I'd wasted valuable the time.Glorified garbage which concentrates purely on the German aircraft strafing the beach and not what really happened and the mass slaughter that occurred on the edge of the same beach. The movie spends the second half concentrating on one family who take part in the rescue, easily leaving the dock which is now in Naval hands and then a very boring trip to Dunkirk in which the father lost his son to a rescued soldier who was freaking out and yet no one blinked a eyelid. Utter garbage, just another film Warner Bros has spent vast sums of money creating a story about nothing and marketed with a similar budget."
101," A failed experiment
","Dunkirk is drastically different from any WWII movie I've seen. It's Nolan's bold experiment in exploring novel ways to tell stories from WWII. While his attempt was admirable, I felt extremely disappointed after seeing the movie. Nolan spent no time on developing the characters or telling stories, but instead fabricated a complex movie structure. Some may say that Nolan is intentionally keeping the story simple so that the fear and anxiety on that day can be better conveyed to the audience. However, the intricate time line setting constantly distracts people from the scene and makes me wonder whether he is trying to tell a story or showing off his wild imagination.If one just looks at the story line of the soldiers, he or she may think the movie is a documentary. The protagonist has almost no lines while constantly trying to escape from the beach of Dunkirk. We all understand the cruelty of war and don't need to spend nearly 2 hours in watching a coward running to learn that. Nolan's flat story telling style is a disaster and is the biggest barrier lying between the movie screen and the audiences. Just before I was almost convinced that this was a documentary, the romantic depiction of the fighter pilot pulled me back to thinking it was still a Hollywood movie. The fighter jets didn't miss a single enemy and safely touched down on the sea and beach. Wait Nolan, I thought you were going to tell us Dunkirk was a total disaster. Why suddenly you switched to this romantic depiction of war heros and hope?When I saw the civilian boat leaving the harbor, I thought the main character would be the old gentlemen on the little sail boat. However, all he did was pulling a bunch of soldiers from the sea and navigate the boat through the war zone. The pivotal civilian fleets and common English men who changed the course of the WWII were not at all emphasized in the movie, given no more than 1/3 of the screen at maximum.The purpose of a movie like this is either telling a story or expressing some kind of emotion or a combination of the two. Nolan hasn't done either as there are no developed plot or characterers. I guess he was betting his novel three-stranded story telling would compensate for the weakness. But I have to say it's a failed experiment and does not deserve any higher score than 5 on IMDb."
102," Upset my tummy
","This movie gave me seasickness that lasted an hour afterwards! And no, I wasn't sitting in one of the Cineplex immersive ""D-BOX"" moving seats, just in a surround-sound ""UltraAVX"" theatre. I should have closed my eyes for periods of the camera movement.The rotation among scenes was a game attempt to make up for a skimpy script. Much of the dialogue and acting was realistic - leaving quite a lot that wasn't. Also, some technical details were puzzling, such as scenes in which one might expect the characters, boats and ships to be hurrying, yet instead they seemed to be dawdling, perhaps to fill the film out; and ships appeared to be at anchor in the middle of battle.Not sure why anyone would want to watch this movie, even though a lot of money obviously went into making it. Need convincing that we should avoid war? As a companion said, ""If this had been on television, I would have turned it off."""
103," Bad Movie. All are paid reviews.
","Let me tell you the truth. This is not a good movie. I really don't know how and why this movie got good Ratings. May be because of Christopher Nolan's Trolls as always. or may be paid reviews.Anyway, Movie is really BORING. This movie could have been much much better if they didn't try to show this in Christopher Nolan Style. In whole movies there is just one thing, They just keep adding new Background music, keep it increasing to make us feel tension.No any story, no character development, no any explanation. Nothing. Just weird things keeps going everywhere. I had to take a nap for 10 miniute.Such good war movie shouldn't have given to Christopher Nolan.I suggest don't go for it. ask your friend before going or just watch it in PC."
104," A war vehicle running low on fuel
","The words ""Christopher Nolan"" and ""disappointment"" are not words I would naturally associate but for me, they apply where ""Dunkirk"" is concerned. It promised so much from the trailer: a historical event of epic proportions; Kenneth Branagh; Tom Hardy; Mark Rylance; Hans Zimmer on the keys; the director of such classics as ""The Dark Knight""; ""Inception"" and ""Interstellar"" : what could go wrong? But it just doesn't work and I've spent the last 24 hours trying to unpick why.A key problem for me was the depiction of the beach itself. The film eschews CGI effects (which I would normally commend) in favour of the use of ""practical effects"" and the involvement of ""thousands of extras"" (as the rather glutinously positive Wiki entry declares). Unfortunately for the movie, there were some 400,000 troops marooned in this last patch of civilisation ahead of the Nazi hoard, and all of the shots refuse to acknowledge this scale of potential human tragedy. Yes, there are individual scenes of horror, such as the soldier walking into the sea against the impassive stares of the young heroes. But nothing of scale. At times I thought I'd seen more people on the beach on a winter's day in Bournemouth.My disquiet at this deepened when we got to the sharp end of the rescue by the ""small boats"". In my mind (and I'm NOT quite old enough to remember this!) I imagine a sea full of them. A sight to truly merit Branagh's awed gaze. But no. They might have been ""original"" vessels. but there was only about half a dozen of them. A mental vision dashed. The film attempts to tell the story from three perspectives: from the land; from the sea and from the air. The sea though gets the lion's share of the film, and there is much drowning that occurs that (I am aware) was distressing for some in the audience. Nolan also pushes his quirky ""timeline"" manipulation too far for an audience that largely expects a linear telling of a classic tale. It's day; it's night; the minesweeper's sailing; then sunk; then sailing again; a Spitfire crashes, then crashes again from a different perspective. I know many in the audience just didn't 'get' that: leaving them presumably very confused! That being said, the film is not a write off, and has its moments of brilliance. Kenneth Branagh (""Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit"", ""Valkyrie""), although having a range of Nolan's cheesy lines to say, is impressive as the commanding officer. Mark Rylance (""Bridge of Spies"", ""The BFG"") also shines as the captain of the ""Moonstone"": one of the small boats out of Weymouth. And Tom Hardy (""The Revenant"", ""Legend""), although having limited opportunity to act with anything other than his eyes, is impressive as RAF pilot Farrier. His final scene of stoic heroism is memorable. Fionn Whitehead is also impressive in his movie debut, and even Harry Styles (""This is Us"") equips himself well. The cinematography by Hoyte Van Hoytema (""Interstellar"") is stunning with some memorable shots: a burning plane on a beach being a high spot for me.And Hans Zimmer's score is Oscar-worthy, generating enormous tension with a reverberating score, albeit sometimes let down by unsuitable cutaways (for example, to scenes of boat loading). Elsewhere in the sound department though I had major issues, with a decent percentage of the dialogue being completely inaudible in the sound mix.I really wanted this to be a ""Battle of Britain"". Or a ""Bridge Too Far"". Or even a ""Saving Private Ryan"". Unfortunately, for me it was none of these, and this goes down as one of my movie disappointments of the year so far.(For the full graphical review, please visit bob-the-movie-man.com. Thanks.)"
105," Rubbish
","This film does no justice to those, like my father, who survived the horror of Dunkirk. The scenes on the beach are thin. There were many more troops and the beaches were packed, the aerial attacks were far worse than shown. The number of German aircraft shot down by rifle fire, which was important, is not shown at all. The destruction of the town and the bravery of the troops defending it is not shown either. Maybe I expect too much of a documentary and not so much Hollywood filming. But scenes of people drowning and struggling to get to the surface probably do not depict the true horror of the situation. This film is not worthy of the name ""Dunkirk""."
106," What an absolute Turkey !
","Normally I love this kind of wartime historic movie but it was absolutely terrible, just a total Turkey. Dunkirk is a infamous piece of British history, it was a disaster like the film !The filming itself is reasonably good, but the biggest thing that lets it down is the soundtrack. Hans Zimmer should be fired ! It is constant relentless noisy drone through literally every single scene, that adds nothing and which totally ruins it. When it switches from one scene to another the same drone continues ! It is doesn't feel in any way 1940s, and neither does it feel British or French apart from the very last scene, but by then I was glad to get out. At the very least the entire soundtrack should be changed.There is almost no speaking or chit chat at all by any of the characters so you know nothing about them not even their names. Again not natural. Even in the very first scene when he arrives on the beach and takes a drink from another soldier. They don't even speak which isn't natural and just not what British people do. Strange stuff also happens in that the young lad seems ill and then dies on the boat but there is no clue why ? Has he been shot ? You don't see anyone German at all other than another bomber or another Stuka. The film could have been so good in that the scenes themselves look okay(ish) but it just doesn't work as a film. When all the little ships arrive together this was quite nice, and one of the main legends of Dunkirk but they don't make enough of this. In conclusion save your money and watch it on TV instead but only if you are a real WW2 buff.If you want to see a real genuine movie about how it was flying Spitfires etc then watch the Battle of Britain film, hint they don't fly until they run out of fuel, It is literally about 5 minutes for a Spitfire to fly back across the English channel to refuel."
107," 2 thumbs up!
","Christopher Nolan succeeds in the challenge of describing a non-winning subject (a stinging military defeat) and highlighting the spirit of solidarity and hope. An uninterrupted and deliberately oppressive music, a high-quality photography, talented actors, ... two thumbs up!!!! As a sweet euphemism, I'm not a fan of war movies, but Christopher Nolan signs a masterpiece of the seventh art."
108," Dunkirk ?
","No, just no. Appalling. Now I've got to come up with 5 lines of text! The John Mills version is far more watchable. My father was at Dunkirk, he'd have been horrified at this film. What a waste of time and money, and it's not even historically on the nose. Santa Claus Conquers the Martians is a better film."
109," Terrible Movie - Proof that critics are paid off
","A wise man once told me ""the Majority is always wrong"" and if you doubt this. All you need to do is watch this travesty of a movie which is an insult to the intelligence of everyone who paid to see this movie.No plot, no character development, no dialogue for god sakes, I would be stunned if anybody leaving the theater even knew the names of any character in this ""movie""now I may not be Roger Ebert, but aren't those things I mentioned pretty much essential to ANY movie? Is it technically amazing as some have stated? perhaps, but I could stare at a Windows 10 background and get the same visuals, the movies need an actual story, actual plot advancement.The entire movie consisted of basically 2 scenes, a plane flying, and a ship leaking, the end. my entire section was falling asleep. For me, this was Christopher Nolan living off his name, and critics being paid off, the great reviews that this film has gotten is an affront to the intelligence of the movie goers, and is completely absurd. By far the worst film of Christopher Nolan, and one of the worst of the year, which means it'll probably win an Oscar. What a joke."
110," Over-hyped and terribly loud and annoying soundtrack
","I don't write reviews very often but feel compelled to do so on this occasion. I was really looking forward to seeing this film after all the rave reviews. But to say I am disappointed is an understatement. This has to be one of the most over-hyped films of recent times, with little storyline, depth and narrow focus of such a significant event in WW2. In addition, the soundtrack in the film has this constant VERY LOUD screeching music and effects that frankly just got on my nerves, totally spoiling the little enjoyment I would otherwise have got. Save your money and avoid."
111," Insulting
","Quite simply this film was an insult to the men and women who lost their lives in world war 2.
Their is no scale and no emotion.
I was expecting saving private Ryan but got little more than a home made art house school project."
112," a disappointing cinematic experience
","Well, that was an experience! I've just seen 'Dunkirk' the film. Hard to be rational about it after all the hype and expectation but I can honestly say that it is one of the worst films I have ever seen. A film with no meaningful story-line or content but plenty of bombast. And noise. Oh, the noise, the noise! It was loud, excruciatingly loud, unnaturally and unnecessarily so, far beyond the pain barrier for my ears. Which I had to cover for much of it as I found it so physically painful. Why so loud? I came out of it reeling and shell-shocked. And as for the 70mm IMAX giant screen experience, what nonsense. I get sharper and better quality pictures on my home TV. It was just very much bigger. The actors wee Mark Rylance and wee Kenneth Branagh were cruising, not having to act at all, just look heroic, misty-eyed and lantern-jawed from time to time, and think of the money. And given given the budget it was disappointing to keep seeing the same three Spitfires, one German Me109 and a single Heinkel He111 in the same shots over and over again. And as for that near-end shot of a burning Spitfire on Dunkirk beach set to Elgar's jingoistic music, that said it all."
113," Like a 99-minute computer game cut scene. Without CGI.
","SPOILER ALERT: The Germans won this bit of WWII.Tawdry rubbish. Summed up by the modern train carriages the 'soldiers' board at the end.Saving Private Ryan's famous opening scene had you flinching and wincing at the succession of gory death scenes without letup; you never had time to worry about WHO was getting butchered. In order to stretch exactly that sort of thing writ large with ships and planes to an hour-and-a-half, Christopher Nolan has had to allow some kind of characterization to happen. The suspense occurs in that you never know whether the character you're looking at (I'm sick of Steadicam btw) is going to last another few minutes or not. This movie is for the generation that has grown up with live, amateur disaster footage.This is a terrible way to inspire any kind of identification with the characters; everyone is expendable, and none of them are drawn in any depth whatsoever. A little vulnerability here, a little courage there, but after half an hour of this all that's left is the spectacle of violent, horrible death. And Kenneth 'No-Lips' Branagh practicing for when he inevitably does Churchill. (The English politician, not the car insurance bulldog. I won't be advance booking).This is why 'Dunkirk' resembles a series of computer game action scenes cut together. You're just waiting for the next one to find out if anything happens. And the music, sorry, the synthetic drone that goes on throughout (what happened to war movie themes?) adds to that sensation. No development, no change in mood - apart from stealing 'Nimrod' from Elgar (a cliché, by the way) - and in the end, no surprises apart from unexpected death. The whole movie feels synthetic, ie artificial, instead of engaging your deeper emotions.It's technically interesting - I wouldn't say 'impressive' - and may look authentic compared to 'traditional' war films, but it's actually just as false, and has less emotional involvement."
114," An OK movie but far from a great movie.
","Hard to understand the hype attached to this movie. As usual Director Christopher Nolan's penchant for the non-linear method of direction makes the usual shambles of the story line. Given the promotion for this movie I expected more and waited, unrewarded unfortunately, for the seminal moment that would lift the movie above the average to the epic magnitude of the actual event. The movie lacked .... scale. For example the RAF lost well over 100 aircraft during the evacuation but Nolon would have you believe only 3 RAF aircraft showed up. The Germans also lost well over 100 aircraft, some say closer to 200+. Same with the loss of equipment. Left on the beach at Dunkirk were enough weapons and equipment to equip 8-10 Divisions, and included 800+ field guns, 500 anti-aircraft guns, tanks, trucks etc etc None of that scale was represented. In fact the long lines of troops waiting on the beach in the opening scenes soon disappeared and the beaches were left empty in many scenes long before the movie reached its peak. The Seminal Moment in the actual event was that some 700+ small boats left England to help rescue the stranded troops. Nolan managed a ""fleet"" of about 10 or 12. Again, no sense of scale. Many are claiming this is one of the best war films ever. I don't think so. I felt short changed to be honest because it lacked the scale of, for argument sake, the opening scenes from Saving Private Ryan."
115," Dreadful
","The idea of this film had so much potential. The execution is dreadful.First off most of the soldiers are too clean, to well fed. Uniforms are clean and also every helmet is pristine green paint. The few we see actually waiting on the beach failed to reflect the terror of being bombed and strafed for days on end. Talk about sheep standing in line waiting at the abattoir!! The acting is a best wooden, at worst non-existent. What a waste of Mark Rylance, Kenneth Branagh and James D'Arcy to say nothing of Tom Hardy.There is zero character development, resulting in zero emotion and zero identification with the plight of the characters.OK Spoilers! What was the point of the kid on the boat falling down and dying? Since when do Spitfires have limitless ammunition? ( in reality they had 15 to 20 seconds of ammo ) How can a Spitfire with a dead engine shoot down a bomber? Why did Tom Hardy land his Spitfire towards the Germans and get captured? Why did the soldiers hide in a boat that was outside their perimeter? I could go on but what's the point.Finally, I laughed out loud when Branagh, standing on the mole said 340,000 had been saved, How the hell would he know that? Don't waste your time and money on this film."
116," Cash grab by exploiting an emotional and historic topic
","Technically, the movie was strong. But that's about it.Watching the movie felt like as if everyone involved with the movie knew very well that since the topic is something that touches an entire generation of people around the world and the sheer scale and significance of the event the movie allegedly portrays, people will and should just slurp it up. Who cares about the story and how it unfolds? Why work on it when we'll just keep showing the horrors of war using nice VFX? People are BOUND to say it's good or they'll be called insensitive.Zero efforts were made in storytelling. It was not a movie and neither was it a documentary. No story to call it the former and not enough facts to call it the latter. It was just a cheap effort slapped up together to have a sure shot way of earning profits.And why shouldn't they? Look at the raving reviews calling it a masterpiece. They do it because it works."
117," Over hyped by those who have no real comprehension of what this film is about
","I only write a review when a movie is being badly over hyped. Very, very few people alive can actually remember Dunkirk. It is a certainty that those who have written the glowing reviews are neither historians nor veterans, and have no concept of the reality of this World War 2 chapter. This film in no way reveals the true scale or horror of the evacuation of the British Army from France. Perhaps all these generous 9 and 10 star reviewers feel that Christopher Nolan gave them a first hand education and true taste of war. He did not. The film is grossly inaccurate n both the detail and the representation. I won't repeat all that other critical reviewers have written - please read some to get a balanced view. However there were some 350,000 troops and some 800 boats. Not the small numbers depicted here. Similarly, it was not fought by 5 German planes and 3 British Spitfires.This was pure Hollywood indulgence for Nolan. Spitfires that glide without fuel forever. No blood. No groans. No cold. No shivering - not even in a cold, waterlogged uniform. Poor continuity. A debatable soundtrack. A woefully poor use of acting talent and lack of meaningful script. A film does not always have to be truthful or realistic to be a good film. This film might have provided entertainment for some, but for those who suffered and died in Dunkirk or those who wanted to see the truth, this film is a true let down.There were also a lot of cheap short cuts used in making this film but, if a film about Ryan Gosling dancing and playing the piano can steal Oscars, this certainly will.I gave it 1 star to help bring down the average but would otherwise have given it 5."
118," The most overrated director of our era
","Nolan showed promise more than a decade ago - albeit flawed, but entertaining - with ""Memento,"" but it's been strictly downhill since then starting with the utterly predictable movie (I forget the name) about the twin brothers' magic act.Except for Batman fans (average age: 16?), it has all been downhill since: nothing new, nothing of any serious entertainment value for anyone over 16. I guess there is a box office draw for that crowd.""Dunkirk"" tries SO HARD to be a film for adults, but it consists of one dreary, uninspired scene after another.I left the cinema about 1/3 of the way in.I think this shall be my final encounter with Nolan. There are too many other up-and-coming directors whose work deserves attention and evaluation."
119," Forgettable, Dull and Absolutely Overrated
","""Dunkirk"" is a forgettable and dull war film absolutely overrated in IMDb. There is no character development and the viewer does not care for anybody who lives or dies. The shallow screenplay is awful and the Batle of Dunkirk is limited to the evacuation of the Allied soldiers, most of them British, that stay in lines on the beach or on a dock attacked and slaughtered by the German airplanes. The plot focuses basically in three simultaneous storylines: the first based on an old man with two teenagers in a boat trying to rescue soldiers; the second on a Spitfire pilot that crashes his airplane on the water and is rescued by the old man; and the third on a Navy Commander in charge of the attempt of evacuating the soldiers. Better of watching again a classic war movie than spending 1h 46 min watching his terrible film by the usually overrated Christopher Nolan. My vote is three.Title (Brazil): ""Dunkirk"""
120," Instantly forgettable, yet of such a sad historical event.
","Definitely cold and empty, no character development, and so why have movie stars.Not in the same league as Saving Private Ryan, or Hacksaw Ridge, as it didn't really feel like a movie. More like a fly on the wall, with a lot of apparent continuity errors, from grey sky to suddenly blue, and then back to blue again. The movie felt rushed, trying to set scale yet overlooking story, and characters.I am not sure of the target audience, but had I not spent the price of a movie ticket, and been watching on TV, I would have turned it off after 20 minutes."
121," Very Powerful...
","Christopher Nolan's newest film Dunkirk is a psychologically harrowing war film about one of the terrifying events occurred in history. While it may not be one of his best films, it still is a profound, powerful war film that truly honors the fact based story and event. Nolan crafts this film as if we, the audience is one of the frightened soldiers attended at the tragic yet distressing event that plays at the big screen extensively realistic. Dunkirk does the best job at satisfyingly delivering the frighteningly realistic portrayal of war and the evacuation in the outlook of the soldiers who were desperate at reaching home. What makes Dunkirk one of the best war films and eminently realistic are the production designs which has a usage of substantial boats, planes etc, the impressive performances and the top- notch sound design.Most films especially superhero action flick consistently include large reliance on CGI. It has become the crucial trend in the film industry. Nevertheless, Dunkirk has none of that. It uses practical effects, real-life locations, and substantive components. As a result, when boats sink or planes blow-up, it makes these additionally terrifying and hand-gripping. Dunkirk has some of the best aerial dogfights ever put to screen. Unlike the typical war films, Dunkirk isn't about sympathetic characters whom we know about their history or the amazing, drastic action sequences. This film mainly focuses on the evacuation and the survival throughout these drastically harsh conditions that are far from survival. It shows three directions which are the beach, standpoints at the boats, and the air. These three viewpoints intertwined concentratedly expressing the chances of survival of the 400,000 soldiers stuck at Dunkirk. The sound design was terrifyingly perfect embodying the gunshots, airplanes, and the crashes more resonant and an enhanced viewing experience that was memorable. All of the actors are great. Nolan used plentiful of young actors as the frightened soldiers. The main standouts were Tom Hardy (Farrier), Kenneth Branagh (Commander Bolton) and Mark Rylance (Mr. Dawson). All of these characters appear as the central focuses at the beach, the air, and the boats as they balance these stories. Mr. Dawson appears as one of the civilian vessels marching to help the soldiers. Additionally, Harry Styles (Alex) had an impactful presence along with Fionn Whitehead (Tommy). Overall, Dunkirk is an emotionally impactful and powerful war film about heroism, survival and a deep message that evacuation can be the victory along the supports of civilians. Nolan crafts this film thoroughly realistic, gritty and brutal for a PG-13 rated film. While the characters may not be the strongest, this is about war, the horror of the moment.Grade: A"
122," Hated it!
","There is no context, so if you don't know the history, it's rather pointless. A lot of suffering by people you don't get to know or care about. And probably the most obnoxious soundtrack ever created. It's a relentless ticking and pounding throughout the entire movie, making what little dialog there is harder to understand (which is par for the course with newer movies). And the theater (screening room) I was in had it so loud I covered my ears the whole time so as to not damage my hearing. Of course, it's technically proficient. But most movies are. We've advanced technically while story telling has gone downhill. I'd have walked out had I not taken a friend. I guess it's okay for video-game mentality: action with no purpose. But if you're looking for an engaging story or insightful history, you won't find it here. And, though I didn't live in that era, the behaviors seem inconsistent (selfish) with the documentaries, veteran interviews, and films about WWII I've seen."
123," Slow and Heavy Handed
","Hard to understand why so many people like this film. Slow, lacking in suspense, and extremely heavy handed. Hint for all beginning screenwriters and directors, audiences aren't stupid. If a pilot will run out of fuel late in the movie, you shouldn't have multiple discussions between the pilots discussing fuel supplies-one is plenty, we'd get it. Hint for all cinematographers and directors-when you are showing scenes of squalor, unhappiness or unpleasantness, the photography should not make it look like a travel poster advertising a great vacation spot. (Terrence Malick never got this, nor did the makers of the Revenant.) This movie demonstrates how to take an exciting situation and suck all the life and suspense out of it."
124," Best war film ever made
","Utterly stunning in every department. Can't find a single fault with the film. My grandfather was injured at Dunkirk and I wish he was still alive to see this. if it doesn't win the best film Oscar, there's something wrong. To James Cartwright (0/10 guy trying to get his political points across). Did you actually see the film?"
125," A step back not only from Private Ryan but even from Pear Harbour
","The facts:No emotional attachment to any of the shallow characters. What are the names of the various protagonists? Dunno.-The scale of this historical event, which should be comparable to D- Day is terribly depicted. The entire operation is run by 3 (three) airplanes, a handful of small boats and some hundred men on the beach.Three insignificant and repetitive story lines: let's escape from the beach, dogfight, sunk ship, crashed airplane, repeat until you reach 2 hours of movie.In the whole movie there is barely a drop of blood. Not a wound, not a bleeding, not a severed limb despite the soldiers being bombarded several times on an open field. Ridiculous. The graphic revolution started with Private Ryan is forgotten. The bombing scenes are less captivating and tense than Pearl Harbour.A disappointing movie in terms of script, acting and technical filming.One more demonstration that online ratings in 2017 are utterly useless."
126," Not really a movie about Dunkirk
","******* this review may contain spoilers *************** If you are like me, a WWII history buff, and excited to see a new movie about the battle of Dunkirk, you will be totally disappointed. It feels like a low budget movie, you don't see any German soldiers for the whole movie. What?? how do you have a war movie where hundreds of thousands people fought and you don't show what's going on the other side?It would have been better named as 'some side stories during the battle of Dunkirk', because that's what it is. The title is misleading, it's called Dunkirk so people would see it.There is this endless air battle between couple of airplanes that's like half the movie, totally unnecessary. Nobody need that much detail about a fight between couple of fighter planes. The other half the movie is about a little fishing ship going to Dunkirk to carry some troops back, I don't really care about that either.I feel like I wasted my $12."
127," Average at best. Over-hyped unnecessarily.
","The film is about an unacknowledged story of WW2 where 400000 men, on a beach, were struggling to survive. Movie shows that despite large in number but still helpless to fight, 300000 soldiers were rescued off the beach by civilians. And instead of getting booed for their cowardliness, they were respectfully welcomed in their homeland. Basically showing a fresh perspective on war that sometimes survival is also a victory. The moment you walk out of theater, you will forget the film. No strong characters, unnecessary time line shifts to show a straightforward story made me loose interest in the film. IT IS JUST AN ORDINARY FILM. What could've made it interesting? A focus on how the French sacrificed a lot as an allied force knowing that only 30,000 can survive and British were the first preference. A focus on why only 30,000 soldiers could be saved. This is an interesting one. The water at the beach was very shallow and only one ship could sail ashore at a time during high tide (every six hours or so). A proper background of the events that led to 4000000 soldiers stranded on the beach. It was one of the most clever plan by Germans to make them helpless. Leaflets were thrown (start of the film) asking the french to look at the map. They are surrounded by German army on the front and ocean on the back. There is no way but surrender. However the french saw the shallow ocean as an opportunity to escape ad survive. All these details are missing."
128," VIEWS ON FILM review of Dunkirk
","Christopher Nolan, a period piece, and a warfare movie. It's an interesting amalgamation. What did I think? Eh, meager disappointment at best. My latest review is Nolan's 2017 release, Dunkirk. The story of Dunkirk is a true one. It's not handled faithfully and it has big Chris achingly trying to reinvent the combat wheel, Nolan style! It's about a rather large evacuation in World War II. Allied soldiers were taken from the beaches and harbor of Dunkirk via the summer of 1940. And in case you are wondering, Dunkirk is a medium-sized commune in northern France. Frustrating, overly thought-provoking, icy and at times clunky, Nolan's film is told through the eyes of three different groups of WWII servicemen. Yeah its running time is 106 minutes but Dunkirk feels like it's two and a half hours long. Heck, about an hour in, I was almost ""done"" with Dunkirk. Natch.Anyway, Christopher Nolan as a director, gives Dunkirk a sterile look, a large canvas, a few nimble wide shots, and a numbing sense of being. These are the traits I like about him. However, when Christopher's style fails to correlate with the proper subject matter (forgone battle in the trenches), it almost appears like amateur hour on screen. Nolan mind you, has never been a supreme storyteller, a user-friendly filmmaker, or an expert at staging action. This is where his Dunkirk ultimately fails. For a movie under two hours, Dunkirk feels slight of hand at being a silent film. It still has a ton of scenes that don't find a rhythm and can't sustain any kind of payoff. Battle sequences involving planes, boats, and land infantry are quick, lack minimal gore (that explains the PG-13 rating), and are virtually non-coherent. Also, the actors mumble their lines and Nolan's favorite troupers from his other flicks (Cillian Murphy, Tom Hardy), feel underused while not having a lot of script material to bounce off of. All in all, my biggest fault with Dunkirk has to be the editing by Australian Lee Smith. He shapes a vehicle that substitutes wartime ADHD and spoon-fed art for tone and entertainment value. Nothing in frame is truly held long enough for the viewer to process. Basically it's the movie equivalent of someone constantly changing channels with their state-of-the-art remote. So yeah, Dunkirk has a couple of meaningful moments with a provided musical score that's equal parts stirring, absorbingly loud, and annoying. Still, Smith's edits are very choppy and very fleet. They zap Dunkirk of having any lengthy intrigue or sense of epic tranquility. Bottom line: War pics shouldn't make you miffed at trying to fit all the events together as the closing credits come up. That only works with stuff like The Thin Red Line. My rating: 2 stars."
129," Don't waste your time and money
","I'm 66 and have heard about about the actual Dunkirk throughout my life. I heard nothing but good to excellent reviews and went to see it yesterday with high anticipation. I was 1 of only 3 people in the theater. As I watched I kept waiting for excitement and story to develop. - It never did. Throughout I felt like leaving but kept thinking soon the real entertainment would begin. - It never did. This movie barely resembled anything I ever read or saw concerning the evacuation of Dunkirk. The person I went with gave it a (-2). The movie had confusing characters and scenes. If you want to see a good representation of Dunkirk see ""World At War"" - episode 4 - ALONE."
130," Overrated and factually disrespectful
","Some spectacular scenes but overall sloppy and at times annoyingduring the Dunkirk battle , RAF LOST about 90 planes and the Germans almost 400. The movie showed only Tom Hardy (and briefly 2 of his mates) taking out 10 or so German planes 800 civilian boats helped evacuate Dunkirk . We saw at most 30 close on 400,000 soldiers were evacuated. Where were they in the movie ? All we had was a couple of hundred either lining up on the beach or ducking for cover from the occasional (previously mentioned 10) German planes -other than opening scene , NO land battles. In reality , Dunkirk town was bombed by Germans with 1000 civilian casualties Tom Hardy runs out of fuel yet not only glides for ages but even manages to shoot another plane down !what was the point in casting Tom Hardy? Could hardly hear him behind his mask which he only took off at the end annoying ""music"" - continual frantic violin with occasional accompanying crashing of drums and other instruments ONE redeeming feature - no unnecessary romance !!"
131," a rather pointless and flat film
","could not see the point of this film, as usual all the critics applaud a very flawed, unemotional and very banal film i was looking for the experience, the spectacle but there was nothing. the cutting between the timelines was utterly pointless and distracting, in fact everything in the film makes sure you do not get involved, you do not care for anyone or what is going on. Again Nolan puts in really bad unbelievable things, would a pretty heavy spitfire be able to glide and manouvre for some considerable time and then do a perfect landing. once again he bombardes you with an ear splitting soundtrack, zimmers pounding racket, bombs, bullets and other sound effect have the effect of distancing you from everything. in the entire film i don't think one boat or ship was seen moving even when they were supposed to. there were over 900 boats of various sizes, he shows about ten, in the air the luftwaffe were creating havoc, we see three spitfires and about six to ten German planes. all in all an insult to the men being rescued and the people who came for them."
132," A lot of marketing, great Box Office revenue, but a massive turn off.
","There has been a massive hype for this movie on the radio and specifically BBC R2 where, Chris Evans was praising how good this movie was.The movie in my eyes has no real substance. It switches between 3 scenes, It has average to bad music, it doesn't provide any historical background, it has no dialogues, just a few lines and the constant annoying sound at the background is there to supposedly cause suspense, but in contrast it creates anxiety and is uncomfortable to watch or listen to. Last but not least, the film doesn't manage to show the scale of the Dunkirk evacuation. This is my opinion.I am sorry to say that I really struggle to find anything positive about the movie. If they gave a refund at the cinema i would have gone to ask for one. Apparently, paying a lot for advertising nowadays makes a movie a 9/10.. This is frankly sad, but I am glad other people can see the same side of the coin as myself. People that say this movie is a masterpiece, and they give a 10 star rating are deceiving other potential viewers. I give 3 stars because i want to be objective and say that on the graphic side of things there were good graphics."
133," A Masterpiece of Emotionless Boredom
","First of all, this is my first review on IMDb, and this movie made to do it. I've watched it couple of hours ago, and all I can say is don't go watch this mastersh*t. It's indescribably boring, and worst of all, there is no story whatsoever. People were leaving cinema during movie, while I was hoping something will eventually happen, but it didn't. I am so disappointed, can't believe this movie has so high rating. Probably in top 5 personal worst movies ever seen."
134," One of the worst films I've seen
","Clunky dialogue. A waste of talented A list actors. Unremitting musical score. Was this made for 12-year-old Americans? Please do not waste your money going to see this drivel. The cast must have winced at some of the local rep lines they had to deal with. A classic example of hype over substance. My uncle was one of the last off the beach at Dunkirk and would be turning in his grave if he saw this squalid attempt. Rylance in particular has to question his choice of role. Nolan obviously paid top dollar to secure him, Hardy and the wooden Branagh. Total, fatuous bilge."
135," Super boring
","What a disappointment! I went to the theatre with an expectation of seeing a spectacle in the class of Saving Private Ryan (SPR), but boy, was I in for a rude awakening! So, what is Dunkirk (2017)? It's a movie similar to SPR, but rid of ANY story and ANY character development. It's like a war documentary, but without any narration. We see the soldiers, the airplanes, torpedoes, ships, but there's no story that connects them and pulls you in. When I saw SPR, I was engrossed in the story immediately. Here, I walked out after about 30 min because the movie failed to engage me in any way.No matter what genre I watch, I am ticked off by unrealistic scenes (given the premise, of course. It is not unbelievable to watch Spiderman walk on the ceiling because you accept that the movie works on the premise that Peter Parker got bit by a radioactive spider and thus developed some spider-like abilities. However, it would tick me off if Spiderman's hand turned into a rocket launcher or a plasma weapon - that's the premise for Terminator movies, not for Spiderman.) But I digress. So, the main character sees another soldier on the beach. He approaches him and says nothing. O-Kay.... He keeps looking at him, and the other soldier, also without saying anything, gives him water. The main character drinks, returns the bottle and leaves without a word. Ummm... A ""Thank you, man"" would be in order. You would think they have some telepathic abilities and are able to communicate with thoughts. But OK - I am thinking everybody's super stressed, so I let it go. But the next scene is what really kills me - enemy planes bomb the beach full of soldiers. After the planes flew away, the surviving soldiers get up from the ground. Some remain on the ground, presumably dead or wounded. Nobody approaches the soldiers on the ground to check if they're wounded, if somebody is still alive and needs help! Absolutely unrealistic! They looked like robots, not soldiers who cared about their fellow brothers in arms.The movie goes on skipping from story to story, all of them being boring and not connected to one other. No dialog, no character development, no story! Silent movies provide more dialog than this! Just when I thought our main character was mute and deaf, he finally opened his mouth some 25 min into the movie. At the moment when a torpedo hit the ship, I didn't see the soldiers who I connected with, struggling to survive - I saw actors dressed in uniforms shooting a movie. That's the moment when I got up and left -- while the actors were still acting they were under water hit by a torpedo..."
136," Good Attempt But Lacks Impact
","This was a good try to be sure, but in truth I felt underwhelmed when I left the studio. The film is technically near perfect but it fails to show the true scale of the evacuation or the civilian and military fleet that pulled it off. Also it totally failed to show the heroic defense by the French who held the Germans back for those vital few days and allowed the British to escape.Early on Kenneth Branagh's character states that there are over 400.000 men on this beach yet we fail to see any more than 200 or so in any shot, the rest of the time the beach feels near deserted. Now I understand that hiring 400.000 extras for a film would be financially and logistically impossible yet without this kind of scale or even some clever CGI work this film feels like a few dozen guys running about on a beach being rescued by a handful of boats. Anyway, it was still a good try and the aerial dogfights with the Spitfires was magical, that alone made it almost worth watching, almost."
137," I wanted more in a Nolan film
","I saw Dunkirk at the Dolby Cinema in Eindhoven (NL) last Friday with a friend and in the end we both didn't really know what to think of it. It's by no means a bad movie, I mean visually...man...Hoytema has done terrific cinematic work. Hans Zimmers score was again a stunning combination of sound design and music. But for a Christopher Nolan film the movie left something to be desired. In the past, every film he did, it kept you thinking about it. The implications, the deeper meanings of what Nolan is trying to say to us as a story teller. This one doesn't do that. It's an unfolding of events, and although spectacular, it keeps the audience at a distance. To me the movie screamed 'look at me, look at me' but when you look at it, it doesn't communicate its message. Does it even have a message? Apart from Mr. Dawson I did not connect with any of the characters. When his son dies, I feel for him. I don't feel for any other person who dies. I would compare this with Schindler's List, which has lots of (unnamed) characters, the girl with the glasses, the little boy who tries to hide, the girl with the red jacket, to name the obvious ones. Maybe they have names, but my point is they aren't main characters and their names aren't important. But you experience some of the story by following their events. Dunkirk is a movie that's contrived only of those kind of characters and it constantly jumps between them. Even between time frames, which disoriented me.And there's nothing wrong doing this in a movie, but in my opinion you have to compensate this with context. A reason or connection of why you do this. Why are you telling it this way? Also when a movie starts or ends with titles, and those titles are so crucial to your story that if left out, you can't explain (part of) the movie, for me that's a tell that in the cutting room they discovered the movie or a part of it didn't work on its own. The jumping between time lines could have been fixed by connecting those time lines at some point halfway through the movie or maybe another clever trick. He's Christopher Nolan after all, or are we discovering that it was actually Jonathan who was the clever mind behind Chistophers movies? We don't need opening titles that tell us about hacking minds to gain access to peoples dreams. Inception tells us this as the movie unfolds, although the exposition scene with Ellen Page was a bit too much. The introduction of the Joker in the Dark Knight or Bane in the Dark Knight Rises. We don't need to know who these characters are for the audience to become intrigued by them. I for one did not know the Bane character before seeing the Dark Knight Rises. But the introduction alone, just hearing his name makes you fear him. Memento takes us on a journey discovering what's happening and what has happened. Interstellar, how it connects time and events. Cause and effect are connected. Each movie brilliant on their own. But for me, Dunkirk doesn't fit in this list of movies.Again, I'm not saying Dunkirk was a bad movie. It just isn't, and I still gave it a 7. If it were any other director, I wouldn't be writing this. But for me it wasn't enough of a movie to feel whole. For a Christopher Nolan film, I wanted more, I wanted to be inspired, I wanted to be thinking about the deeper meaning of the movie, I wanted to feel the need to re-watch this over and over and I didn't get that. I just got a movie."
138," Dreadfully Disappointing
","What a depressing movie about a tremendously uplifting event. So many stories of real heroes and heroics to choose from, this Hollywood trash is inaccurate and depressing, focusing mainly on rotten events, and seeming, at least to me, to skimp on matters like extras and facts (photos from the time show warships with crowded decks not just enough to man the sides, ships did not anchor for loading due to the air threat, discipline remained excellent to the very end, even the Spitfires gyroscopic sight in the pretty good flying simulations was wrong for the time). Apart from Kenneth Branagh's role (and I suspect he might perhaps be embarrassed to be associated with the end version as his role stood apart as fittingly uplifting), this movie is insulting to the greatest generation and the French have a right to be upset too. No doubt many, particularly self-styled intellectuals, will disagree with me, and that's okay, but as one who grew up hearing stories from those who were there at Dunkirk and who has read a great deal about it, I think this travesty of a great story is Hollywood junk(unlike Saving Private Ryan which is excellent)!"
139," On the beach
","In which Christopher Nolan attempts to do a Spielberg in widening his palette to take in a major war-themed movie a la ""Schindler"". Does he succeed, well, I don't think so. Nolan has spoken about the unusual construction of his film, taking three stories on the day, one being two young soldiers' desperate attempt to escape the carnage on the beach over the course of a week, the RAF pilots attempting to protect the air-space over the Channel within one hour and the crew of a small private boat in one day making their own way to try to help relieve the situation and then sort of sort of slow / fast forwards them all on from there, cutting from one to the next in triangular order, from start to finish. These switches, I have to say, I grew almost irritated at by the end, to the point of anticipating them even at key dramatic points in the story.I guess his big idea was that rather than attempt a massive-scale over-arching narrative of the events at Dunkirk, he attempts to tell the tale with just these three microcosms and infuse them with the different human traits at play in such a desperate situation. Thus we see the young soldiers on the run from the start displaying fear, selfishness, ingenuity but yes, even cowardice as they try anything to get aboard a leaving ship, only to end up threatened with drowning in an abandoned boat they'd hoped to commandeer and use to get to safety. With the pilots, we witness calmness, bravery, loyalty, flying skills and ultimately self-sacrifice as they fight overwhelming odds in the air while in the rescuing private boat, again we see endeavour, courage and compassion as the crew of one middle aged man and two young boys attempts to make a difference by saving as many as they can.Was this approach the best way to convey the big picture here...I'm not convinced it was. Some of the incidents seemed contrived and at odds with the realism sought for elsewhere, especially the incidents of the young cabin boy on the small cruiser and the French soldier who ends up with a bunch of hardly heroic British soldiers under deck, trying to escape drowning.Sure, the depiction of the terrible ordeals they each went through is realistically portrayed, on water, land and sea, but ultimately it lacks the realism of say ""Saving Private Ryan"", (sacrificed obviously for the 12a classification to no doubt ensure younger viewers could get to see it), so there's no blood or bits of bodies as you would otherwise expect. I'm not sure I saw even one German in the whole movie. There's very little dialogue either so there wasn't much room for acting skills to shine other than by reacting mostly with British pluck to events, which actors like Kenneth Branagh and Mark Rylance can do all day while Tom Hardy is confined almost exclusively to the cockpit of his Spitfire. The best I can say about pop star Harry Styles' acting debut was that I didn't even notice him until my wife pointed him out to me in a scene right at the end.Commendably, Nolan keeps his film to a 105 minute duration when it would have been easy to bloat it to double that length, but in the end, I didn't feel at any stage that I was actually witnessing real events, always that I was watching a movie, which for me, as I say, makes it ultimately a failure. The miracle of Dunkirk was that 300000 got home safely under insuperable odds, whereas here it seemed as if barely 300 made it. Mr Nolan should turn his telescope around."
140," I think everyone giving this a good review is a sheep....
","Bad. Saving Private Ryan, filmed 20 years ago, blows this out of the water. Someone said there is no character development to make this about all men and women on the beach/boats - what all 100 of them or so? At no point was there an exploration as to the size of the disaster, at no point do you feel any connection to any of the men or women. Of course every history buff like me will watch the film.Is it the next SPR - no,no,no. Will you want to watch it again. No chance. Buy it on blue, no. Watch on Netflix, I'm sure there will be something better when the time comes, like, well, anything you haven't already seen.I was actually bored of the stale ""dramatic"" long scene shots of actors either looking to the sky or looking to the ground. Its a very boring film in my opinion, but then I am a fan of SPR, BOB, The PAcific, Battle of Britain, Battle of the Buldge - you know, good films/series."
141," A rape of history and an insult to french memory
","Please avoid watching this movie which have absolutely no respect for history, is full of anachronisms and is a grotesque apology of anglo-saxon superiority. Learn an read about history. Nolan made a blockbuster probably to please American public. For the rest of the world an especially in France it represents an insult to the thousand of french soldiers who died to allow escape of the English troops. Prefer ""week end a zuydcoote"" of Henri Verneuil far better."
142," The Most Emperor's New Clothes movie of all time
","In 13 years of membership at IMDb.com, I have yet to write a review of a film, but this is the one that has compelled me to do it. (A sentiment I've seen more than once in other reviews of this film on this site.) Nothing happens in this movie. Nothing takes place. No events transpire. There is a paucity of things that unfold. The only way I could write a review of this movie would be to use every synonym that exists for ""nothing"" and ""happens."" The movie is 106 minutes long, and Nothing. Happens.The glowing professional reviews of this film are pure rubbish. Nobody wants to confront the reality that acclaimed director Christopher Nolan has created one of the single most worthless movies of all time, so instead they praise his colossal failure of a movie by calling it ""unconventional, ""minimalist, ""immersive,"" and any other number of adjectives from the self-congratulatory esoteric lexicon of the self-styled ""cinephile.""All that being said, I would actually go ahead and recommend you watch this movie once. A 106-minute movie in which literally nothing happens is something we've not ever seen, and are sure never to see again."
143," This is the shittiest war survival movie ever!
",I am a huge fan of nolan even after reading few bad reviews on IMDb i went to watch it. And this movie is complete piece of crap nothing is good inside this movie some one said watch it on IMAX this movie is masterpiece i assure you this movie is not have enough worth to watch it for free go for The great escape 1963 or Das boot but don't watch this crap really disappointed!
144," Did I just watched a different movie?
","Overrated. This was the worst movie that i have ever seen in my entire life. Nolan was desperate to show the struggle and the meaning of survival during World War. I know that this is a true story and the portrayal could be close to the actual events, but c'mon man, this is a movie and that's the point. Somehow, it has to be engaging. The director should have made something that will make the audience understands what those soldiers are going through at that very moment. Even if it's something that could deviate a bit from the actual events. I don't know. Maybe focus on one or two soldiers then add a little backstory? That way, we could somehow relate to any of them. There is just no character development. I still gave it a chance though because of the 7.9/10 IMDb rating. I gave this movie the benefit of the doubt. Maybe something good will happen in the middle or a mindblowing scene that will captivate me in the end, then there's this scene where all the soldiers are arguing inside a ship/submarine/boat... gunfires have been shot... and that's it.Plot:
This is a war movie based on true events (WWII) where soldiers are trying to evacuate the town of Dunkirk. They are struggling to find a good ship because the enemies are dropping bombs everywhere like... where the fck are these guys? Fighter jets flying all over the place. It's confusing because there is no distinction between the Germans, the French, the Brit, or the Belgian. I dont't have any idea who's with who. Some scenes are also confusing. There are scenes where a certain part is nighttime and the other half is daytime. Are you in different timezones? Then here comes the rescuers, the fleet comes in and then tada, the soldiers were saved. The moment they reached land, the soldiers were doubting themselves if they were an embarassment to their country (for just standing, diving and struggling) but don't worry, the people from their homeland still recognized them as heroes in the end. Bravo.I strongly believe that this could have been portrayed better. Good intentions, bad delivery."
145," Dunkirk"" is the Nolan movie that has touched me the most
","Ahh... Nolan. Who doesn't love Christopher Nolan, eh? One of the most acclaimed directors working today, a cinematic genius behind modern classics such as ""The Dark Knight"" trilogy, ""The Prestige"", ""Inception"" and ""Interstellar""... Well, I hate to be a party pooper (as always), but I have never shared the mad love every other movie fan I know has to share for him. I mean, his works are a'ight, but I never found them to be as great as everybody else seemed to think. I guess I liked early Nolan the best – ""Memento"" and especially ""Insomnia"" –, when he was more interested in characters and building suspense than just creating the biggest baddest epics available. Of course, Nolan is good at creating suspense and orchestrating action setpieces, but even his best works ""Inception"" and ""Interstellar"" have suffered from being overlong and pompous. Not to mention his third and last Batman which felt like a big pompous piece of crap. Having written all that, I liked ""Dunkirk"" a lot. It's not only one of the finest movies of 2017 (so far), one of the most thoughtful war dramas I've seen, and also Nolan's best yet. Although if you go to cinema expecting his usual, you may well leave disappointed, because this epic World War II tale is quite unlike anything we have come to associate him with. After all these years, it must be supremely difficult to create a war drama with something fresh to show or say. But Nolan is not afraid of challenges, and he has managed to pull off a movie which is both epic and intimate, artsy and mainstream- friendly, adrenaline-filled and deep at the same time. It's what the movie lovers always wait for but rarely get: a thinking man's blockbuster. ""Dunkirk"" shows the experience of war from the another angle rarely seen or thought of, at least in movies. It's about human frailty, loneliness, isolation and enduring the limbo between chaos and salvation that war is made of. Of course, there's also enough explosions and eye-candy, but the whole thing is rather artsy in a good way. Not much dialogue or clearly defined events too, just people waiting (because there's nothing else left for them to do) and trying to survive. There is not even a single clearly-defined central character, although there are several main story lines to follow, sometimes not in chronological form. The story is about thousands of Allied troops surrounded by enemy forces, trapped on the beach and waiting for rescuing. We have some well-known actors here, such as Tom Hardy, Kenneth Branagh and Cillian Murphy, but it's not really an actor's movie (ie, meant to let somebody shine) but fitting everything into a carefully crafted cinematic mosaic. Speaking about war part, I especially loved the flight and air battle scenes. The immediacy, the sound effects. Also the fact that they were often made from pilot's viewpoints, so it feels more realistic. The pilot shoots and we see target plane catching fire only after a while, for example. All in all, Dunkirk"" is the Nolan movie that has touched me the most. It's about real things, emotions and experiences, and the action is thrillng. Another beautiful achievement for one of the most liked and successful auteurs working in mainstream cinema today. Watched it in IMAX which probably add something to the experience, at least from technical standpoint. But it's surely a good looking and sounding movie on any screen or setup, methinks."
146," Wanted to like it, I really did, but...
","Just saw this yesterday and I really wanted to like it, being an amateur historian in general and big fan of military movies/books in particular (i'm an old navy sailor). Aah where to begin, I guess with the non-chronological, non-linear format; bad idea for this movie. I'm a fan of it in other genres, but it doesn't allow you to engage or get invested in the event being depicted, much less any of the people. It jerks you back and forth from ""week"" to ""day"" to ""hour."" It feels like it's out of sync throughout the whole times being depicted. I loved the Dark Knight and believe it is the greatest superhero movie ever made, plus a genuinely magnificent movie in general; up there with Ben-Hur, Raiders of the Lost Ark, The Good The Bad & The Ugly, the Godfather, even Once Upon a Time In American (another out of sequence movie), and so forth. I know it sort of raps up with all three frames, but you even get to see repetitive scenes (albeit from different viewpoints) again and again. The score wasn't anything spectacular, just a little bit overdone, and sometimes even overtook what was going on screen, bad idea. As another reviewer noted, the historical event was a big deal, this movie was supposed to ""film"" it, but you only see 7-8 boats on screen, not the hundreds that were actually used; same goes for the extras; I felt this was a great opportunity for CGI boats, planes, and people; I'm not against it for conveying ""reality"" on screen, especially on a Nolan film, the CGI would have been top-class and wouldn't have been cheesy. Also, the lack of dialogue made it more like a long documentary about the logistics of the event, even though you don't see the grand scale (with a couple of hundred extras, 7-8 boats, and 3-4 planes). I feel bad for not liking this movie more because I'm really appreciative of what the British did at Dunkirk to ""fall-back"" and live to fight another day and eventually defeat Germany in WWII. The ""Greatest Generation"" described in Tom Brokaw's book, which I read, was even greater in the United Kingdom, due to their sacrifices and shared sufferings (bombing of London and other UK cities). This movie deserved to be given one or two people to hang on to and grieve with and cheer for and be afraid with and persevere and survive with. Even though the end ends like that, it was sort of anti-climatic. This was my opinion, one man, not representative of anyone else's view point, of which we all know there are/will be many."
147," Seemed like a bad copy of a 90's Guinness Advert.
","Mediocre movie...this director obviously does not understand human emotions (inception...who was the ""baddy""?)...this film seems like he has read up on them...and then went overboard! Smaltzy..stupid in bits, it's like nothing so much as a 90s UK GUINNESS advert...I don't think you had them in USA? ""Good things come to those who wait""?... https://youtu.be/Y9znA_dwjHw The film was almost exactly like one of these adverts...right down to the scene at the end where the soldiers are handed beers....I almost expected that tagline to pop up! Soldiers commuting suicide at Dunkirk? Spitfire pilots allowing themselves to run out of fuel? Soldiers ""hiding"" in a boat? A naval commander spending the whole film alone on a pier... Miles from any communications, was this a bad metaphor?? The music...maybe it was well written, but it was overused to the point of irritation...""oh, I'm supposed to feel tense now? Thanks music!"""
148," Amazing historical fiction turned into a overblown art project.
","The subject matter of Dunkirk is fascinating true life tale of heroism and patriotism which should present the perfect canvas for a filmmaker. However, this film falls flat. Instead of a glorious landscape that puts the audience into the battle itself, we are left with an impressionist piece in which the audience must provide their own dialogue, character depth, and epic size.As other reviewers have stated what did they spend $150 million on? Dunkirk essentially presents a couple thousand men standing on the beach waiting for a ride, with a couple of planes flying around. Not exactly ""Epic.""If you walk into this film expecting Saving Private Ryan, you will simply be bored and left unsatisfied as I was."
149," Save your money
","I love war movies, I downright love them, so I went to see this recently with high expectations. Those expectations were soon dashed against a rock. This movie ... it tried to tell three stories, but told all three stories poorly. Everyone in it was two-dimensional, and it was impossible to feel a connection with any character, not even the one played by the ordinarily brilliant Thespian Kenneth Branagh. It was like the entire cast, including Branagh, were an assembly of extras. There was precious little dialog, and this movie was an utter stink bomb. This could have been a brilliant movie. Indeed, it should have been a brilliant movie. All the elements were there for a brilliant movie, but it was about like going to a ball game and someone runs the bases backward, an epic fail."
150," not good enough
","As a fan of Nolan's works, I have to say that this one was a disappointment. I wasn't going to write a review either, seeing how many have been written already, but I feel like I should. Okay, so here's the deal, for what I gathered, you'll either hate it or love it. Unfortunately, I'm one of those who hated it. Okay, hate is a strong word, so let's say that I was bored by it. The first half hour you just wait to see what will happen and for the story to kick in. But, after forty minutes in, you finally realise that the story is there, you just didn't see it. I have to read some reviews to finally get a grasp of what was happening, as the description doesn't really prepare you. After that, it's just a boring movie about ships getting sank and no dialogues. No dialogues would have mean a gold mine of rich emotional performances, but not in this case. The performances were blunt and the emotions just no where to be seen. So, what's left is a disappointing ending and the credits. Overall, I give this one a 2 because the story may have been there, but it wasn't presented nicely enough for me to see it. Plus, there was no thrill in it to keep me interest nor emotion."
151," Uh - this was a sad creation. I want my money back
","Where to start tearing this catastrophic movie apart? Many viewers will probably like the storytelling showing the same event from different angles and personal stories. This idea is copied from Kieslowski's Trois Couleurs-trilogy. There is an obvious search for fear of death by drowning or sinking with a ship in a closed locked space, but it just doesn't work. Other movies like Das Boot is a masterpiece of this, but Dunkirk isn't able to copy the feeling at all. Other points: 1. Why film a beach side street in a small French town, but do not even bother to edit out the modern buildings? 2. Show a bunch of private yachts in a harbour. Many of the boats are from the wrong era. 3. Almost 100 000 soldiers died in Dunkirk. This is not depicted in any way. It is an important part of the real story. 4. Wikipedia: ""The loss of materiel on the beaches was huge. The British Army left enough equipment behind to equip about eight to ten divisions. Discarded in France were, among huge supplies of ammunition, 880 field guns, 310 guns of large caliber, some 500 anti- aircraft guns, about 850 anti-tank guns, 11,000 machine guns, nearly 700 tanks, 20,000 motorcycles, and 45,000 motor cars and lorries. "" However in the movie we see a few rows of boxes on an otherwise clean beach.5. Both sides lost over a hundred aircraft in Dunkirk. A loss of over a hundred planes means thousands of missions were flown during those days. Yet we see 5-6 in the movie and at most 3 in the sky at a given time. 6. Men hide in a fishing boat and wait for the tide to return and float the boat again. Germans are ""target practicing"" at the boat. Water comes in through a few rifle caliber holes. Yet more holes appear under the existing ones. So the Germans are target practicing and shooting way under the waterline of the boat? What rifle shoots a hole in a metal bulkhead through one meter depth? Then the men are able to plug the holes with anything else than their fingers? While textile or almost any material could be used to plug them and avoid sinking. Plot or real stupidity? 7. The sounds were surprisingly low quality. Rifle shots do not sound like real rifle shots. The Rolls Royce on the Spitfire is off too. Hearing it live is a majestic experience, but in the movie it's not even close. Honestly I'm not sure if the cinema had their sound system tuned wrong or if it was the movie, but although I'm not much into music it bothered me throughout the movie. War is hell. This movie is like a slow funeral."
152," Void, uninteresting, and cold technical vista from Christopher Nolan
","Nolan has been a storyteller that build his movie on plot rather than character, as the latter were usually just there to move the story along instead of someone to root for. He tried to build fleshed out character in Interstellar and failed to fully portray a human emotion that ultimately renders them unable to be cared about, although he spent the majority of the film trying to get us to care about the characters. In this movie (Dunkirk) he goes back to his usual 'blank-characters and work on plots more' routine and judging by his track record and the lack of clear star actor in the exception of Tom Hardy (who is underutilized and even he didn't bring anything special) anyone coming in the movie expecting a story with no discernible characters are correct. But, what is very confusing is why did he even bother to set up conflicts for these characters (i.e one of the characters from the arc is dead from falling down a stairs (truly) after a certain Cillian Murphy uncharacteristically goes into rampage while he never hinted that the character have violent tendencies due to his shell shock) that requires us to CARE about them in the first place. Okay the 'french- suddenly-thought-to-be-German-Spies- somehow' opened the door that could save some people including the one who were there in the first frame of the film (AKA the young soldier), and that gives us a reason to care when they tried to get him out of the boat while one of the characters tried to stop him and the other are forcing him on gunpoint? If anything, the only tension and dread moment are generated by the score and camera movement and visual. The dialogue itself are..bad. it's on the nose level of exposition, it's uninteresting, and it's just overall unmemorable. Hans Zimmer is a very good composer. How Nolan approach him to do the scores for Interstellar results in a very beautiful score. But his work on Dunkirk is, to say the least, mismatched. To realize that a man like Nolan who insist on shooting his movie on film roll and practical effect would conceive a mismatched, orchestral score that didn't sound grounded and even has techno beat in it that really did not fit the pictures shown. The score is not even memorable, since there's no recognizable theme that would be associated with the movie immediately (such as 'No Time for Caution' in Interstellar or 'Dream is Collapsing' in Inception) and it seems they approach the scoring beat-by-beat rather than working on a certain mood that wants to be conveyed. The visuals are, granted, is beautiful, while there is some poorly lit shot that clearly wasn't meant to be THAT dark. But, it gets tiring after a while due to Nolan's tendencies to reuse the same shot but just from different angle and different object to focus on (like seriously why do we keep seeing the right side of the cockpit on Tom Hardy's plane, is the left gone or something?). On the plus note, the production design and sound editing are of the highest quality. Wouldn't be surprised if it will receive an award or two in that department. The movie takes the theme of survival as an event rather than a state of emotion. It renders the movie to be stone-cold in it's tense moment and dull in it's calm moment (which there is little of), and become something you'd just behold and hear and hopefully immerse yourself in it. But due to his forced effort to make us care about this nameless character, and other reason that is stated above, this could be the least interesting of Nolan's film. I don't see anyone will analyze it's story or direction or even it's color scheme which is downright limited in the coming time. I don't see it as a classic in Nolan's filmography. I see a list of things Nolan should address and wonder where to improve his next project."
153," Lacked a true villain and gives little reason to support protagonists
","With great expectations for Dunkirk as Nolan has an incredible resume, I was extremely disappointed with Dunkirk. He does a time shift for the three POV's which gives an interesting layering of storytelling; however, what was the benefits to telling to story in this way? In Memento, there is a clear purpose to how Nolan uses time, but in Dunkirk it just seems trivial. Furthermore, there is no villain, Nolan just relies on ""The Germans"" as an excuse for us to undoubtedly support the British soldiers without ever showing an evil thing that the Germans do besides bomb the soldiers, which is what the British were presumably doing to the Germans. That being said, I had no real reason to support the protagonists. Moreover, Nolan appears to rely on the audiences knowledge of Dunkirk from school and such, but as an American I had no emotional connection to the battle as I had never heard of Dunkirk before. The Soundtrack seems to be just a lot of noise and doesn't build to anything, especially with the three POV's clashing at points. Also, the British accent can be hard to understand at points as an American.In conclusion, I feel Nolan did little to establish an emotional connection between the audience and the characters. There was no battle scene, which was disappointing. I left the theater feeling disappointed and unimpressed."
154," A good film - but a few scenes missing for a classic
","What Nolan has done with Dunkirk is create an outstanding piece of cinematography, with an interesting concept that works well (the three balanced time-lines taking place at a different pace, a week, a day and an hour). However, there are just a few things missing that prevent this from being a masterpiece.The first is a simple graphical introduction with maps. I know the assumption is that most people know about Dunkirk (and being a British history teacher, obviously I know the story too), however for global audiences, there simply isn't the knowledge there to understand what is going on. For example, what year is this? What has happened in the war already (the invasion of Poland)? Why is the situation so desperate (because Germany has surrounded the allied forces and overrun the French defenses by going through the Ardennes forest in Belgium)? The USA has not yet entered the war (for American audiences), and nether have the Soviets. The French are about to surrender to Germany, leaving Britian alone to face the Germans. Dunkirks location in relation to England. All of this could have been explained with a short graphical introduction (like in enemy at the gates) of less than 2 minutes long. It wasn't, and therefore it simply looks like the British are running away without any explanation.The second thing that is missing is the desperation of Dunkirk. By all accounts, the evacuation was generally pretty orderly. However, after the initial introductory scene, there is none of this on the beach in the second half of the film. When things should be getting more desperate (and there were many thousands of British soldiers who got left behind) during the second half, it seems like the Germans stop attacking the beach (except for one lone aircraft that gets shot down by Tom Hardy). This isn't true, and in the end Hitler does order his troops to move in when the air-force fails. Not to mention, the fact that many of the small boats get sunk too - it was an evacuation under fire, this is missing from the end of the movie when the boats turn up. It gives the impression that the evacuation was somehow fine once the boats turned up and does a disservice to the heroes on those boats and the whole first half of the movie (set on the mole - ignoring the parts at sea). This could have all been improved with a bit more artillery and plane attacks at the end of the movie.The final scene which could have been included was Murphey's story - just a few scenes of his own evacuation from the beach - during the second third of the movie (increasing the fact that the mole was a week - whereas at the moment it seems it is two days, not a week), and then how he ended up being the sole survivor on his ship to be rescued - explaining why he is suffering PTSD would justify his earlier attack on the young boy. This would increase the length of the movie to about 2 hours and a bit - which is how long this movie should be. At the moment it is simply too short, and that prevents it being a masterpiece. Shame, because apart from that Nolan did a great job."
155," Fails to capture the grand scale and drama of what happened
","This movie should've been called ""What happened to a handful of men at Dunkirk"" and be labelled a documentary at best and History Channel would've made a much better documentary of it. I guess they tried to go down to a up close view to intensify but it just falls short. It's too slow to captivate, there's too few things happening considered the grand scale of the Dunkirk operations. It feels like a few hundred men were trapped on a beach and a dozen boats that came to rescue them. I can not even begin to describe how disappointed I am in this production, the only relieving factor was it not being longer than 1h 39m otherwise my head would've imploded."
156," I walked out
","Am I alone on this? I think not because I saw a couple walk out as well... Why are the reviews so good? It beats me...I'm really puzzled. Considering the cool previews, It was so incredibly surprisingly disappointing that I literally felt I was wasting my precious time at best. It's truly utterly confusing to see all the hype about it. I should have asked for a refund. I can only say that the film lacks at so many levels that one simply can not connect with it unless there is a pre-existing bias of some sort. Then again, I did not watch the end, but even if it is spectacular, which I seriously doubt, I sincerely wish that I would have done something more productive with my time and money."
157," Watch this if you want to get really bored and annoyed
","This is a war related movie which plot is that everything goes wrong in the air, at sea and on the ground. The movie is as boring as watching the grass grow. To cover up the boredom of the movie they have hired the master composer Hans Zimmer. The problem is that that Hans has accidentally composed the ""thrilling"" soundtrack for a completely wrong movie. The music mainly consists of ""thrilling"" buzzing noise made with synthesizer and also of tick-tock sound of a stopwatch which stops few times during the movie just for the reason that it can start again in a minute. The soundtrack just doesn't fit for this movie at all. Only thing I liked in this movie was the Spitfire plane which cruised on the air without an engine for couple of hours, I laughed so hard for this. There is no epic and intense atmosphere or tension on this movie, it's just so dull."
158," wonderfully produced nonsense
","My informal summary was: ""a load of crap"".I could appreciate the wonderfully filmed set pieces, but the overall work was a mess.First off the tripartite switching between Air:1 hour, Sea:1 day, Land:1 week, just didn't work. All 3 sections lost any sense of continuity, and you were left with a jumble of brief scenarios. For me this was particularly the case with the ""Air"" segments which just became boring interludes.The other really bad decision, for me, was the choice of the incidents shown. They were just populist trivia that didn't give any sense of the actual battle. For instance, the ""small ship"" is obviously based on a well known case. But the circumstances were completely changed and sensationalised do it gave no insight into the actual events - and where did the manslaughter of the young kid come from??? This segment is actually an insult to the RN who organised and in most cases manned this aspect of the evacuation.In contrast to the Air section, which was drawn out, the Land section was just a kaleidoscope of jumbled incidents that gave no sense of the passing of time (the evacuation took a week). There was supposed to be a minimal story line, but even so the uniform switching French guy and the prolonged hiding in an abandoned ship were pretty dumb, and where did the idea of ""3 hour tides"" come from. It was all pretty ridiculous, and furthermore the series of silly events, meant that there was no serious attempt to tie the ""immersive effects"" to any basis in the reality of Dunkirk itself."
159," Dull, uninvolving and nonsensical in spite of one or two moments
","There are no spoilers in this review. We know how the whole thing ends or, if you don't, stop reading and get a history book. This film is not the way to learn anyway.I had high hopes of Dunkirk. People were saying it is a great film. I remain baffled as to why. I did not quite want to walk out of Dunkirk, but I was bored and I can't say I enjoyed it. It has too many fundamental failings. Here's why.Firstly (let's start with something positive), the good points.There is a bit of spectacular photography. Some of the shots of ships are well done.The acting - Having said that there's not a lot of ""acting"" at all. Come to think of it there should be a lot more ""acting"". The characters should be more terrified, angry, resilient, defiant, chipper etc. None of this comes across but I think that's the director's fault, not the actors'.There are some interesting vignettes. They stand alone as well-executed scenes but, as I'll discuss later, they don't add up to much.Er, that's about it.Now, the things that just added up to make the film annoying, dull and uninvolving.Characterisation - I just wasn't invested in any of the characters. The ""lead"" in the form of the soldier that we follow through the trials and tribulations of the evacuation is just not a sympathetic character. He is a chancer trying to get ahead of the queue. Quite apart from the fact that he's certainly not representative of the troops at Dunkirk, it's unnecessary; he's a weasely little character when there's a much bigger story going on. The rest of the characters are largely two-dimensional. The sub-plot on the boat, brings in another unsympathetic character, is difficult to believe in, is a distraction and has nothing to do with the evacuation. If we needed character sub-plots, we'd have been much better off looking at the people back home in England, their fears, motivations etc. and we'd understand the story of Dunkirk better.There is also no sense of the real fear, desperation, defiance etc that must have been foremost in the minds of the men on the beach. In fact there is very little emotion in the film at all. We follow a couple of soldiers about for a bit but we get no sense that men are awaiting the lottery of the next Luftwaffe bombing raid, losing their comrades or wondering if they will get home to their wives or whether a Panzer division is about to come over the horizon.Scale - there is absolutely NO sense of the scale of the evacuation. The actual evacuation involved some 400,000 men. We see very few... really, very few. We hear a man on a stretcher takes the space of seven standing men but the ships leaving the harbour are clearly not full; there are just a few guys standing by the railings. At Dunkirk, men were so crammed onto ships they had to leave their backpacks behind. Surely the budget could have run to a few more extras or a bit of CGI. We see three British aeroplanes and a couple of German ones! Story - there is no real story to invest in. Quite apart from the intensely annoying non-linear narrative, there is no sense of what actually happened at Dunkirk. We never get to understand why it happened, why the commanders did what they did or what choices they had, the RAF's role, the French army's role, how the fleet of little ships came about, why Hitler didn't attack by land or anything really.Non-linear narrative - oh my goodness me! Why? Don't get me wrong I enjoy a well-constructed non-linear narrative, but this isn't it. The story jumps around for no readily apparent reason. We see things twice but then there are two planes at one point so we're not quite sure if it's the first plane or the second one. It's a mess. Again, some interesting little vignettes but not adding up to any coherent story we can invest in.And then there are all the other little nit-picking bits that made the film annoying and distracting. A soldier salutes a very senior colonel without his hat on (not done!) and then casually imparts a load of information without once saying ""Sir"". Would a senior naval officer in 1940 really say ""we're stuffed""? Spitfires could fire their guns for a total of about 17 seconds and did not have apparently unlimited ammunition, nor could they keep flying with no engine. If a plane passes you at altitude (at what? 120-150mph?) and then ditches, it will not be 100 yards or so from your boat, it'll be well over a mile away. How is the boat captain an expert in German aerial tactics; his explanation makes no sense. When you're not invested in a film, you notice these things.Oh yes and other people have commented on the score. What score? It's just noise except for the final section is it supposed to be rousing or patriotic? It's just Elgar's Nimrod played at about 1/4 speed. Score by Hans Zimmer?.. not really.So all in all while this film does have one or two moments. It adds up to considerably less than the sum of its parts. I had started giving this three stars but the more I think about it, I don't think it's worth even that. Not only could it have been so much more, it's actually quite a badly made film. Why on earth are people giving it high ratings?"
160," What did they spend the money on?
","You take 5 planes, 5-8 ships, an empty beach and some men and then you call it Dunkirk. How can this movie cost so much? There is no action and nothing historical about this movie. You just wait and wait for anything to happen but no. There is nothing of the horror the soldiers had to go through and at no fighting at all. I was so disappointed and bored during this movie."
161," This is up there with the most disappointing movies of all time, don't believe the hype!
","What a mind numbing boring excuse of a movie! I have nothing more to say than what movie did the critics see, because this was terrible, art is always the excuse when a movie has no substance!"
162," most stupid movie of the year
",why there is not a zero rating to give for this movie just do not waste your time and money the story is trivial and boring as hell compared to other war movies it worth nothing...people just start punching stars and amazing ratings for this crap but for what...i got so damn bored and fell asleep at the end
163," Worst film reviewed by awful critics
","Having watched most of this historic film, I have come to the conclusion that not only was it a disastrous attempt by an incompetent director, but that Hollywood and the mainstream media critics, are equally inept at their job.It's a shame IMDb has fallen into this category, as I have used the website as a useful guide to which films I should watch or avoid.Several strange behavioural anomalies occurred inside the first 10 minutes, which gave a clue to the complete amateurish script and direction by Anthony Nolan, related to the Nolan sisters perhaps.1. The nasty, evil, German interrogator SNIFFS the cocktail of drugs on the syringe he is about to inject into the hapless captive. 2. When punched repeatedly in the face, the captive does not move his hands in front of his face defensively as one should, even though he is not tied up. 3. Everyone talks one at a time, like a badly written script by Mr.Nolan. 4. When they find the French female spy, they debate whether to hand her over the the Nazis, because the evil, smirking, sadistic, method-actor German officer offered them passage if they handed her over. Both British and Germans were fully armed. They debate one at a time as per Nolan's pathetic style of writing. 5. When the Nazi soldiers open fire on the building, they are standing in a line in the open, shooting planks. No troops would have lasted very long standing in the open firing at other armed soldiers who were under cover, like a badly-made western.Everyone in the film behaves unnaturally, to when the British officer rebukes a soldier, to the soldier stupid reaction to stand to attention without being told.I was so much hoping for a good rendition of such an important chapter in the second World War, being British myself, and because 90% of the critics say so, it will go down as such, but the same ""analysts"" loved La, La Land, a place they strictly belong.Dunkirk is a turkey of the worst with dozens of badly written scenes too many to mention, the only surprise is the almost universal acclaim it received from people paid to review movies.It shows what a terrible state the film industry is in, and Hollywood's deference to shoddy workmanship on a grand scale!"
164," If you have seen the Trailer, you have seen the movie. Spoiler Alert
","I have anticipated the release of Dunkirk since the trailer was shown months ago. Yesterday, I finally saw it. What a disappointment! It started with a group of British soldiers walking through a town. You never find out what they are doing there. Nothing at all is told of why there are only French and British troops in Dunkirk. The troops are constantly strafed by the Germans, but only by 1 or 2 fighters at a time. I'm guessing that's all the movie budget could afford. During the real battle, the Germans stopped all attack of the troops. There is no mention of why that happened, nor is it presented adequately in the movie. The movie should have explained why the British were fighting the Germans at that time. Why Hitler let the forces be rescued. Why the Germans stopped the strafing, which by the way was a bit more than one or two Messerschmitt's at a time. There was absolutely no personal connection to any of the characters. The plot was lacking in every possibly way. When such a movie is released, those at the top usually say something like the movie was never meant to be a documentary. OK, lets say this wasn't a documentary, it still was a terrible waste of time to see."
165," I don't understand all the hype. Several scenes were ridiculous.
","This movie is a snapshot glance at possible events during the evacuation of the allied troops at Dunkirk after the military disaster following the German invasion of France in 1940. I was pretty much bored throughout the first half of the movie and at various times thereafter. Although the historical significance of the events are captured to a limited degree, several of the fictional elements shown were actions of abject stupidity and left me stunned. #1: No hospital ships were sunk by German aircraft at Dunkirk. #2: The events in the beached trawler were so absurd I doubt any person could be so ignorant. Soldiers trying to plug 30-50 bullet holds in the hull with their fingers and then thinking that killing and throwing out a French soldier would make up for tons of continuous flooding. #3: The shooting down of the German bomber (an event that would have taken 30 second in real time) took 10 minutes in film time. I decided the Spitfire must have been flying at about 1 mile an hour. #4: The killing of the teenager had no significance and was a totally pointless plot device. #5 The out of fuel spitfire then made several impossible aerial maneuvers to shoot down a German plane flying 200 miles an hour faster than it was. The only truly heroic person in the movie was the civilian boat captain who managed to dodge his boat around a German fighter attack, a totally absurd scenario. I have never, however, seen anything that indicated German aircraft attacked any small civilian boats. All and all I can't express my disappointment with this movie. I don't think its terrible, but it is certainly not praise worthy."
166," Should be renamed Dumb Crock
","I love Christopher Nolan's films. So unusual and most have great depth. He is terrific at using a creative imagination. I feel he should not have come within coo-ee of a true War story. It is not his genre. I am stunned - although I guess I should not be - at the high ratings from so-called experts. Were they facing the screen when this was on. Why do Americans have to spell everything out for us? A plane makes a massive thud into the ocean as it is shot down and one of the men says ""It's down"". Thanks for letting us know. Then you see 30 men swimming towards a boat and I think the same guy says ""There are man in the water"". Really? I thought they were dolphins. Do we really need Cellos and Horns to try and build tension. I do understand the war was tense. We don't need bloody Cellos to inform us. I missed most of the dialogue. I felt sorry for the Cello players. They are probably in hospital right now with some repetitive injury.The actors looked so disengaged. The older dude in the small boat got emotional once and it looked weird. Kenneth Brannagh looked like he was on Prozac. He probably teared up towards the end because it was possibly the worst movie ever made. Tom Hardy wore a mask through the whole movie until the last minute. One of the finest British actors and you cannot see his expression nor hear him over stupid Cellos. There was flitting between time lines without explanation. Cillian Murphy suddenly appears on a boat refusing to let some men on. Like huh? A boy gets killed for no reason and nobody really cares. The son of the captain starts to care and then he suddenly stops caring for some reason. There is mention of 300,000 men on the beach. Were they in crab-holes? Lastly with all the budget on this movie why do war scenes in other movies make these look dull?"
167," Awful
","I am someone who thinks 2001 is the greatest movie ever made. So slow artistic sequences do not bore me. However, like some other reviewers, I think this movie is terrible and it is the first time I have nodded off in cinema. Admittedly I was in one of those reclining seats."
168," It made me feel like I was in the moment
","Every time Christopher Nolan makes a film, I get excited. He is a filmmaker who has made countless classics and possesses a lot of creativity. It's interesting to see him make a war film like Dunkirk and after watching it, I wish I witnessed it in a cinema.Dunkirk recounts the extraordinary event where soldiers from Britain, France and Belgium are trying to get evacuated from Dunkirk whilst being surrounded by the Germans.If there's one thing you can be sure of when going into a Nolan film is that the film is going to be a cinematic experience. I really regret missing Dunkirk at the cinemas and watching it in IMAX because this film is a technical achievement. I love Nolan's usage of practical effects in all of his movies. It shows how much he cares about realism in his films. Dunkirk uses real boats, real planes and thousands of extras to make this event look as authentic as possible. I couldn't stop marvelling at how amazing this film looked. The camerawork was absolutely incredible. There are a lot of beautiful shots and it wasn't too shaky.The sound design and sound editing were fantastic. The spitfire scenes looked so real and the sound they made whilst firing didn't seem unrealistic at all. The editing is very tight. This is one of Nolan's shorter films but that's not a bad thing because it doesn't waste time or overstay its welcome. Right from the beginning you are in the moment and doesn't give you any time to breathe until the end. Hans Zimmer gives us another impactful score that heightens the tension during every scene.A major complaint will be the lack of character. This film follows three different perspectives of the event but there isn't anyone you feel a personal connection with. That is the only flaw I can pick out. I would have loved to connect with someone particularly but it's important to remember that Dunkirk is about the event and not the people. During an event like this, it wouldn't feel right for characters to talk about themselves or their family since their main priority is surviving. I feel all the actors involved conveyed the intensity of the situation and fear of survival through their expressions.Dunkirk was a riveting experience. It's a humongous spectacle that's makes you feel like you're there with the rest of the soldiers. It's a film that intense all the way through and another successful triumph for Christopher Nolan."
169," It's not ""Saving Private Ryan""
","I really wanted to like this movie but unfortunately it felt like a painting by numbers, CGI, generic war movie.The story lacks depth, there is very little in the way of a plot and the film jumps between day and night with no real explanation of what is going on.I didn't really feel connected to any of the characters in the film, which is surprising as my grandfather was actually rescued from Dunkirk.Yes there are some nice visuals, but the movie dragged and just felt like a collection of monotonous, repetitive, scenes, with little to break it up. The soundtrack did nothing to lift the movie.It's a real shame because it could have been much better. To me it felt like a jumbled mess."
170," Complete tosh
","Terrible interpretation of what happened at Dunkirk. Nothing redeeming, just don't watch it!"
171," Such bad storytelling
","I've seen good films made by Nolan, and I've seen WW II films of all qualities, but this is a horrendously bad film of any genre. After seeing the two recent Churchill biographies we thought this would fit into the theme, but anyone interested in history should avoid it. Appallingly disorganized and badly directed by Nolan, only the abilities of the seasoned actors held this disaster's head above water."
172," Unbelievably overrated
","Slow, boring, and lacking emotion. Can't believe this is so highly rated. Extremely disappointing."
173," Very disappointing and too overrated
","I watched this movie on a flight to New York by seat screen. I was so disappointed by the very poor action. Even the story gave nothing substantial to me so that finally I felt asleep. I am happy I didn't spent a cent nor wasted time. i cannot still believe how director Christopher Nolan and his crew could create this catastrophical work. See instead Saving Private Ryan or The Band Brothers mini series. 
It deserves no doubt 1/10."
174," A Spielberg, Kubrick or Stone, Nolan is not.
","The last truly bad WWII film I ever saw was The Thin Red Line. Dunkirk seems to want to compete for that spot, but still comes in slightly ahead.I like Nolan, I really do. Interstellar was one of my favorite movies, Inception was great and I loved his recreation of Batman. I also love WWII movies, Band of Brothers being one of the best stories ever to grace the screen, in my opinion. The entire time watching this movie, though, there was one nagging question I had: What if Spielberg directed this?Chris Nolan really isn't suited to take on a film like this. Dunkirk is a historical drama, about one of the greatest feats in WWII. This has two strikes against Nolan; one is that it's a historical drama, unlike the rest of his portfolio. The second is that WWII is, by its very nature an ""R"" rated period (so to speak) and Nolan seems to thrive in semi-tame PG-13 violence.""War is Hell""... yet nowhere in this movie do we ever sense that. There's a huge difference between gratuitous violence and realism, mind you and I am not promoting the former. Steven Spielberg is the master of understanding this. Some of his movies are rather violent, yet they use that to drive home the plot and atmosphere of the film. Chris Nolan really, really, desperately needs to take some notes from Spielberg in this area if he wants to be a true master of his art. The desire to stick to this catch-all, watered down PG-13 cash- cow rating, almost seems forced, considering the time period and the topic covered.Realistic ""R"" rating aside, the tedium of the movie sets in rather quickly. Had I not paid money to see it, and waited for its TV release, I would have changed the channel about 15 minutes in.This story sets itself up for about half of the film. It takes that long just to understand the characters, their motivations, their situations even their names. Once that's done, the movie starts to show us some promise and hopes to drops us into action, but ends up easing us down gently. Critics may commend Nolan for keeping an even momentum, not letting one part overpower the next - unfortunately it carries the momentum of a brick wall.The history of Dunkirk is a fine example of human will and strength, it just doesn't make for a gripping story. The events that this movie cover, can be summed up in about 2 pages of a text book, not an entire novel nevermind a 2 hour movie!A book editor once told me that you should always focus on telling the most interesting moment of a character's life. While the evacuation is interesting, in this movie, it seems the most interesting moments took place just before the events it covers. How did 400,000 soldiers end up getting pushed back to the sea? What battles were fought that drove them so far? What tactics failed so catastrophically?Dunkirk tells half a story, with the more interesting half taking place before the movie starts. The two hours of this movie could have easily been compressed into 1 hour, with another 2 hours telling the larger story of how the events transpired that led to this point.Acting wise it's hard to tell. Mark Rylance almost revisits his role as the Russian spy, Rudolf Able in (a much better film) Bridge of Spies. It works. His calm demeanor, yet screen presence is felt and you do make some connection with his character. Of course, that may also be because his character has one of the larger speaking roles throughout the entire film.The rest of the actors are wasted, especially Kenneth Branagh, who has proved himself, time and time again, to be an ""actor's actor"", but has been almost sidelined for the duration of this movie.I would recommend waiting for this film to reach a cable channel before you fork out the $12+ for a ticket if I would recommend this movie at all. As it stands, do yourself a favor and binge watch Band of Brothers in order to get a much more rewarding WWII experience."
175," How the hell is this rated 8.3 ?!
","What a dull film, two hours watching a bunch of extras stood around on a beach. The usual British bashing, poorly portrayed as either cowards or mindless and paranoid. There is no story, no likable or relatable characters. There's little action, tension or depth, no one seems in any great rush (boats just sit around, drinking tea waiting to get sunk. The disjointed time frames are not clever but annoying. It's so cheap too hardly any boats, five planes and crappy explosions, beautiful blue sky and a lack of effects. No one hardly says a word, it seems so amateur. The last 10 minutes is OK. The actual story could have been so much better, with a good script and director. I think of great war films ""Saving Private Ryan"", ""Hacksaw Ridge "", ""Fury"" and regret that this is a missed opportunity."
176," Do not waste your time with this crap
","I went to see this movie thinking it was a great world war 2 story filled with action story and suspense and with lead actors in the shape of similar world war movies like Hitler the rise of the evil, valkyria , the downfall the red thin line and so many others.Unfortunately I was wrong. there were no main lead actors no particular story and action and the only thing the movie had was how those soldiers were trying to escape from the enemy using planes, boats etcetera.After an hour or something I fell asleep bored and left the theater wanting my money back as this was more like a docudrama than a real movie.problem was not so much that the movie was bad as it was B-O-R-I-N-G showing the same thing all the time.GRADE Favoid it at all costs"
177," Mind-numbing, repetitive and pointless
","My wife and I left about 80 minutes into the movie. The first 10 minutes shows a pair of soldiers trying to get off the beach on to a boat to England by any way possible, fair or foul. It shows planes flying in formation, breaking off formation, a pilot's eye view of a hard turn, a close up of the pilot, and some gunfire from a plane. It shows the goings-on aboard a small civilian boat heading to Dunkirk to rescue trapped soldiers. It shows a military boat sinking from a bomb or a torpedo, men jumping overboard, and others struggling not to drown. The next ten minutes shows the same thing, as does the next ten minutes, the ten minutes after that, and ... you get the idea. After about our fourth round of ""we've seen this already, and this is going nowhere"", we left. The ""trapped underwater"" scenes are very disturbing even if deaths are avoided or not shown.The beach, sea and aerial scenes are on different timelines that I assume converge at the end, but it can be very disorienting to jump from day to night and back again between scenes not knowing where the three timelines are relative to one another. There were a few instances of coming into a scene knowing exactly what was about to happen because you had already seen it on another timeline.I've seen 60-second commercials with more dialog and character development than this movie had 80 minutes in. What a waste of time and money."
178," Best war movie I have watched. A masterpiece from Nolan
","This is another masterpiece from Christopher Nolan. Brilliant acting by Tom, Mark, Fionn and Harry. Amazing war scenes. When i saw the movie, I could actually feel the atmosphere of the world war. The film is directed and presented perfectly by the perfectionist Christopher Nolan. I will watch this movie again and again. That's how much I liked it. This movie is definitely in my top 5 favourite movies."
179," An unbearable musical about the Dunkirk evacuation in WWII
","I was confused wheather I went to a nightclub or the movies, because the annoying music sounded from the very beginning right until the end, nonstop, it was criminal. This musical resource is getting ridiculous in general, but especially for a war film, as it takes all the realism away from combat scenes, there is no music in war, why would a director would chose to avoid a single moment of silence is beyond me. The movie barely had a script and very confusing timelines, it was difficult to understand what had already happened and to match it with other scenes about the same events. There was very little dialogue and the characters were very shalow, watching them getting killed did not make the slightest difference as it was not emotional connection to them. All scenes were constantly drowned in loud, annoying, dramatic music trying to somehow convey the desperation those soldiers must have felt, but overusing that resource ruined the movie for me, I left with a headache. Some truly unrealistic scenes also, especially close to the end, where that Spitfire runs out of fuel and still manages to shoot down a German Stuka. Terrible movie, the critics must have been bought, there is something off about that 8.5 score, dozens of people agree with was a 1 star film. Weird."
180," This Year's 'There Will Be Blood' . . . .Spoilers
",". . . . referring to another critic's darling that was actually a very, very bad movie.This picture is even more badly miscalculated than 'Interstellar', which is saying something. Historically, Dunkirk was a logistic miracle, in which a disorganized flotilla of amateur yachtsman managed to spirit off 300,000 plus British soldiers, trapped by Nazi forces.Now, if you want to do a micro story, fine. But you do have to put in scale. Instead, we have these meandering lines of soldiers on the beach, fewer numbers than in some cineplexes. We see nothing of the flotilla until 90% of the movie is gone, and even then it's a throwaway.The bulk of the movie is spent on a single ship, a single Spitfire, and a couple of rather unlikable soldiers looking for a way home. It took me quite a while to realize that the stories were not in sync, that I was looking at several different time frames. How clever! What totally unnecessary complexity!This might STILL have worked,except that Nolan does not bother with any more than the barest exposition of the characters. So instead of seeing the Grand Evacuation, we see the struggles of several ciphers, completely out of context.Add to that an ear-splitting, incomprehensible score, and you have - not a disaster movie - but a disaster."
181," Could not hear the dialouge
","I hated the movie. Reason being, I could not hear the dialogue. A lot of the movie was me trying as hard as I could to understand the dialogue. I could not understand 97% of it. I will never see another Chris Nolan movie again. I had trouble hearing due to the loud soundtrack over the dialogue, as well as the sound effects, and the accents. In the theater, I was wondering if it was just me. But googled it after the movie and see others had the issue too."
182," Terrible, I have almost lost my hearing
","Nolan is one of my favorite directors and I was waiting for this movie to come out and finally it did. For the first time in my life I had to literally escape the theater because the volume was unbelievably high. There were so many high frequency sounds that I couldn't stand listening to the soundtrack. I play in a rock band and I am used to loud sounds and yet I had to exit the cinema. It took me nearly 2 hours to fully recover. Some of the people had their hands covering the hears for most of the scenes. The movie is amazing but I think it's totally useless if you can't enjoy it. Would you still like a beautiful sunset next to a worker operating a huge drill? I will wait for the DVD to be able to lower the volume and watch the ending. I read an article where Nolan replied to similar complaints saying: ""That's the way I like it"". Well Chris, I hope you like this review too."
183," Cartoonish flim-flam!
",I am not going to write hundreds of words describing the almost infinite number of flaws in this movie as others have said it all very eloquently.If directors want to make a cartoon version of an event then surely they should have the guts to tell us it is a cartoon? This movie is about an historical event called 'Dunkirk' and any person with an iota of knowledge about that seminal event in British history would expect to see a story that closely approximates that event. This is not that story!
184," Very Disappointing
","Very Disappointing,I was expecting a really good movie, with all the equipment around today I was Expecting a movie to be Remembered, for Ever and it be a monument for our lads that offered, and all too many times gave there lives, at this battle, the old black and white movies are still the best and by the look of it they will take some beating. its such a shame there was so much potential, for a movie to remember. Their was one good thing about it though, with not many speaking parts in the movie There were no F*** words in it, so I actually saw the movie through to the end, well done for that, nasty words spoil so many good movies, and TV programs, and that turns them into movies u can't sit and watch with the family.My uncle was in the navy he joined up underage, He wanted to do his bit, his ship was sunk, he saved his friend who was badly injured, his friend died later while they were in the water, He was the only Survivor, he still wanted to do his bit, so he went back to sea and he was sunk again, but he Survived along with many more lads from his ship. God Bless Lads thank u all for helping to save our Country's our lives and Life as we know it."
185," Much hype--ended up rooting for the Gerans
","Lots of explosions and gore--no character development all, some wonderful Ed Wood like continuity problems (scenes changed from day to night to day to night even though all the action took place within a few miles of each protagonist). Frankly hard to tell who was who.The film missed the three major points of interest of Dunkirk-- 1. the bloody resistance the Brits and allies must have put up to keep the Germans at bay long enough for the evacuation to happen; 2. how the order to mobilize civilian ships in the rescue effort was communicated, and some background and insights into the men and women who responded so gallantly; and 3. how Churchill and the folks at home reacted to the news and how Churchill kept everyone's pecker up.Don't waste your money"
186," One of the most over-rated films of all time
","I hated this film. Why? Don't get me started. But then again, let me get started. The whole tone of this film is all wrong. There is something 'flat' about the whole thing. First of all, there is no battle here. What we have is a series of isolated skirmishes usually involving a few planes here and a few planes there. In fact, this film has so little 'scope' in terms of battle intensity that if I didn't know better I'd say it was shot on a low budget. The film has no star power. It's filled with a bunch of actors I never heard of. Tom Hardy is in it, but you'd never know it since he's wearing gear in his Spitfire.The film is told exclusively from the British side and there are no German characters in it. Since the film is so dry and dull being so British, one can only speculate on whether it would have been of help to get the German perspective as the battle unfolds. Aside from one scene with street fighting, there is no action involving tanks or infantry. All the airplane and ship stuff just get monotonous. The film cross cuts tediously to a small boat in which an older man and two young guys are heading to Dunkirk with a sailor they picked up at sea and two young soldiers, one British and one French, who are using their wits to just get off the beach and into a boat or ship. In fact two thirds of the movie involve this small boat and these two soldiers trying to catch a ride home.As a point of comparison, 'Fury' absolutely crushes this film and if you want to see a good world war II movie I recommend that one. ""Enemy At The Gate' also had some really powerful battle scenes. I just think they could have done this much differently and much better."
187," Wastage of money and mind
","I am really a big fan of Nolan sir, and this is the worst movie I have ever seen in my life, complete Boredoms, no climax no thrill, no war, just full of noisy sounds. Do not waste your time and money. Expected a lot from this movie, heard a lot of stories about Dunkirk. But is this the way of spoiling and that too by such a great director."
188," The Most Boring War Film Of All Time
","Just really want the time i spent watching this dull, no character depth, waste back.The story skips so frequently, amongst beach/air/sea, and amongst many fragmented characters (none of whom you will care about) that its torturous.Its like its challenging you to make it all the way through.....Not even the odd random appearance of Kenneth Branagh looking wistfully on as ships get sunk, or peering through his eyeglasses towards the end will make me give this higher than a single star Truly the most terrible film I've seen in some time, and easily the worst war film ever made.The genre should have stopped at Saving Private Ryan Truly, truly fricking awful"
189," Big disappointment
",After seeing the ratings on IMDb I had big expectations for this movie. The movie starts abruptly. There is no set up for the main story of rescue by private citizens. There is no sense of large numbers of private citizens being involved. There is no real emotion developed throughout the story. I never really cared about any of the characters. I simply missed whatever it is that most people felt made this an 8.7. I have seen news reels that were better done. It is the only time in all my years that I felt I could have created a better story and done a better job of directing than those actually involved.
190," Wish I could give it a 0/10
","Absolutely garbage film. The worst WW2 flick I've ever seen and 2 hours down the pan.There's probably more dialogue in Castaway than this lazy, poorly thought- out depiction of a truly epic real life event.Honestly, don't believe the hype and do not waste your money."
191," The worst war film ever made...
","Hello,I saw this film 1 hour ago and the only thing i can say it is the most epic fail film you will never see. The film has 50 words said in the whole film. The most annoying thing is the god damn music and sounds. From the start pf the film till the end it is the same annoying violin sound that after 1 hour of listening to it i left the cinema room. I have seen many many war films and this one honestly is the worst of all. It does not only disappoints you buy also that music or sound annoys you till you cant watch the film anymore. Compared to other war films like saving private ryan this film is like eating bugs after a chocolate. Disgusting movie...."
192," No Nazi flags in the movie so don't see it.
","Just heard on the radio that this movie purposely removed all Nazi symbols and flags. I refuse to watch this rubbish and support these people who wanna change history because something offends them. It's WW2 and show Nazi flags. Many people said it's a great movie , it's a shame the politically correct had to rear their ugly heads again and ruin a movie."
193," too much visual, poor writing
","Nolan goes overboard with the visuals, but forgets that a movie must have a good writing behind it, some emotion, I wasn't able to feel invested in any of the characters. For a war movie, there wasn't any tear dropper moment. It felt more like a survivor mode kind of movie, which is great and all, but I missed the feelings behind the whole history. Not a bad movie, but after creating this huge expectations I can't help but feel very disappointed."
194," What a confusing boring movie.
","Wow, what a letdown. War movies are usually this confusing. But come on? Seeing Cillain Murphy on boat (shell shocked) and then seconds later pushing kids back in water saying be back. Was told it was a different TL. Well what other different TLs were then? No movie should be that confusing! Not 1 seen German all movie yet shooting or shooting practice? Lol. Ya that's even confusing. Never see who was shooting at boat. Or Hardy partner that left or landed in ocean. Still not sure if guy who couldn't get outta boat was with Hardy crew? He who was low on fuel at beginning of movie and 2 plus hours later still flying. This not a review. This a questionaire. And ohh ya when then loud ass build up music does every 10 minute and nothing happens? Kinda gets annoying after 7th time! Think Nolans good but this was terrible or at least most overrated movie ever"
195," An exquisite film.
","Awards will follow.How often can any of us say that a film lives with us for days, I've not been able to add that tag to anything I've seen in years. Within the first few moments of this film I knew this was going to be such a film. Most of us will know the incredible Dunkirk story, the fear many would have had I think would have been that the story was sensationalised, or lacking the real essence. All you can say is Christopher Nolan has once again shown his genius, this film is a masterpiece. You have no choice but to feel raw emotion as you watch, feelings of despair, hope, anger, fear, terror, you will feel exhausted having watched this film.The acting is impeccable, every single member of the cast performs to an incredible standard (maybe Harry Styles's character will irritate one or two,) Mark Rylance is utterly sensational, as is Kenneth Branagh, the scene where his character looks up and sees the fishing boats arrive is one of the most moving in the filmThe camera-work is astonishing, as is the music, which for me was one of the most powerful elements of the film, it built tension to enormous degrees.There is a realism in this film which I find quite incredible, at times it's so difficult to watch, it brought elements to life I hadn't even thought of. I can see this being used in history lessons of the future.The only real question is how many awards will this win. See this film, it's utterly incredible."
196," Good Film but Disappointing at the same time in many ways
","Just watched the movie on 70mm film and the image quality was exceptional. For the most part it was an enjoyable and entertaining history film about survival during war. It had some great suspense and thriller elements to it. In fact some of the sequences were very Hitchcockian in nature that they reminded me of Hitchcock's Foreign Correspondent. If i had to categorize this movie i would say it's an Action-Thriller that takes place during war.My first problem was the Sound & Music. Both were too loud, annoying, distracting, and monotonous that several people got up and left. I almost did. It's the same problem that the dark knight rises suffered from. They mixed the sound so high to make the action and explosions appear grand but it fails since the visuals don't work. There's only one director who can direct great action and explosions and make it look grand and epic that i almost believe its a work of art, which in a way it is. That director is none other than Michael ""Bad Boys"" Bay.Second problem i had with the movie was too many cuts to secondary characters that i didn't care about. Not to mention i barely cared about any of them since I never got to know them. They should have stuck with just three stories: the pilot, the father and son, and the two soldiers trying to survive. Period. I don't care about the generals, random soldiers, or Cillian Murphy's character either.Third problem i had with the movie was it didn't have a grand scale or scope the way it was advertised. The film tries hard to want to be epic but fails. On the posters it states that over 400,000 men were trapped but in the movie i didn't see that at all. Honestly, it was more like 2,000, then there was like two planes in the sky and a half a dozen boats. Really? That's what you called grand? If you enjoy a historical Action-Thriller that's full of suspense then definitely check it out. Bring some ear plugs if you can."
197," Red Badge of Dunkirk?
","Where to begin... The ""soldier lost in the complexity of war"" has been done before, and I had high hopes for the film, but I was just disappointed. First, this movie is grim. Not grotesque, just depressing and grim, so prepare yourself. After reflecting on it a while, I think the movie just felt too thin. Thin on scale, thin on character development, thin on dialogue. For a movie called ""Dunkirk"", if you don't know anything about the battle going in, don't expect much coming out. It's really 3 interwoven vignettes about personal experiences during the battle, mainly 1 group fighting (air), 1 group running away (land), and 1 group trying to get into battle (sea). But for a massive operation with hundreds of planes and ships and hundreds of thousands of men, it just felt puny. Imagine a movie about D-Day where the invasion force is 3 allies against 3 Germans on the beach, with a couple of planes and a ship tossed in for drama. That's the feel. Movies like this can work if they have the feel of man as a small cog in massive machinery, but this just missed the mark for me. And the music was grating. Several times it overtook the screen action in a glaring, bad way. Just not a very good film. Not a total clunker, but not great by ANY means."
198," Overrated
","How this film is getting such rave reviews I'll never know. Technically and visually it's a stunning. After that it's pretty dull. It may be historically accurate, but I want to be entertained when I go see a film. I want a story. I want 3 dimensional characters. I want to engage with them. What I got was something that felt like tedious cut scenes in a computer game that never got to the fun part. I don't know if the lack of emotion in most characters was supposed to be stoicism, but when a young boy gets killed by accident they barely bat an eyelid. Just don't go expecting a blockbuster. Expect a big budget history channel reenactment."
199," War for Generation Y
","Regarding the movie DunkirkWhen Saving Private Ryan premiered in Bristol 1998, I was the youngest person in the theatre. Around me were elderly English war vets. I could tell, they wore their veteran uniforms and veteran badges. During a couple of hours elderly men and women quietly sobbed in their seats watching, and possibly reliving, the war all over again. This wasn't a normal cinema experience and I don't think I will ever experience one like this again. It changed my view on war and the fact that I and my country Sweden, in fact have no experience of war in modern time. But we are pretty much the only ones in Europe, or the entire world for that matter, with a 200 year history without wars. Steven Spielberg pulled this off. He made Europe remember WWII all over again and he educated the young and helped (?) elderly to closure. Spielberg is a movie maker who knows very well his genres and how to not mess with them. Enter Chris Nolan. A movie maker famous and known for science fiction and fantasy. With Dunkirk he shows at least me that he is as predictable as a dull Adam Sandler. My biggest concern when I sat down to watch Dunkirk was weather Nolan would stay true to the genre or if he would put his sci-fi magic into it. After ten minutes I realised I was watching Interstellar again and I had to fight the urge to actually leave the theatre. What annoyed me the most was the sci-fi sound effects, scifi music score and the shallowness of the historical event. Is the movie good? Well, Nolan's fans will probably like it, Generation Y will like it but people who, like me, had a life changing experience with Saving Private Ryan, won't be as thrilled or impressed. Imagine Schindler's List in the hands of Christopher Nolan. Darn right, thanks but no thanks. I didn't like it at all."
200," A wasted opportunity
","We had been waiting with anticipation to see this film. It had received mixed reviews but we kept open minds. I'm afraid the bad reviews are correct, the film is wasted opportunities. There is a far better Dunkirk made in 1958 starring John Mills and Richard Attenborough which stands head and shoulders above this latest attempt. Or the BBC 2004 TV film starring Timothy Dalton and Benjamin Cumberbatch which explains how the rescue was planned and implemented. Both had more realism and drama and made you understand the incredible feat that Dunkirk was.The Dunkirk story is as much about the little ships but little was made of these, they just started across the channel with much of the film taken up by one of them. There should have been nearly 2000 vessels of all sizes involved in the rescue but all we saw were a handful at best. Similarly the RAF flew nearly 5000 missions over Dunkirk, not the three or four planes shown. The weather in 1940 was also inclement over France for nearly a week which prevented the Luftwaffe from taking off. The film shows a beautiful blue sky.On the French beaches, there wasn't enough actors or CGI to make it look like hundreds of thousands of men waiting for rescue, more like a couple of hundred at best. The French soldiers were indicated by half a dozen actors and there was no Indian or other Colonial troops represented, just queues of caucasians. Meanwhile Branagh stands woodenly, gurning at something for most of the film. Rylance might as well have been the BFG as there was no difference in his acting.The worst part was Tom Hardy as a Spitfire pilot (probably more accurate to have given him a Hurricane which out numbered Spitfires and were tasked with attacking bombers). The end of his role was just unbelievably silly. As was scenes of downed aircraft floating as if they were made of wood and polystyrene.I would like to see a Peter Jackson version of Dunkirk. Nolan's 2017 attempt is a weak script and weak directing, both of which are his responsibility."
201," Snoozefest
","This movie was all over the place and extremely boring. Lots of overly dramatic build up and then it sputters out like one of the Spitfire's landing in the sea. There really were no leading characters, just different story lines that merge together in the end. I did not feel the fear or suspense of the retreating soldiers like some of the positive reviews have said. I understand that not every war movie needs to be gratuitously violent and rather tell a story, but the characters really had nothing that can excite or interest a viewer. Most of the characters are extremely boring and show little to no emotion. The one shell-shocked soldier portrayed seems almost forced. I never really cared about anyone because they were all severely undeveloped characters. I don't even know any of their names because they were so forgettable. Lacks in action and story. I am sure that their is a great story to tell about Dunkirk, but this movie didn't deliver."
202," Worst war film ever made
","I'm getting sick of these paid reviews. I feel too defeated to even write this review. What a waste of £17. This is right up there as one of the worst war films I've ever seen. You know it's bad when multiple people in the audience shout out ""That was s**t"" at the end.There just isn't a story line, a beginning, middle or end. There's no point to it. It had so much potential as the picture and cinematography are so realistic. That's pretty much all it has going for it. Not to mention that Tom Hardy is in about 5 scenes and says all of about 5 words. Massive disappointment."
203," A Tense Film That Is Hardly the Average Summer Blockbuster
","Dunkirk marks Christopher Nolan's return to cinema and it is as bombastic as one would hope. Featuring a fractured sense of story telling, a shockingly great performance from Harry Styles and some of the most breathtaking cinematography I've ever witnessed, Dunkirk is without a doubt one of the most solid summer blockbusters in recent memory. Despite all that is perfect with the film, it does suffer from some glaring storytelling issues that, while many may enjoy, I found to be unnecessarily tedious.While many of you will probably hate on me for saying this, I simply have to say it: Christopher Nolan is overrated. There is no other way about it. The man has given us classics but flawed classics, at best. However, Dunkirk is a perfect response to my feelings towards Nolan. The film is extremely fast paced which is something that plagued Nolan since Batman Begins. Here, he is restrained and it pays off quite beautifully especially when you factor in the brilliance that is Hoyte Van Hoytema's outstanding cinematography. The film is big and Hoytema's determination is shown through every frame. He is dedicated to capturing beauty and here is no different. Hoytema serves as a very suitable replacement for Wally Pfister.The film, while being 106 minutes long and probably Nolan's most accessible feature to date, also is very scarce when it comes to dialog and general character development. There are very few characters here that will have you standing and cheering for. I mean, you're going to cheer at moments in the film. It is geared to do just that. But it won't have you gravitating towards Styles, Rylance, Hardy or Murphy. Quite frankly, they all have (with the exception of Styles) minimal screen time. Those looking for a Tom Hardy war movie better think again. This isn't about one soldier, it is about all of the soldiers. No one is more important than the other. Overall, Dunkirk is an exceptional addition to Nolan's impressive filmography. Crafting a unique war film that doesn't rely on overtly patriotic moments to move it forward is hard yet Nolan makes it seem effortless. The film relies on the courage and sheer will power of the human soul and that is something only the rarest of war films can do. Despite some wonky story telling, Dunkirk is nonetheless exhilarating and should absolutely be seen on the big screen."
204," Idiots guide to the history of Dunkirk
","I gave this 1/10 due to the nonsensical 10/10 reviews given by previous reviewers, who obviously either worked on the production, have never seen Casablanca, or are completely stupid.A 3/10 for CGI effort and 2/10 for bothering so a real score of 5/10. Well, What can I say to this utter pop culture nonsense, well Sorry i APOLOGISE ! to all that were involved in this real-life mess, Dunkirk was a disaster in reality and after watching Nolans attempt, I feel only more pain and humbling to the real soldiers who were trapped and left to die, by the commanding forces of the Britsh allied Armies, who sent these poor men to what was pre-warned to be a disaster.Even if we compare the recent attempt to the 1958 Leslie Norman version we see that filmmaking despite the obvious technological advances has seriously gone backwards, Teacher states could do better, and as for Nolan don't give up the day job ...Tescos that is."
205," Awful
","I'm generally hooked on historic movies, usually fascinated by the aspect alone that the events displayed really happened.Sadly however that is about the only grace the movie can offer. Absolutely bland & one-dimensional characters, the antagonist SS- Officer was a complete joke - especially if you're capable of the German language. (grammatically this didn't even resemble German at times + there wasn't a single authentic line in the entire movie.) In its entirety Dunkirk has nothing to offer, but a few 'heroics'. - Not once have I been sucked into this story. Not once have I felt an inkling of the immediate threat of the situation.All that aside, perhaps the worst thing about this movie are the overwhelmingly positive reviews of critics. I know war hero stories from WW2 are a sanctity few would mess with - but this movie stands as a shameful testament towards that bias. I was expecting more from Nolan, hopefully he will get back to his old self."
206," 8.4? Were we watching the same movie?
","I sat through the movie and walked out concluding it was a near dud. A confusing attempt at anachronistic triple time line story telling, no discernible plot or character motivations, minimal appearances by the only two actors I recognized (one of them thanks to Netflix), no women, etc., etc., etc. I gave it a ""3"" for photography and effects. Much better expected from Christopher Nolan. Save your money and get it on video. Or not at all."
207," I'm sorry, the hype is wrong
","There honestly is not much too say about this film, so I will be brief and to the point. Also, let me preface my opinion about this film with the fact that I am a Christopher Nolan fan, but this was not the film to make. Dunkirk is without a doubt one of the biggest letdowns that I have ever seen. It is absolutely one of the most boring, tedious, slow ""War"" films that I have ever seen. Visually stunning and appealing? Sure, Nolan is known for that. Plot? Bad. Character development? Poor. Action sequences? Non-existent. I rarely leave a theater let down by a film and this one let me down. I'm sorry, but this is not a 8+  or 90% RT worthy by any stretch of the imagination."
208," Boring and forgettable
","After the trailer and all the good reviews I thought, that this will a great movie. But then I watched it and was seriously disappointed.
The movie goes on forever and it felt like it was 4 hours long. I will never understand why Nolan put in so many good actors, because they barely get the chance to act. For example the ""main"" protagonist doesn't really say something for like half an hour. There is literally not one character you care about. The soundtrack and the camera work, however, were great.
Overall, I can see why people may like this movie, because it is different from other war movies, but I sadly didn't enjoy it and maybe my expectations were too high."
209," I have been robbed
","This was boring, unrealistic and a total waste of money"
210," A waste of time
","A shallow cut-and-paste movie with barely a discernible plot; which kept jumping all over the place. Mark Rylance would have been a better anchor, if his character had been beefed up. Lacked a significant female role."
211," That's a Hard No...
","I saw this recently and have to weigh in on the ridiculously high ratings everyone seems to be giving.
The chopping and changing of scenes that overlap the timeline make the movie so damn confusing. Half the movie you're watching a plane drop out of the sky and you start to feel it's an Inception scene and you're screaming ""would the van just hit the water already!!!""
Whatever made them think this would work is beyond me.
Not to mention the lame perspective they showed of an armada of civilian ships coming to the rescue. In reality the rescue operation was large and the fleet was massive. In the movie they show one fishing boat and a ferry. Whoop whoop! We're all saved!! Please....
Oh, and its bloody loud! And I dont mean enjoyably loud, I mean ""grab your ear buds matey, or you'll be deaf by the credits!"" No joke, good lucky watching this at home. Keep the remote close by to balance the sound for the entire movie.
I was really looking forward to this, but found myself drowned in confusion. By all means watch it, simply so you can say ""oh yeah, that guy had a point..."""
212," Oppressively annoying constant suspense music, unrealistic acting, storyless.
","Music designed to add suspense is usually only played during a suspenseful scene. Here, almost the entire movie has repetitive suspense sounds (music?) in the background regardless of what's actually happening.There's also an unreal feeling about it. Large groups of people that would be talking (or yelling) and doing stuff in reality are somehow often silent and immobile. A lot of the communication is calm tones even though it's a war - urgent, hugely scary, life-threatening.There isn't much story - although I'm not sure if that was the intent. Instead it just jumps between a handful of totally separate characters pretty much randomly, and it jumps way too frequently for any sense of continuity.And then there's quite a few inconsistencies. Can't list here without declaring this a spoiler, though.The aesthetics / atmosphere does seem suitable for what's going on, though.Unless you're into weirdly produced arty movies that are all atmosphere, this shouldn't really appeal."
213," Where were the 400,000 men on a beach
","I cant conclude that this was a masterpiece or an epic - it most certainly wasn't - There are a few reviews on here that match my sentiment - the editing was poor several stories come together but are done almost ad hoc with a scene being almost a flashback to a previous scene where a plane that was shot down is then shot down again as part of a different story within the same story (if that makes sense). I watched the 1958 version of Dunkirk and it had more intensity than this the fear of the daily bombing and fear of drowning, fear of not getting off the beach alive - well that intensity was lacking in this there appeared to be a few hundred men on a beach who were occasionally attacked by 3 stucka dive bombers there were moments when you wanted something to happen and when it did you wondered what the hell it was about as there would be no dialogue. I felt like screaming what did you spend £150 millions on. It could have been so much more, special effects could have had thousands on a beach not a random selection of soldiers here and there there could have been more little boats coming towards Dunkirk. However, some things were done well the ship saving men and then only to be sunk again. Showing the desperation to survive and the cost of that survival. The spitfire scenes where we learnt something of what the RAF learnt in aerial combat that prepared them for the battle to come and the crew of the little boat and how they epitomised the spirit of Dunkirk - that was done exceptionally well but I was very disappointed about the rest and don't expect to see Oscars where there was little dialogue to deserve such."
214," Awful
","People got up and LEFTThis was about the most boring movie I've ever seen in my life, it was painful, I learned absolutely nothing about the story except that there were men, boats, and planes. And all of those things are portrayed in the most boring possible fashion. This is one of the biggest wastes of time and resources in film that I've ever seen.People just got up and left watching this film, ranging from pretty young to older folks. I don't blame them, wish I had done the same."
215," Hyped beyond imagination!
","For all the hype surrounding this movie, it was a dismal disappointment! I don't doubt for a moment that the battle for Dunkirk was grueling and tremendously heart-wrenching, nor do I diminish the sacrifices of those genuinely embroiled in this part of the war. The film lacks real continuity, genuinely embraceable characters, and ethos. In the entire film there were but 4 characters who even warrant the viewers' regard. The artistic panache of Kenneth Brannaugh is wasted in this drawn-out, mishmash of cinematography and monotonous soundtrack by Zimmer!War films, such as ""Gettysburg"", ""We Were Soldiers"" and ""Pearl Harbor"" tell episodes of war better than this celluloid catastrophe.God bless those who sacrificed their lives at Dunkirk. Your memories deserve far better than Nolan's self-aggrandizing ""epic""."
216," Perhaps The Most Underwhelming War Story Ever Told
",The evacuation of Dunkirk was one of the greatest achievements of WWII but you would not know it by this film. The story bounces around every few minutes to show another side of the story and becomes so disjoint that the episodes could be exchanged without altering the story line at all. The faces of the British soldiers all have that thousand yard stare and for the most part are expressionless. Not much to recommend this movie.
217," disappointed and at times bored
","I was so looking forward to seeing this film. While I can appreciate a different approach at this genre, I just didn't get it. The first half of the film was at times utterly boring. I struggled to stay awake. Things do get a bit better as the film progresses. At the end of the film I had such an empty feeling. After seeing classics such as Saving Private Ryan, the Pianist, Enemy at the Gates, etc. Dunkirk pales in comparison. Dunkirk reminds me a bit of the Blair Witch Project which was a new approach at the horror genre which was a total failure. At least the cinematography was good."
218," Worst warm film I have seen in years
","I can't think of a war movie worse, even if I try hard, wouldn't even watch this if it was on TV. The soundtrack left me with a headache after leaving the movie theater. Storyline goes absolutely nowhere. This film is supposed to be about a horrific war tragedy, but actually leaves you stranded with 8 planes 4 boats and 200 soldiers standing on a beach. The scenery was very bad, the movie only switches between three: (sea, sky and beach.)If Cristopher Nolan's intention was to leave you stranded on a beach with a shell shock headache and no look on the horizon he did a great job, otherwise this film is absolute nonsense."
219," Plot spoiler alert if there had been a plot. I don't understand the praise?
","I am a bit of a WWII buff so knew the story of Dunkirk going in. I can only imagine how lost a person not familiar with this chapter from history would be while watching this movie. Outside of a few lines of text at the beginning that provide an extremely brief bit of background info, there is zero explanation of what is happening so don't expect any sort of history lesson. It's kind of like a documentary that used all of its budget to create excellent reenactment footage but ignored the narration. Instead of a voice like David McCullough or Morgan Freeman to tell the tale, there is an annoying, overly loud, virtually continuous music score that instructs the viewer how to feel every single second. For a few scenes the director must have decided that loud manipulative music wasn't quite enough and elected to use dead silence instead. Frankly, my ears were so relieved during these precious quiet moments that any scene at all, another pan of the sky, another upturned face, a boot in seafoam would have triggered a tremendous emotional response.And yes, scenes are repeated. Remember when you first saw the trailer? When the cold, grey, ominous sky; cold, grey, ominous beach, and c.g.o. water made you feel almost as if something ominous was going to happen? Well, if you appreciated all of that great dreary English Channel atmosphere in the trailer you are in luck because the one thing Dunkirk succeeds in is establishing an ominous, dreary atmosphere. It's kind of a miracle how minutes and minutes of panning clouds, water, and beach don't begin to get old until about 45 minutes in. That's about the point when you sneak a look at your watch and realize that nothing more is going to happen. At my first watch look I was still hopeful and subtracted 35 minutes for previews which still gave the movie time to, you know, start moving. By my third time check I found myself wishing that I had paid A LOT more attention to one of the young dark headed guy's garbled words during the first ten minutes because I was starting to worry that I had missed something drastically important to the plot. But it turned out I hadn't missed anything more important than determining what was going on in any of the three, non-linear, confusing story arcs. Dunkirk follows the separate stories of a soldier, a sailor, and a pilot who are just trying to get home during war. Except for the pilot, who glides his plane down on the wrong shore. And except for the sailor who takes his children into known danger because he already lost one son to the war and loses another son on the journey but doesn't seem to mind. But these lads might not even be his children. I either forgot or it somehow slipped by me in the 50 or so spoken words that I actually understood. Regardless, I liked the sailor character the best by far, if only for the fact that he had the lead speaking role.At the end, the director predictably juxtaposes the bleakness of the beach at Dunkirk to the colorful landscape of the English countryside to suggest that the war is behind the dark headed soldier guys. And as one of them reads aloud from a newspaper about how silly their mission was, their countrymen somehow know that the newspaper is wrong and welcome them home with drink. Oh, he also reads part of Churchill's famous, ""We will beat them on the beach,"" speech in what might be the most awkward style ever recorded. I assume this was done to hammer home the fact that young men who go to fight in our wars are just simple, uneducated fellows. But really, I have no idea. This movie might be deceitfully deep or just a collection of nicely filmed war images. I left the theater not knowing a single character's name, not caring the slightest about any of the characters, and not able to even coherently describe what happened. It was like retelling a fading dream that seemed to have narrative and importance but only images and atmosphere remain.What is even more astounding, but to my great relief, I couldn't even remember enough of the nonstop, blaring score to hum a single bar. SUMMARY: If you've never seen a war movie you might be very impressed by Dunkirk's power. Or, judging from the positive critical reviews, you might have seen all of the major war movies and still be impressed. I honestly have no idea. POSITIVES: *Great attention to atmosphere and mood *Great cinematography *Probably will get people interested in learning about Dunkirk and WWII *Reaffirms that war is bad *Does not rely on gratuitous violence *Might be the only realistic war movie of the past 30 years that could be appropriate for kids *Story is told from a creative, non- traditional p.o.v. NEGATIVES: *Boring *Repetitive *Is basically a silent movie outside of the ear shattering score and sound effects *Incomprehensible narrative *Zero character development *Zero historical context *The score ODD INCLUSION: *I get that the director wanted to show that war is hard on the regular people who are involved. And I get that fear is hard on the bowels. But TWO pooping scenes/references within the first five minutes?? COMPARISONS: *The movie ""Carol"" which was long on atmosphere and got critical acclaim but was a lazy snooze-fest"
220," Bad, Bad, Movie
","As a combat veteran and a watcher of dozens of historical based war films, I must be brutally honest. This is a boring and very slowly presented film. As all historical based films are, we already know the ending, which automatically takes away one third of our viewing interests. The film simply shows thousands of soldiers and sailors, standing on a beach or dock ,waiting to be bombed or shot at by German Aircraft. Several people in the theater got up and walked out. Based on my respect for the poor souls of the actual Dunkirk, I remained to the end. I really had to stretch my forgiveness, to give it a three."
221," Dunkirk: A movie without a plot based on a story well known....
","When a movie is based on actual historical content, it's hard not to go into it without having certain expectations. From what I knew on the battle of Dunkirk, I was expecting a gripping story on the heroic effort and sacrifices made by the French Army on the defensive line to keep the Germans at bay long enough for hundreds of thousands of British and Allied troops to escape; to live to fight another day and win the war. I was expecting to be awed by a true appreciation for the grand scale of evacuating hundreds of thousands of soldiers under enormous pressure. And while I understand going into a movie with high expectations isn't always a good idea, it's hard not to expect anything less than an impressive story, particularly when you know that story is true.Although the movie had initially appeared to be ready to deliver on these expectations, it didn't take me very long at all to realize that, sadly, Dunkirk would ultimately fail to deliver on any of it.There were no battles on the defensive line and air battles were portrayed in this film in a way that made German pilots seem like unworthy adversaries; easier to shoot down than ducks in an Atari video game. The film also fell disappointingly short on portraying the true scope of the operation. I've seen longer lines of people waiting to buy the new iPhone than the lines of soldiers portrayed on the beaches awaiting evacuation.I had found it disappointing that 20 minutes into the film I was still wondering what the plot was on a story I was already familiar with. The lack of dialog was also so obvious and overdone that I had started to grow annoyed by it.In the end, I was left wondering why this movie received so much hype and such high ratings. The only possible explanation I could provide is that there must be an awful lot of people out there who like to analyze movies scene by scene, in a DIY director's cut fashion, so that they can offer an interpretation on what they think the director is trying to portray though his artistic creativity, because these high ratings seem to have absolutely nothing to do with this actually being an entertaining movie.Director Christopher Nolan seemed too lazy and bothered to even halfheartedly attempt to deliver on anything that made the battle of Dunkirk so historically significant, choosing instead to focus far too much on creating some new kind of Tarantino/Pulp Fiction-esque piece of story telling that Hollywood elites and snobby critics can adore him for."
222," Over Hyped movie
","Someone has to say it. Yes, its an an absolutely over rated movie. Only music by Han Zimmer is excellent. Cinematography is good that's it. Yes you do feel bad for people who is died in the war, hence people feel guilty criticizing a movie like this. To be honest movie has no soul whatsoever."
223," What's all the fuss? Not so good.
","For one thing, it was scaled back too much. In reality, Dunkirk was a huge battle involving the evacuation of around 400 thousand men. Hundreds of planes and ships were lost. Thousands of men died. The movie failed to convey the magnitude at all. We see a few planes dog fighting instead of hundreds. We see a few ships and boats sunk instead of hundreds. We follow one character around throughout the movie and it was boring. I really can't say I liked this movie. Great sound effects though."
224," Emporers new clothes
","Saw this at an imax cinema. Boy did the imax 'sound' ruin the talking. The dreary background noises generally drummed out the voices, even when there was no other action going on. There should also have been some quiet passages depicting just the sound of the waves as the soldiers took stock of their terrible plight. The film itself is a jumble of truncated scenes, sometimes repeated, that are not filmed very well. One scene ranged from day on the English side to night in France, then, for a minute, we had a storm only to never see it again. The characters are ridiculous and the lack of factual events is disappointing. This film would have us believe that 300,000 soldiers were evacuated from the beaches of Dunkirk by a single visit from a number of small fishing boats. Also, that 3 spitfires were enough to provide all the air cover that the soldiers needed. This film is so bad that people must be commenting on it based on their knowledge of the makers and actors involved, rather than what they saw and heard."
225," Save your money
","Seriously boring. Zero story line. Maybe 4 bits that are worth a ""meh"". Looks great though. Subplots that lack depth. Why was One Direction in it? Save your money, go watch something better than a thing that fanboys give a 10 out of 10 for a movie that's worth a high 4. I honestly would've preferred sticking chopsticks into my eyes than sit through this. Unfortunately I didn't have any chopsticks in the cinema."
226," This film is grossly overrated and boring, hence my one star review
","I would typically rate a film like this 4 stars, which is what it deserves, given that it lacks a plot, any sense of coherency and development, while also failing to get beyond the most superficial and basic summary of the story of Dunkrik. I am giving it one star because I am shocked at the high rating it currently enjoys, given its completely lazy script and disjointed direction. I am disappointed by C. Nolan, and I think he should stick to directing and stop writing scripts because they are awful. There is literally no meaningful dialogue in this film. If you like a contentless, dialogue-light, incredibly unintelligent film that has some nice shots of a dive bomber chasing and being chased on the beach in France, then this is for you. The film has such a severe shortage of dramatic content that it shows the same scene three times from different perspectives (the final scenes of the dive bomber chase) without really adding anything to the plot. Knowing a bit about the history of Dunkirk, after watching this film, it is safe to say that it tells the audience one thing about Dunkirk: there were 400,000+ soldiers trapped there by the Germans, and the British Navy rescued them with the help or requisitioned civilian vessels. I have watched an array of WWII films, from Saving Private Ryan, Letters From Iwo Jima, The Thin Red Line, Das Boot, Enemy At the Gates, and countless others. I have never felt the need to write a review for any of these films because I felt that their ratings were accurate reflections of their worth as films. I am writing this review, which is the first I have ever written on IMDb, because I am so outraged at the hype about this film, given that it was utterly vacuous and boring. As even the most generous reviewers have conceded, the film lacks characters, and thus lacks any real plot. Literally nothing seems to happen the entire film except for a few sailors and pilots being rescued--and one really long chase in the sky. There is absolutely no context given of why they were in Dunkrirk and how they were trapped. The entire drama surrounding Dunkirk, not to mention the massive military blunder made by Hitler at this front, was not only absent, but apparently actively ignored in this film. The film made a point of constantly switching from one scene to another and then back to the first (at certain points switching back and forth between four or five scenes that were only loosely connected to one another). Either people are getting more passive and sheep-like, simply following the lead of the critics who are undoubtedly invested in this film's success for reasons other than a genuine love of film, or they are becoming less intelligent, since this film is the definition of trash. I cannot believe that I read someone saying that this was the best film they saw in a decade. However, when the competition is the 6th installment of Spider-man, an overrated and overblown third installment of Planet of the Apes and other like-minded, mind-numbing agit-prop and trash. This entire review does not even get into the issue in the film surrounding its glorification of war, aesthetically, for the most part, but also dramatically (albeit at a very diminished level, given the lack of drama and character or plot development and depth in this film). The very origins of WWI and WWII lie in the callous and blind aestheticization of war, as in the proto-fascist futurist movement which produced poems glorifying war and modern machines of death. The scenes and feel of war are not adequately depicted in this film. It is far too much of a feel good flick to be realistic or even approach the boundary of realism. The entire film lacked the quality of feeling real, despite the director's desperate attempts to make it feel that way. Saving Private Ryan, despite some of its flaws, was far more gory and realistic than this film (I do not think you can make a realistic war film with battle scenes, especially of WWII without the level of violence that would warrant an R rating). In the end of the film, the soldiers go on a train the England and the train's interior looks like it is from the early 2000's or late 1990's at the earliest. It does not look like 1940's England. The film does not capture the audience through ideas or dialogue or history, but rather uses beautiful camera shots and crowd psychology to please and entertain. It lacks any critical attitude toward itself or the idea of representing war and destruction, and moreover, toward that of representing history in general. This film tells you just about what a knowledgeable four year old could say about Dunkirk: allies trapped by Nazis in Dunrkirk, and British RAF and Navy come to the rescue with the help of a few civilians. Really not compelling. How about showing the audience why Dunkirk even was part of the war? Or showing the local French population, or the Nazis who were invading? Or simply explaining the context in more than three lines at the beginning of the film. This script was lazy and amateur."
227," No plot, lack of dialogue and character depth
","From the start there is a lack of dialogue, you are thrown into action though which draws you in, however this soon fades and the action slows down and you are left wondering when the story itself is actually going to begin. Some say it's a beautiful film visually however as someone who knows a lot about WW2 and the scale of evacuation of Dunkirk it doesn't do it justice. Over 900 boats were used and both sides lost around 150 planes which is not portrayed well enough with a handful of ships and only 3 German and 3 English planes. I understand the director wanted to not use Cgi however without this I feel that the script, plot and character depth needs to be more engaging to keep the viewer interested. The subject matter of the film was the evacuation of Dunkirk, I would actually struggle to explain the plot/ storyline to somebody because it doesn't really have one.Overall I can see the director has tried to make a war film different from the rest, however for me this didn't work at all. Without an interesting plot, character depth or dialogue all you are left with are nice images which does not do enough for the viewer to really get a sense of emotion, and feel what the soldiers felt at the time."
228," It has been a very big disappointment and I think it could be the worst Nolan movie ...
","The shortcomings of the script and the story are:The scenario used in the film has a lot of gaps and is full of bullshit ...The film has a split screenplay but nobody tells you the name in the film and you do not understand who you are like in the form of actors and all the complexity ... There is no proper dialogue ...There's a lot of time shifts in the film ... The film goes in 3 days ...On the first day, we come from the street and try to board the ship as a fugitive. The next day the ships departed and evacuated. Arrival by train on the third and last day.They find Cillian Murphy, who sits on a sinking destroyer, by chance, who is killing someone on the boat, no one says to the man ""What are you doing?"" (I do not understand how it happened ... the child pushed down 3 steps and died.)However, the incident is so complicated and incoherent that I could not make any sense that these 3 days would always show the scene of the landing of the helicopter in each other ...There are 450 thousand soldiers waiting on the beach. Why are you confusing this story ... Are 450 thousand people waiting behind the beach for the enemy? It is not ridiculous!There was no resistance in the place where we were talking about the last sandy hill, and the Germans did not even bother to attack it, just bombarded it with a bunch of tank firepower and so on. (Because the German army has waited for 48 hours in reality but nobody tells it in the film, you are watching like an idiot.) ... But the German troops are firing occasionally ... According to your head, I can not decide what to do. This film, in the meantime they shoot firing in their heads ... because in that last scene they hold their dry cargo ship to the fire, or in the first scene ...He stayed in the air for almost 5-6 hours with the plane running out of fuel ... In the place where he could turn the plane like a friend and bring it down to the sea (next to the evacuation ships), the plane is lowering it in the enemy positions ... Shortly after the plane comes down two enemy soldiers come and arrest this man No opposing fire is opened when we go down to enemy positions ...There is this unfinished American masturbation event ... The British and the French have escaped but they have come to say that we have come to destroy them ...A very simple result was the end of the movie with the linking part, 30 boats arrived and dozens of soldiers took out the soldiers they could not get out and went ... 330 thousand people, 30 boats and they went and they did not tell anyone that the air crafts of the German aircraft do not ... The submarines were pert and there was no plane left ... Even if the submarine floated to the water surface and hit the boats, even killing 100 thousand people ... The child seemed to be tricked ... Okay, here we are, we are gone,If you are shooting a war movie like I said, you can not tell this story according to your head on the same front line because it is contrary to the topic you are talking about, because it is against the war because everyone is doing the same job ... There is no such thing as an enemy anymore. The film was ruined ... This story could be explained much better ... In other words, the story of a manga soldier could be more clearly understood and more beautiful than a story of a manga soldier. Divide it with lines ...Come on to shooting problems:I do not know if 2d den can be caused but it seems to me that the images are terrible ... The whole world does not have to watch this film in imax, but this technology exists in very few places ... 2d scenes are sometimes clear, sometimes fuzzy, sometimes (primary person ) ... There was a lot of incomprehensibility in there, and there was always a continuous event that jumped up there, so there was no clear event, and the continuous events are intermingling ...Nolan's ambiguity continued here as well. He did not always use the same method of shooting. For example, while looking at a person's eyes, the camera is constantly trembling, shaking according to the man ... For example, when the torpedo is in the camera the camera of the stimulant is not shaken, The same problems exist in many scenes in the cinema or in the divine view ... Especially in the jet scenes, while the camera is swaying with the vibration of someone's plane, there is no such problem on the other ...The biggest minus in terms of cinema is that the film starts with a narration and ends in the face of a flat-faced man who has to explain what it is at the end that this unacceptable is a mistake that these mistakes ruins the film ... How do you not tell them what happened or how many died or how many destroyers sink ... Scandal a mistake ..."
229," Horrible
","Walked out of the movie after watching it for an hour. The actors do not talk very much in the movie but it seems to have music playing in the background quit a bit. The movie went from one scene to the next to the next to the next, it kept jumping around so you never really get into liking one character or the other. It was a very slow movie and the War scenes were less graphic than what you see on regular T.V. I would rate this movie below a 1 if I could. Definitely the worst war movie I have ever seen. I have no idea how anyone would rate this movie better than Saving Private Ryan, Band of Brothers, or any other war movie. To sum it up, wait for it to come on DVD if you really want to watch it because I promise you that you will thank me for saving you money!"
230," Not my favorite war movie
","I was expecting way more from the movie based on the ratings (9/10 or 90% on most rating sites) at the time.Saving Private Ryan, Fury and Hacksaw Ridge did not even get ratings this high. Maybe I expected something else, but this was a rather inaccurate war drama."
231," A compete failure
","I was expecting a great war movie, but it happened to be a very disappointing and boring experience. A lot of repetitive scenes, a lack of depth, and a poor script. I would describe it as a documentary rather than a movie... Piece pf advice : for those who are expecting a war movie, don't get yourself fooled don't waste your money for such pity."
232," Dunkirk will age really badly.
","Dunkirk is Christopher Nolan out of depth and in uncharted waters. It's a movie that wants very hard to be great. Where characters talk in monosyllables and look meaningfully at each other or in the distance expecting the viewer to be with them in their moment. Going by the majority of the reviews, this British war survival story has been bought by a lot. I was sitting in the theater waiting for that moment of redemption in the movie that never really came. Critics, it seems have seen the movie and adapted their tastes to like it and find deeper meaning (as critics often do) in perhaps the most straightforward story line made interesting only because of the non-linear editing tropes which Nolan otherwise uses well in his other movies to some purpose. Here it becomes too much of a gimmick and some extremely non moving and non interesting events are made to seem more than what they are. What remains of Dunkirk is an aural and visual spectacle that falls squarely flat by the time the last of the British is rescued. The movie has multiple endings and at such a short run time, the ending can't come fast enough. Nolan has admittedly taken off from multiple movies before he made Dunkirk and his effort is different in the way it has such less impact even after bombarding the viewer with bullets, bombs and an overpowering Hans Zimmer soundtrack.Hoyte Van Hoytema is a brilliant cinematographer. The Spitfire is a brilliant machine (as mentioned by Nolan in many interviews and expressed by one of the characters in the movie.) The aerial photography is like no other you may have seen. But all of this amounts to nothing. The spitfire maybe a brilliant machine and Hoytema may have taken brilliant shots but the story line flounders away in the air somewhere. Tom Hardy can't see the plane clearly and after the 10th shot of the same plane meandering here and there you realize the war can be really tedious and boring without that pounding Hans Zimmer soundtrack at the background. Thanks Christopher Nolan for putting me right in the middle of the war with such lovely heart pounding score, because frankly the screenplay isn't your best bet here and you know it.I'll go on here and speculate now because I'm a fan of the man and want to. The man who doesn't seem to falter even when he makes a movie like The Dark Knight Rises as he infuses a lot of commentary and brilliance in the weakest of plots. Christopher Nolan has a very visible Stanley Kubrick hangover. He has a picture of Kubrick's chair in his office, he swears by Kubrick's brilliance and if you try and see there are quite a few similarities in the filmography of the British compatriots (Dunkirk being his Paths of Glory). Wanting to be the greatest and most complete filmmaker is the noblest of ambitions but wanting to be like someone else may not be. Before Dunkirk, he was a man who would blow your minds off with a plot twister like Memento or The Prestige, a mind bender like Inception or Following or his villains would have the most memorable roles like The Joker. Dunkirk is Nolan's 'war movie'. Every great director generally ends up making one and wants to make the greatest one. (No one comes close to the Thin Red Line and Apocalypse Now yet, IMO) Dunkirk makes me believe in Christopher Nolan the human director. This guy wanted to make his war movie and when I see it, this was a movie the world would be better off without. In these times of war and international strife, the movie shows you some of the horrors of the war while squarely glamorizing many aspects of it (""The Spitfire with the Rolls Royce engine is the greatest machine ever built."" Says the old guy to his Son in the movie.) I have read many Nolan interviews to find out what this important artist who wields great artistic influence the World over, thinks about what's happening in the World. His world views are unfortunately not much available in the interviews and going by Dunkirk, a patriotism filled British epic lauded by all the British and the colonial powers the world over, it's quite unfortunate that this is the movie we have to live with as the Best reviewed movie of the year. One watch is enough to tell you the movie is average at best and I can't make myself believe it's greater than it really is when it's squarely a technical achievement.Christopher Nolan is at the zenith right now as Dunkirk becomes his best reviewed film and may of course get an Oscar or two thanks to the technical brilliance. It remains his most manipulative and weakest story. A very flimsy plot made watchable thanks to the score and the camera.Dunkirk would age really badly and few years from now, may not even be considered in his best movies."
233," Watch the 1959 film for a better understanding of the event
","In 1990 I attended the 50th anniversary celebration of the event.We were fortunate to have veterans in our group who had been at Dunkirk.We went onto the beach and they recounted their experiences.None of them would appear to be similar to those shown in the film.I have to say that till I read some of the reviews that I realised that the action is non linear and some is repeated.Maybe that explains why the Spitfires kept on firing when in fact they only had 9 seconds worth of ammunition.In any event there were few RAD planes at Dunkirk as they were being withdrawn to England.Then we have the small boats.It seems to have been overlooked that they were originally sent over to ferry troops from shore to navy ships.It was only later in the evacuation that the boats ferried troops back direct to England.No French troops are shown on the beaches.In conclusion the film is overblown,noisy and inaccurate.So loud I had to take my hearing aids out of my ears. Watch the 1959 film instead of this."
234," The most boring war/Nolan movie ever
","When we hear of Nolan ..a war movie is not the first thing that comes to mind .His movies are the ones that are totally mind boggling .Leaves us with an open question at the end.Despite that he has delivered to us a war movie about the more unknown war or rather Allied retreat at Dunkirk.Yes move over US invasion of Normandy chaps ! its time for Dunkirk. The plot of the story, if there is any is mostly covered in the trailers.I understand this was a real incident and there is little room for theatrics when its presented by Nolan.Then again it gets too repetitive planes flying over one another , shooting each other down .Even the dialogues ""home..you can practically see it from here "" its 3 times in the movie.Yes i counted. You may watch it and like it if you are an ardent Nolan fan ,or a critic who is confused if he should right away disapprove a particular ""Nolan"" movie."
235," Bad movie that is emotional-less, heartless and stale.
","Dunkirk is a glorified History Chanel documentary. The movie is emotional- less, heartless and stale. Anyone saying otherwise is a Nolan slappie that would rave about him filming dogs pooping in a yard.The movie starts and throws you right in to dreary action. From there the entire run time is spent in jarring fashion that's meant to simulate being in an actual battle or being attacked. What it fails to do is be an actual film or tell any kind of tale. It's a two hour long dragout scene and not an actual movie. There is no real act structure so you can't even call the third act a failure.This thing shouldn't even be labeled a movie, just a two hour visual experiment on par with a Transformers level ""story"" or VR experimental cinema."
236," Bad
",You know this movie is really really boring I advice to just save you 10 box and 2 hours of your life. Rather watch paint dry because then you can at least understand the story of a paints life going from wet to dry. Time is can't be reversed so don't waist it on this movie!!!! I advice to just read a book about Dunkirk because then maybe you well be able to understand it better. Hope this helped you. Also the UK don't know how to make military movies at all at least the Americans make it interesting
237," You will be very sorry you went to see this. You've been warned.
","Two hours I'll never get back. Simply the worst film I can remember. The IMAX experience couldn't even save this stinker. I'm not entirely sure what I just watched. This film did a terrible job in its plot delivery. There was no character development at all. Nolan tried desperately and gambled in taking an eclectic approach to a war movie which ends up leaving the audience in a state of mass confusion. I hated it. I couldn't wait until the credits rolled so I could officially depart from the dumpster fire that this movie was. If you are expecting your typical heroes and villains war movie with cool battles and testosterone laden machismo, this is far from it. Dunkirk is a 2 hour expose of the mundane depressive state of war as if you were in it. Few action scenes. Little dialogue. Scattered confusing plot. Not sure how Nolan pitched the idea of having a de facto silent film World War II movie with no action or emotionally driven sub plot. You will be very sorry you went to see this. You've been warned."
238," Hans Zimmer cld have been better
","A great movie with respect to the cinematography and grandeur of the filming location. The movie captured the dread and hopelessness of the allied soldiers very well. Dialogue was at a minimum as the excellent visuals told the story. My only complaint is the extremely annoying musical score by Hans Zimmer. The continuous sawing against cello and violin strings were meant to increase the drama of the plot. But, it was repetitive and mindless and detracted from an otherwise great movie (it would have garnered at least a nine rating without the score). Hopefully, they can re-score the film someday. If so, it could be a classic."
239," Not about Dunkirk and certainly not an epic movie.
","Possible spoiler for content: I went to see the movie full of hope it might be another epic movie living up to its title ala ""Bridge Too Far"" or ""The Longest Day,"" but this movie was not about the evacuation of Dunkirk. It wasn't even a war movie, and anyone watching it would not know anything useful about the actual battle (that wasn't even an actual battle). First, the good: The graphics were well done, exceptional in fact. The pilot's eye view and shooting engagements were very good. The naval scenes when ships were hit, including interior scenes, were pretty well done as well. The larger vistas of the beaches were pretty good and copied from readily available historical footage. The movie's converging story lines of the three soldiers was well done, with the eavesdropping part giving a good entry for the general situation (aimed at audience members who don't know anything about the relevant history). A Ju-87 dive bombing attack at the beginning was pretty cool in giving audience members a chance to hear the notorious Stuka's siren.The bad: There was no real ""air to air"" per se--the German ME109s just flew in a nearly straight line acting like training drones for the British fighter pilots to shoot down. Inexplicably, instead of flying like fighters, i.e. at higher altitudes to maintain situational awareness and tactical superiority, everyone flew at sea level. German fighter bombers simply droned alone with escorts that apparently did nothing but get shot down for a chance to show the very good perspective shots. The occasional attacks on the beach were more for a look at an attacking plane, but really nothing else. The damage and effects of damage on people were superficial and not even close to reality, and there was no impression of the tremendous amount of equipment held by the British. Troops stood by the water in company sized lines waiting for ships that were not even visible, and no attempt was made to prepare for anti-aircraft response with rifles or shore batteries. Several scenes of the evacuation showed (or you heard) the impact of incoming artillery fire, but not one ship fired counter battery fire. The actors were all very pretty boy-models, except in one pretty lame subplot where the ""bad guy"" Brit had a slightly meaner set of eyebrows. In this scene, a squad of soldiers abandoned their unit and hid in a beached boat without the slightest sense of tactical or situational awareness, and hid. While hiding in the hull of the boat and awaiting the tide, during which time no one set up a guard or made any preparations to use the craft, some rifle/machine gun fire began hitting the boat's hull, creating holes that began allowing water to leak into the boat. Somehow, despite hitting the metal hull of the boat and not exiting, none of these rounds ricocheted or hurt anyone. The undisciplined group panics and begins to wonder how to lighten the boat so it won't sink. During this part, the ""ugly"" guy threatens to off a disguised French soldier so that his riddance would make the boat somehow more sea worthy.In short, this was not a movie about Dunkirk, but a drama centered about a few soldiers, a couple of pilots--all of runway good looks, and a civilian boat owner with a veneer of early WWII and a backdrop of Dunkirk that would only fool or engage someone knowing little to nothing about the actual history of crisis. It certainly wasn't a thriller or realistic, and it was nowhere near ""epic."" But the excellent CGI, coupled with a real story ala ""Bridge Too Far"" construct, could have contributed to an outstanding movie."
240," Run Far Away!!!
","Please please save 2 hours of your life and NEVER watch this overrated piece of garbage. I like Nolan as much as the next guy but this movie lacked everything!!! Terrible script, overly focused on boring mini stories involving basic characters with little to no appeal. By 60 min in I was rooting for the bad guys haha!!! This is easily one of the most overhyped movies of the decade.

243," Dunkirk (2017, Chris Nolan)
","I got to see this film in the IMAX theatre which is really by far the best way as unlike most other films that use IMAX cameras to heighten portions of the presentation, this one is almost all in the larger IMAX format with only a few dialogue scenes reverting back to the more traditional widescreen format. This is the story of allied soldiers from Belgium, the British Empire and France who are surrounded by the German army and evacuated during a fierce battle in World War II.The story is told from several points of view and it chops rapidly between them at a break-neck speed. I think Chris Nolan has taken on board some of the criticisms of past films for over waffling and un- needed length as this one is edited tight as a drum. Some may say there are not enough character moments but I feel there were enough to tell the story effectively. My grandfather was captured in this region during this time and was a prisoner of war for the remainder of the campaign. It is not lost on me what kind of hell these men went through and this film delivers that feeling. The score is amazing as was the sound design and I will be expecting Oscar nominations for both. I will reserve judgement till i see how it fairs on the home format without the IMAX treatment on whether it is Nolan's best film to date but it might bloody well be. 8/10"
244," Batman Soundtrack in a WWII Film?
","After seeing previews showing authentic WWII aircraft, I thought ""Wow,"" and couldn't wait to see this in our IMAX. While the visuals were indeed superb, I found the ""Batman"" like dramatic soundtrack intended to ramp up the viewers anxiety levels during intense battle scenes overwhelming. This effect was used throughout the movie and in my opinion was completely unnecessary and became progressively annoying as the movie played on. Frankly, I think the action sequences were sufficiently thrilling alone, where including an instrumental soundtrack only served to distract the viewer from any sense of the realism portrayed on screen. It's unfortunate that Christopher Nolan choose to portray this event in a ""Batman"" like dramatic setting.I did feel the movie was entertaining, but not nearly the caliber of a ""Saving Private Ryan"" quality as I was hoping for. There are several stories playing out, leaving insufficient time for character development to the extent needed to make you really care about anyone in particular. There were also a couple of action sequences that strained credibility if you are a WWII realist, but fortunately not so many that it came off as a ""Rambo"" type film.I think most will enjoy it as an above average WWII offering with great visuals. With a few tweaks, it could have been much better though."
245," Potential, but it didn't deliver
","As someone who's very much interested in history, watching this movie was a nobrainer. The trailer looked promising and got me pretty hyped up. That being said however, the trailer is the only thing good about this movie.30 minutes into the movie and I was barely paying any attention to it anymore. It even got as bad as me starting a conversation with my neighbour who shared my opinion about this movie being a snoozefest. Turns out me and my neighbour shared the same holiday destination every year.Oh Right, the movie... even the action scenes were boring. It didn't even try to convey the desperation of the evacuation; just drop a bomb now and then and make the soldiers faceplant the beach when it happens.No sorry the movie completely missed the boat... ha ha ha...ha.. get it? Because dunkirk?"
246," Noise level is dangerously loud - take hearing protection
","The soundtrack on this film is so loud that it is physically painful. People with me said that their chairs were rocking at certain points. I put my fingers in my ears and after I left the theatre, my ears were ringing. I happen to carry a sound meter with me and it constantly was registering 90+ decibels -- that is power tool level.As someone else commented, an aircraft cannot fly without fly, the one in this film glided around during daylight and ended landing in the dark -- ridiculous. This is not a film that is anything other than painfully noisy. Don't waste your money."
247," very disappointing
",heard the buzz for this movie and just was so disappointed. the movie starts not even referring to the Germans or Nazis but called them the enemy oh my goodness sanitizing of history strike one. I watched and was shaking head on the continuity as one scene would have night and then go to day and the strange pacing for the tom hardy character as one scene is battling the Germans on limited gas and an hour later he is still flying and lands what the heck. plus this is a war zone but the horrors of fighting also are sanitized with pc sanctimony I was bored watching as one never can feel a connection with the characters which is something I noticed in the wonderful era of war movies of the 1960's as in that period all major actors seemed to be in the military which gave a certain gravitis to their performances in this movie all performances are hollow and unengaging.
248," A technical marvel without human emotions
","In a scene, Tom hardy saves thousands of lives by making a fighter plane go down to ashes. But the scene had no impact on me as an audience. This is in fact the problem with this aesthetically perfect movie. We do not feel for the soldiers at any point of time. Hans Zimmer's soundtrack is overused to such an extent that the focus goes to the music score instead of the visuals. Dunkirk could have done so any things right just by having a higher run-time. In 100 odd minutes, the movie just, don't move us. It had all the perfect components for a movie that would remain in our hearts for times to come, but getting out of the cinema hall, only the burger I had in between remained with me. Not the best Nolan film Not the best war film Not even the best film of the year"
249," A Spectacle in Search of a Story
","The most remarkable about Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk is that he entirely missed the whole story of Dunkirk which was about these tiny private boats, thousands of them, piloted by citizen-sailors rescuing hundreds of thousands of cornered British troops. This became a huge rallying point for the Brits before the Blitz when ordinary Britons actually saved 270,000 men. For most of Nolan's Dunkirk he focuses on Mark Rylance who appears to be out in the middle of the English Channel all by himself. In reality, the private fleet was a massive flotilla. If you live on the west coast of the US, imagine every private boat in LA Harbor, Long Beach and Newport emptied into the Catalina Channel. That's what Dunkirk was like. Where are all those CG effects when you really need them? Instead, Nolan seems more interested in effects that show troop transport ships being torpedoed and breached which is NOT the real story of Dunkirk. And that's not saying anything about Cillan Murphy's pointless flashbacks or Tom Hardy's silly Hollywood RAF pilot who shoots down German fighters without fuel or an engine. If you judge a film by the actual events that inspired it this is not inspired work - just another bloated CG spectacle with an over-mixed soundtrack, a much advertised 70mm picture, and in selected theaters, vibrating seats. Seriously. In that sense, Dunkirk is not a bad IMAX film - if only it were an hour shorter. If you want to see a good Dunkirk film, dig up the Dunkirk from 1958 with John Mills. A far superior piece of cinema."
250," Over-bored
","Over-hyped and over-budgeted this emperor's new clothes of a film is expensively but far from seamlessly stitched together. No character development or back story whatsoever so impossible to care about any of the protagonists, no cinematic grandeur and literally not a German to be seen ( probably a clever metaphor which like many of the bombs and bullets in the film went over my head ). Perhaps suffering from it's 12A rating the beach massacre was far too clinical and lacking in realism, explosion after explosion followed by soldiers simply getting up and immediately standing back in the ' sea' queue or playing dead, no one injured, screaming, bloodied or even limping slightly or sucking on a sore finger. The toe-curling shoe-horned incident of the Enid Bilghton caricatured thick kid fatally falling down two steps of a boat ( curiously the one place there was an actual suggestion of blood, but not much ) seems like a clumsy afterthought. At least we can depend on Tom Hardy to single handily knock those Gerry bombers and fighters for six, even with not a drop of fuel in his kite then, land beautifully on the German held beach and, avoiding their towels, get out, blow up his plane and standing rather dangerously close for my liking( of course he is very brave must have known it was safely out of ammo by now ) watch it burn whilst waiting stoically to be taken prisoner, no doubt to fight another day."
251," Unworthy
","Clumsy editing, poor character development, and a lack of historical basis make this one of the worst war films to come along in recent years.What WW2 films did I like best? In no particular order - The Longest Day, a Bridge too far, A Walk in the Sun, Hell in the Pacific, The Great Escape, Saving Private Ryan, Bridge over the River Kwai, Attack, Hangmen Also Die, The Dirty Dozen, Kanal, Das Boot, Run Silent Run Deep, etc."
252," Dunkirk is confused and I am sure it is not a MOVIE.
","Okay so I just returned home after watching Dunkirk and I have I was so wrong,Hahn Don't know how to say this but billions of blue blistering barnacles what the F@@K did I just saw. This is not a Christopher Nolan movie it had nothing of him in this movie in fact I am not even sure if it was a movie at best it's a WW2 situation shown on a high budget History channel world war episode. I am not swayed by anyone's review so I am going to give my Unbiased Spoiler free review of DUNKIRK.Okay the opening scene is awesome and it gets you the background score is getting chilling and you are now in Christopher Nolan Zone and then 15 minutes goes by and music is still building on and before it reaches the climax there is suddenly change of scene!! Why?? And the same things go on in a loop throughout the movie. Its just starts to get frustrating. Just for everyone benefits Dunkirk is bit like Memento which tells the same episode through different character eyes in a Time lapse/ Wrap mode and this time it is not executive well.You have to pay attention to starting 10 minutes to get what's going to happen the incidents will be shown through 3 different angels – Soldiers on land, pilots in the sky and sailors on the boat and by far the best shots are from the sky and no one gives damn about soldiers and of course since it's a sea movie you have lots of ships and one very irritating rescue boat. Now here is the most confusing part of this movie, you see many big ships sinking yet you start to realize no damn it, it's the same ship sinking over and over again!! I mean the same episode is being shown by three different group of people.in Dunkirk defense it has some truly state of the Art Dog fight scene in the sky and they are shot Gorgeously well and its the only saving grace of the movie and yet in the end of the movie that moments are also taken away from you.Dunkirk is not a movie it's a episode at best there are no characters and the best one never shows his face and I have no idea if Christopher Nolan does not like Tom Hardy Face but he refuse to give him face time on on the screen, he is always in some kind of mask. I Think even if every Englishman write brave reviews about Dunkirk it will still not save this huge high budget ship from sinking , it has Titanic written all over it. I am not sure if CN directed this movie or some one from his assistant team did it. The film has some very serious editing issues and narration is all over the place. The Music has same tone in every seen and hence we will never have ""No time to Caution"" moment in this movie.For me this movie has failed in all levels, even Hacksaw ridge is far better war movie than this one but the problem is Hacksaw understand it is a movie Dunkirk is confused and I am sure it is NOT."
253," Hype train that hits the buffers
","It's hard to imagine where the $100million budgeted for this film was actually spent. Perhaps on the stellar cast, Tom Hardy, Mark Rylance, Cillian Murphy to name a few. All superb actors but in this, are completely muted and devoid of impact. I couldn't tell one floppy haired actor from another. To be fair, it wasn't their fault as the script was basically a lazy copy and paste from everything that has come before, just that it was the abridged version. Whilst the scenes aboard ships were tightly packed with personnel, when the camera panned , the beaches were clear from horizon to horizon, interspersed with some burning oil drums to give the timid illusion of a war zone rather than Margate in November. Though some subscribe to the idea that less is more, in this instance, less is less. Compared to the BBC's 2004 three part series Dunkirk, this fails in every quarter. Like wine, sometimes it's crap even if you paid £80 for the bottle, despite how much you want it to be good."
254," Very Very Disappointed
","I was so spectacularly disappointed with this film and found so many areas of its story just so badly executed. Its so sad to see how films like this create an almost placebo like effect with movie goers falling over themselves to describe them as being the most breathtaking cinematic events they have ever seen when in reality they are just simply passable. Why am I saying this? I feel that Christopher Nolan failed in an almost epic scale to show the true scale of men, machines and vessels that were on those beaches during the evacuation. At no time did It feel that there were anymore than 500 men on the beaches and this itself was so poor and ineptly executed. If this film had been made 30 years ago by a seasoned director then there would have literally been 4000 extras used to create the atmosphere and cinematography required, and yet this film just relied on some CGI of a few hundred?There were several scenes that seriously made absolutely no sense for example hundreds of men all lined up on the jetty in possession of their rifles ( 303 Lee Enfields ) and when the inevitable German Stuka bomber made its way towards them on a bombing run all of them (apart from one bloke) instead of aiming their hundreds of rifles towards the air and at least giving something back to the enemy before their fates were sealed, they all just decided to duck and hold their tin hats? It was just stupid and not a human response in conflict. There were no rudimentary light machine gun positions with Bren guns to provide any form of token anti-aircraft screen and it was just really really poor. Im not looking for the film to be some gung ho war film but it deserved to be realistic and it wasn't.Kenneth Brannaghs role in the film felt was under whelming and just didn't work. I found his acting his usual one dimensional self when playing an historical British figure although the one he played in this was just a fictional character. Again Nolan invented parts of the story as at no point did any Sea Lord or Admiral set foot on the beaches to either orchestrate or pass on instructions or messages, this again showed just how weak the story-telling was.I found the idea that there were only three Spitfires available on that given day just stupid and again resembled nothing like what actually happened.The way the story jumped around and Cillian Murphys slight back story ( one scene from when he was picked up ) was again poorly handled and just didn't work.Again the director spectacularly failed to impress upon us the true scale of what it was like to be there and also at the end the actual number of small crafts that were involved. The scene where Mark Rylance looks across the horizon at a gaggle of no more than 30 boats was just totally underwhelming.The scenes where the soldiers go onto the beached trawler was quite frankly non-sensical, were the British soldiers practicing their marksmanship and if so why??? Bearing in mind the last thing any troops who had just been in combat for the past few weeks would be needing to do whilst sat on a beach waiting for rescue was to worry about re-zeroing their weapons?? Or was it the advancing Germans? Again why would German troops be looking at practicing their marksmanship skills when they were already in contact and about to re-engage with the enemy? The whole trawler thing was just so inept especially when the troops only decided to get out of it when it was literally submerged?For anyone who even in passing studied the Dunkirk evacuation this film was an utter mess but even worse it really failed to honour the story and the lives of those involved.There is a terrible lack of talent in film making these days, people don't dare question such films and like sheep just follow the hype...."
255," Brexit
","Ever since its release, Dunkirk has garnered more than the usual share of column inches granted a movie in the UK press. I can only assume that it has a special resonance for the English audience. Maybe it's all tied into Brexit, and other things that many Americans don't understand.I for one don't understand how British GIs, who'd been serially defeated by their adversaries, and had been on the run for over a month, could maintain their schoolboy haircuts and find time to shave every day. The English equivalent of Hollywood's Central Casting must have been pressed into service: The BEF appears to have been an army of heartthrobs, so much so that halfway through I figured the movie was produced with a gay audience in mind.The retreating Brits must have had an extraordinary quartermaster, because the Tommies sport uniforms with nary a tear or a smudge. Although I can't claim any combat experience, my overall impression is that people bleed when they're shot, and that battlefields resemble smelly junkyards littered with body parts. In Christopher Nolan's vision of war, even the dead are well-groomed. One might think that following media coverage of terrorist attacks, audiences would be bemused at the sight of cadavers that looked like the undertakers had just finished getting them ready for the viewing. That PG-13 rating must require an awful lot of sanitizing.And who, may I ask, kept the Germans at bay so the BEF could evacuate? You'd never guess it from the movie. It was the much-maligned French army; maybe even worse led than that of their ally's. Casualties were heavy among those left behind. After a particularly brutal march to Trier, Germany, survivors spent the next five years as POWs or forced laborers.The genuine heroism of the little guys who piloted their boats across the channel is sadly rendered mawkish by wooden performances and painful clichés. And the CGI that several reviewers rave about looked to me like cartoons; in fact, the whole feature has an animated feel. Toward the end of the movie, my mind wandered, and a rogue thought conjured up memories of Rob Reiner's This is Spinal Tap, in particular the bit where narrator ""Marty DiBergi"" describes the faux heavy metal group as one of England's loudest bands. If there's an Oscar for decibels, then Dunkirk is a shoo-in."
256," I also love Nolan, but I refuse to let that be a factor in my decision
","The movie started like a good movie could've started. Very slow paced and didn't really give much. I really like beginnings like that though as it adds tension and mystique. But throughout the second half of the movie I thought I was seriously being pranked. I could only come to the conclusion that the cinema, the director or God (I'm an atheist) was pointing a camera at me and filming my facial reactions as the movie progressed to later laugh at it.When you watch a movie made from Christopher Nolan, that has a stellar reputation of directing top 250 IMDb movies, you expect nothing less from Dunkirk. Instead Nolan took a 180 turn from what he has previously done, what he in my opinion is best at, and made this emotionless, insanely expensive and straight out lame movie, that I just was begging to end.But the real and only reason I am writing this (went on to recover my password to write my first and only review) is because of all you guys calling this a ""masterpiece"". I just can't understand how this is happening again. First it was Gravity, and now Dunkirk. It's like you fail to grasp the concept of a movie which, yes, is a great plus if made realistic, but it must contain some kind of PLOT. This movie had nothing remotely close to a plot, much less a twist, which naturally makes the movie dull, empty and simply not a movie but a documentary at best.I'm guessing the next over-hyped movie will be filming a guy for a week doing absolutely nothing special, that barely talks and then let's also pointlessly mix up the time-line to make it extra confusing so you call it a masterpiece because it represents reality? It's tiring guys. Firstly because you made me waste money, and also because you simply cannot move your a**es to look out the window if you now crave reality in it's purest form so much.1/10 because of the hype 4/10 movie (for the effort and time it must have taken and because Nolan somehow managed to get this out into the public)Jeez."
257," Missing a story and its historical mystery
","I so looked forward to seeing Dunkirk but sadly I concur with the negative reviews. I feel I must add my voice to counter the majority.I want to add the following in addition to my main objection - the overblown incessant sound really hurt and prevented me from appreciating any of its parts.The story of Dunkirk - how it came about and its evacuation are fascinating and historically intriguing but sadly none of this was brought out. Dunkirk did not provide context to the battle as it unfolded even confusing what little story there was with oddball editing, e.g., day and night times bounced around.Dunkirk had a chance to explore why the Germans did not attack to fully destroy/capture the allied troops which by all accounts they could have fairly easily done. There was one reference in the movie when it was mentioned almost in passing that the the German tanks simply stopped their forward motion but nothing was said about why or even wonder why. I have read of possible reasons concerning Hitler's order not to destroy the expeditionary forces but now with the perspective of over 70 years this should have been included as the key missing piece of this story.I gave Dunkirk a rating of 4 instead of 1 because of its visual production value but I am being generous."
258," Beautiful cinematography but still left me cold..
","As expected of a Christopher Nolan movie, Dunkirk has beautiful cinematography. I enjoyed the sometimes dizzying shots of the airplanes and the ocean but it made me appreciate the range of filming. However the movie itself was devoid of a plot. I understand Nolan was aiming for a movie geared towards survival of the soldiers, but I was not particularly moved by their struggles. The plot was too scattered for me. For instance, I was under the impression that the movie started out with ""the mole"", which was later referenced to, but never followed up on, which confused me very much as to what they were aiming for in terms of the story line. The fighting scenes were drawn out WAY too much and could have easily been cut down by 30 minutes so that I didn't have to watch 2 hours of essentially nothing. Also, the pounding music was suspenseful in the beginning but eventually began to hurt my ears.Also, as a side note,I later read on the actual events on Dunkirk and learned that Indian soldiers had a significant contribution in the events at Dunkirk, as they were a colony under the British Raj at that time. Nolan claimed that he didn't want to politicize the movie, but I don't understand how not including Indian soldiers would have politicized the movie. Thus it gave me the impression that in spite of beautiful graphics, I was yet again watching another stereotypical movie with white people saving the day during a war at the core of the movie, while pushing aside the contributions of other people. It might not matter to a lot of people but I would have personally liked to see SOME historical accuracy, along with a better stitched plot to keep me more engaged *yawn*"
259," Perhaps the ""ART"" of war should be left to Sun Tzu
",Talk about putting the bore in war! I saw Dunkirk's extended preview trailer in the Imax Hubble theatre and was excited by the tension presented by the fighter pilot scene as well as the scenes cutting in between. That was as good as this film got . A half hour to forty five minutes in I felt myself wanting it to be over and fast. Sweeping shots of the ocean and a high-powered tension building score were not enough to salvage this incredibly dull movie. The film is loaded with no name characters. It has plenty of stars just the characters you will identify as the guy who was burying the guy A multitude of character's scattered in different situations that you can not identify and by the time that you realize who is who you will not care as you will be begging for it to be over.From a cinematic standpoint Dunkirk may get high marks but it is not entertaining at all. An incredibly dull of a summer movie. So boring it was funny my friends and I laughed in the parking lot afterwards about how sufferable a sit thru this was and how badly we'd been had going to see it.
260," Could have been great .... over rated by the Nolan lovers
","I've now spoken with 4 other people who saw this movie and all of them felt the same way. I know how much of a darling Christopher Nolan is to the film critics. That said, without going into a long detailed account of this movie I'll just say this.This is a movie that could have been a great movie but wasn't. At the end of this movie you will not remember one character's name. (It's hard to remember what you never knew to begin with.) You will not know how many civilian boats came to the rescue of the trapped soldiers. You will not know how many civilians lost their lives trying to save the soldiers. You will not really know why or how the trapped soldiers ended up on the beach to begin with. You basically will have seen a few action scenes that take place on or near the beach at Dunkirk. That's it. REALLY! No story was told. No emotions get stirred or are touched.It would have been better if they had included information prior to the end credits. It would have helped if they had shown actual photos or video from the actual rescue, maybe include real survivors ... and on and on.Another frustration was the difficulty understanding the limited amount of dialogue, due to the never ending loud music. At the beginning I was wishing for subtitles. Then I realized that whatever they were saying was inconsequential. If this movie had been silent, I'd have left feeling the same way.This is a shallow, visually entertaining snippet of what could have been a good movie. Whereas with Quenton Tarantino, you wish his films were edited to remove an hour from them, with this movie it's just the opposite. You wish the director had told the story of Dunkirk rather than show a few action scenes of what it might have been like to have been there."
261," Not What I Thought It Was Going to Be.
","This was one of the biggest movie buildups of the summer. Before I went to see it I was picturing a Dunkirk version of Saving Private Ryan with realistic war scenes around a set of characters that you got to know and care about, and followed them through some type of struggle.If you separated each scene from the movie they were visually fantastic. But, when you put them all together you still had only a series of great looking clips, not an engaging movie. The lead characters were virtually indistinguishable from the other 400,000 soldiers. You never got to know them as individuals, so it had no impact when something happened to them. Nothing was ever explained, so if you don't know the historical context you still won't know the significance of the event, or even what really happened after you see this movie.I've seen much more interesting and clear documentaries on TV. If you are going to this movie expecting it to be the next big thing, you will likely be disappointed."
262," As if watching a movie on a very tight budget - boring, incorrect, soulless
","I don't remember watching a movie this bad in a long time. And that comes from a Nolan fan *and* a ww2 fanatic. I have no idea why this movie is hyped as it is, but there was very little that attracted me to the movie.1) Throughout the movie a total absence of scale is prevalent. You never have the feeling that Dunkirk was about 400,000 men crammed in a relatively small section of coastline. Empty, if anything, is the only word that describes most of the movie.2) An unhealthy amount of recycling of the same locations makes the movie feel cheap. Most shots are framed in such a way that you never really get to see much beyond the absolutely necessary. The inside of a boat, a little cross section of a cruiser, a very close-up zoomed image of a pilot in a cockpit that doesn't even shake or show any signs of noise or discomfort. The same little stretch of beach with the exact same docking cranes features in various scenes - always the same angle, the same distance.3) The dialogue is weak. Unnatural, sometimes almost as if part of more takes of dialogue that were removed later on. Short, abrupt, without conviction. Never feeling the tension as a reason to not talk. Or excessive boredom. Or sleep. No, it just feels like the characters didn't really have a soul.4) The actors were generic and poorly chosen. They didn't feel like they were really unified with their character. Many of them looked alike and that's about as deep as we go.5) There is a lot of ""time stretching"" going on in this movie. Things that would last 30 seconds or a few minutes in real life last an hour and a half in the movie. There is so little information to tell, so few scenes, boats, airplanes and so little story telling going on that they made every tiny accomplishment or happening last almost throughout half the movie, bit by bit, ""interwoven"" (and that is a word that makes it sound better than it is) with each other. But boring in the end.6) The total lack of historical accuracy bothers me. It's not that Nolan has so much wrong in broad lines. No, it's quite accurate (also because he doesn't have much to tell, it seems). But the horrible depiction of for example the stranded fishing boat scene. After the first set of holes shoot up the hull, the soldiers are fighting among themselves ""who needs to leave the boat to make it lighter"". WHILE STANDING CHEST-DEEP IN WATER. Really, 70 kilos will make a difference when standing in 5-6 tons of floodwater?Or the spitfire. Which flies at around 100 meters altitude, loses it's engine power but glides for seemingly forever.And forever. And forever. And then some. Just the actual seconds of flight time and the portrayed speed means it would have basically flown a dozen kilometers. But ...of course, it still ended up at the same tiny stretch of beach, same cranes in the background. Jesus.7) CHEAP. I just can't put my finger on it, but the entire movie just feels ""lower budget"" than what I expected or would deem a minimum. The way the movie is edited doesn't help, a lot of the footage lacks cinematic grandeur, the music is predictable and somewhat repetitive. This movie can't even polish the shoes of intense, gripping productions like Band of Brothers. Literally the most boring scenes of that miniseries are still more interesting than the most interesting scenes of Dunkirk. And that's a sad conclusion to sum this all up with.I feel like I'm wasting my time even writing this - the movie is just not worth really thinking about. I'm going to watch a few documentaries about Dunkirk to get the bad aftertaste of Nolan's failed recount out of my mouth."
263," A terrible movie
","it's a very annoying war movie, the worst I have seen since like forever.. nothing is realistic, acting is terrible.. nothing makes sense I don't know what else I can write to describe how bad is this movie.I wish I could help more"
264," Screams low budget but it's not!!
","I was very much looking forward to this film but it disappoints in just about every way. The acting is horrible, characters are uninteresting, and some of the battle scenes are so hoaky I think I could film them myself with some buddies. The acting lets you know right away that it is ""acting,"" unlike in a quality film that sucks you in, mesmerizes you, and you feel like it's real. Not at all the case here. Very amateur and a waste of time. I want my 1:30 back!!!"
265," An assault on my ears
","I went to see Dunkirk at the very end of it's movie theater run. Therefore I've heard how great it is, and was expecting to be impressed. Maybe I was expecting too much but I was underwhelmed. Now a day later I have found out that 'the Mole' is a dock for loading ships. Where the screen showed 'The mole, one week', 'The Sea, one Day', and 'The air, One Hour' it meant that there was going to be three different story lines occurring over one week, one day, and one hour, simultaneously. I didn't realize, while watching the film, that that was how the film was setup. (I was trying to figure out what a Mole was. It would have really helped if they said ""The Dock - during one week"", etc. Plus the movie continuously cuts back and forth between these story lines. So you move forward in time, then back, then forward. Throw that all together and you can see why the movie is very confusing to some.I'm very familiar with the story of Dunkirk so the jumping around from time line to time line didn't throw me off that much. Except for when it was obviously night time in one story, and daytime in another. If I only had known that there were three movies going on at once. It would have made a lot more sense.My biggest problem with the movie was the sound track. Perhaps this only occurred in my theater (I doubt that), but it was oppressively loud. Not just the bang bang of guns firing, that's expected in movies these days, but here there is constant background droning. Not airplane noise - just really loud single note background noise. I took a tissue and stuffed it into my ears within 10 minutes of the start of the film, and I never felt that I could take the plugs out.The next biggest problem is the lack of a coherent story. I went with a friend who didn't know the Dunkirk story, and she had no idea what was going on. Over 300,000 soldiers were evacuated! You never would have known that through this movie. A third of the soldiers evacuated were French! You will have the opposite idea after the movie. Hundreds of small boats helped in the evacuation! The film shows about 12. The real WWII soldiers were well disciplined, and while there is always chaos in war, there was a chain of command in control! In this film there seems to be 3 people of high rank and everyone else is a private and on their own.There are some good points to the movie. Not enough to justify the current price of admission, but it wasn't a total waste."
266," It looks beautiful and at times immerses you in the action, but that's about it
","Personally, I was disappointed by it. And I actually like Inception and Interstellar.It looks very good, and the scenes where stuff was happening did immerse you in the experience. I admire the lack of dialogue and the use of actors who looked authentic, warts and all.But the characters were almost like cardboard cutouts and I did not feel any sort of attachment to any of them nor did I reach any deeper understanding of them. There was not nearly enough historical context provided.I hated the soundtrack. I found it was grating and at times the movie was just too loud. Some will say it was supposed to be grating, but I still found it pretentious. It's like the usual ""bwaaaaaas"" we hear for dramatic effect in all the blockbuster films and their previews. It worked for me at the beginning of Inception, but they didn't cram that kind of thing into every scene like they do here, and there was an actual soundtrack that wasn't just bombastic noise IMO. A guy can't even take a dump without the soundtrack trying to make it seem epic.I also felt that many parts just dragged on, and that there were things that didn't quite make sense to me, such as:I didn't understand why all the soldiers stood on the pier like sitting ducks. In WWI, people figured out that you shouldn't build trenches in a straight line because a plane can just swoop down and machine gun everyone in it. Yet here are the soldiers standing exactly in that formation. I was surprised that the planes continued dropping bombs rather than just gunning everyone down. The soldiers also just kept cowering instead of firing at the planes. Enough people firing a volley seems like it wouldn't be in vain.The scene in the boat with the bullet holes appearing and everyone arguing about how someone should leave, even though the weight of the water coming in was several times that of a single man, and then them trying to plug the holes with their hands when I could've sworn I saw things lying around in there that they could have used. Even if they did manage to plug the holes with their hands, they couldn't possibly keep them plugged the whole way, and people will still have to go up to sail the boat. Let alone the fact that it made no sense for Germans, or whoever else, to waste time distracting themselves with target practice on a vessel and giving away their position when in a real combat situation.I found the flight scenes to be redundant and boring. There were times when it did feel realistic and was kind of cool, but then they would just show what almost felt like the same scenes repeatedly. Some say they actually reused footage.When that pilot goes down and can't get out of the cockpit, I felt it was such a drawn out cliché. And I didn't understand why the other pilot stays behind and lands further east on the beach instead of landing and evacuating with the others. I thought maybe it was so that he could be there in case there were other planes to shoot down, but then he would have stayed in the area, not left it.The scenes on the civilian yacht felt unnecessary and unengaging. The flashback to Cillian Murphy's past didn't add anything to the story and wasn't clearly transitioned into, making it confusing. And I didn't understand why all of these people came on the boats when each of them is taking the space of a soldier who could be evacuated.Similarly confusing and pretentious was how there were supposedly three parts to this with an amount of time accompanying each, which I didn't understand, e.g. ""the mole (one week)"" and ""air (one hour)."" I hate when this is done unnecessarily. Tarantino loves overusing that.All the British pride schlock was cringe-worthy, from the kid who is a ""hero"" because he hit his head and died, taking up the space of multiple soldiers as he was lying down, to many of Kenneth Branagh's one-dimensional scenes, to the writing at the end just before the credits.To me, it felt more like a pet project that Nolan enjoyed geeking out over while making, but that isn't as pleasant for the actual viewers, except Nolan fanboys who will eat up anything he does and call it a masterpiece, hence the artificially high rating on IMDb and the glowing reviews everywhere.There are also doubts as to its historical accuracy, though I personally am not knowledgeable in the topic.An article in Slate titled ""What's Fact and What's Fiction in Dunkirk"" claims that it is largely accurate.But then I've heard others say it isn't historically accurate, e.g. claiming that:-The number of soldiers and boats shown was nowhere near the true scale of what happened-There were anti-aircraft guns present-There were more than three spitfires available that day-There was no high-ranking officer such as Branagh's character on the ground-The beach looked too clean, when in reality there were debris everywhere-The buildings in the background are all undamaged when in reality they had taken heavy damage-It contains many anachronisms: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5013056/goofs"
267," This time Nolan disappoint. Badly.
","First 10 minutes are great. Just what you expected. You almost crouch and hide to avoid the bullets, your heart races and that sound terrifies you. You are at Dunkirk: lost, hungry, desperate. And stukas are above you.Than just repeat that over and over again, in the boat, on the sea, in the plane....and every time is less and less involving.Nolan is still Nolan: great shots, superb sound mixing, and he plays with the mighty water like no other (very much like in interstellar ""waves"" planet) but there is no real involvement.And it lacks sense of scale and dimensions, credibility (expecially for the spitfire gliding sequence), and the worst: time. And we are talking about the master of time, here!Sorry Christopher, this time is a no go! :-("
268," one of the most perplexing films I've ever seen
","Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk was heralded everywhere as his greatest achievement yet, so you can imagine as a big fan of his i was excited to see it.Well, that excitement turned to disappointment very fastThe first 30 minutes are very impressive, the camera-work, the direction, the pacing are fantastic, the film has the best ship sinking scene filmed since titanic, the air battles are also exceptionally well filmed, and are way more subtle and realistic than most films.The problems however stem from two different, but very important things.first of all, the film has no characters, none of them are developed at all, we don't have a protagonist to root for really, all the actors are just used as props for the big battle scenes without any personality or investment.i feel like Nolan was so happy with how well he story-boarded his big scenes that he only realized he forgot to write actual characters in the movie when the cameras were already rolling, which is really confusing to me, because Nolan used to be one of those directors who prioritized characters over the plot in most of his movies, sometimes even to their detriment (like the dark knight rises).but this was just a big spectacle with zero personal investment, granted the sequences themselves were exceptionally well executed and filmed so kudos to Nolan for that, he really took it to the next level, but if we're not invested then no matter how well it's done we wont care, so the movie unfortunately became boring very quickly, which wasn't helped by the other big problem.The movie becomes very repetitive. We see an amazing ship sinking sequence, with mouths wide open, but then the next big sequence is another ship sinking, and then another, and then another, the same with the plane fight sequences, they just did the same thing over and over, and since we weren't invested to begin with, it became even more boring.So the movie was ultimately an exercise in futility, Christopher Nolan wasted one of his best directorial achievements on a movie with his worst writing one. Resulting in an impersonal, albeit impressive film, that lacks heart and character."
269," Dunkirk (2017)
","Hey everyone, I was in the movie, and I was really bored as hell. I do not know why, like the movie isn't really good... I think you should think before watching this movie. I am not telling you not to watch it but I am warning you that you have to see the trailer before watching it. It might not be your type of thing. So good luck, and tell me if you loved the movie or not. Thank You."
270," Tedious And Lacking
","While the true story and heroic efforts of the Dunkirk Evacuation deserve a 10, this movie does not. The worst of it was the droning, somber monotony of the musical soundtrack, particularly in the first portion of the movie, which has to be the most tediously overwrought score in history; followed by another heavy handed long section of a repetitively monotonous 4 or 5 note ascending minor scale, all of which was a serious and unfortunate detraction from the action on screen. One of the historically unique facts of this evacuation was the civilian fleet of nearly 400 small craft (Wikipedia) which heroically volunteered for this amazing feat, which I think was under-depicted. By the movie's end, it confirmed the senseless stupidity of geo-political wars and conflicts caused by governmental leaders, and the resulting senseless personal loss at the battle front. But faced with this senselessness, it also celebrated individual acts of bravery and sacrifice.Conspicuously and sadly absent was a written narrative at the end which summarized and brought into focus the huge scope of this historic evacuation, along with actual photographs."
271," Fails to deliver overall
","I have been so looking forward to this movie. Having studied the evacuation of Dunkirk, many years ago and also having been to visit the beaches and also the wartime tunnels at Dover where much of the planning was conceived, my expectations was that this would be a movie to rival all WW2 movies before it.However, all the way through the movies I felt like it was skimming the surface of what happened and never really got going at any point. I left deeply disappointed.The movie itself is telling the story of the evacuation from several different viewpoints which are timed in with each other. This I felt was a really good concept, to get the views of civilians trying to help, soldiers, fliers and officers alike. Where it falls down in my opinion is that the film is almost totally devoid of script. The characters involved only have a few lines throughout the entire movie. It is hard to find any type of connection to them as there is no story about them.But perhaps the biggest let down of them all is that there is literally zero mention of the epic planning, call to arms and execution of the Dunkirk evacuation. There is hardly any mention of Bertram Ramsey, the man responsible for the entire evacuation. This was the largest evacuation of troops in British military history. There were hundreds of private trawlers used, hundreds of aircraft, dozens of royal navy ships. This film failed to capture any of this and instead focused on a few individuals, but failed to give them a script.Honestly I feel that if you didn't know the story of Dunkirk, before you went and saw this, you would leave still not really knowing, and this for me is the greatest let down by Nolan. This movie FAILS to actually tell the story of Dunkirk.The music score by Hans Zimmer is excellent, the effects in the movie are excellent. It fails in almost every other department."
272," ""Some ships rescue a bunch of soldiers"" By Christopher Nolan
","This was one of the most disappointing movies I've ever seen. I LOVE historical and war movies, but this is not the case, Though it wasn't awful, i'd probably never watch it again. Pros: great story. Good acting. No cheese scenes. Period. Cons: Edition is terrible, very difficult to get along with (my sister got completely lostwith the non lineal timing). Characters are really underdeveloped. I didn't cared at all if they lived or not, because there was no plausible difference with non- main character soldiers. Music is quite annoying (sorry Hans) Staging SUCKS. There were 400.000 souls and 1000 civil boats in Dunkirk. But Nolan decided that 2000 soldiers and 20 boats were enough. WHERE THE HECK ARE THE OTHER 398000 SOLDIERS AND 980 BOATS MY DEAR CHRISTOPHER?!??!?!? A HUGE BUDGET JUST TO PAY FACELESS TOM HARDY? WELCOME TO CGI ERA!!!! YOU JUST HAVE TO DO COPY PASTE A COUPLE OF TIMES WITH YOUR ARMY! MY DEAR GOD IT REALLY GRINDS MY GEARS. Pause Breathe Happy place Where were we? Yes! Conclusions. The movie is just... good. Maybe the problem is that I was expecting a movie way more overwhelming. The movie is, all in all, inconsistent. Characters are shallow and you never get to understand the real dimension of the events. You just now how many people they saved because the paper says so. But if it was for Nolan's point of view, it's just a bunch of boats that saved a couple hundred soldiers. Really difficut to understand if you never read about Dunkirk before. As I have already said, the most disappointing movie I've ever seen."
273," Another disappointment
","What can I say about this film that doesn't slate it too much, everything. What a load of boring drivel, all the adverts saying it's a masterpiece, best acting ever, pffft. We are basically shown in this film that our ships were made of paper, one torpedo and they were sunk in 2 minutes, the fighter pilot has no aim whatsoever, he rarely speaks and then instead of landing his plane on a safe part of the beach or in the sea he decides to land miles away from anywhere but right in front of the Germans, which by the way is pretty much the only time you see one. In another part some soldiers are trying desperately to sail a boat full of bullet holes by sticking their fingers in them, like that's going to help. Now don't get me wrong, I totally understand how awful it must have been for the soldiers standing their waiting and the pain and suffering they had to endure, but this film did not really portray that at all, what a shame that all the radio and TVs hype yet another movie just to make money, there were so many other random scenes in this film almost as if someone picked up lots of bits from the cutting room and stuck them all together. Sorry but this film is a no no."
274," Boring and very shallow acting
","I was so eager to watch Dunkirk as i'm a WW2 fanatic! 20 min in to the movie and I knew it was going to be a boring ride. War movies should make the audience feel and sense the suffering of the soldiers, it should go under your skin, but this one was completely no feeling show.Silly dog fights, very artificial smoke, actually one of the BF109 got hit on the right wing and smoke blasted from the left one!What a waste!!I only gave it 2 stars for the boat scene where the Germans were practicing shooting their weapons.Other than that, a big ZERO."
275," The story is the story ?
","Would have been good if there were any real story except maybe one about the RAF pilot what little there was. Director Nolan is trying to tell a story through a soldier's eyes. He tracks one young private with no name and gave him almost no dialog throughout the retreat. The soldier with no name wore the same shell-shock expression in the entire movie. Nothing he did was significant - so why are we following him? The pilot whom i was told was a great actor in UK but he had on a pilot's face mask the entire time, only at the end when he fueled out and stepped off his plane did he show his face. The pilot showed great skill in aerial combat. When his 2 other fly mates were shot down, he seemed to have stemmed the entire Nazi air force all by himself. At the end, the story suggests he chose to stay in the fight using up all his fuel than leaving the British ships undefended. Amazingling the ships nearly did nothing to defend themselves! I don't see any AA action. Nolan must be a one-sided believer in air power. I had to stretch my imagination to see what the pilot was up to. The beach at times look deserted. There were supposed to be 400,000 men stranded there. At least they could have CGI some of them in. Weird! The screen writer seems to want to say it's every man for himself out there. There were no order to it. Ken Branaugh was paid to look regal and just say his lines but seems detached to the men or even the war. After an hour of running around, occasional strafing from a couple of Luftwaffe planes and boats sinking it gets monotonous. Without any story building, at least the screen writer could have throw in some perspective from the German side. The only ""german"" seen were shadows of Nazi helmets descended on the pilot after he bailed out and torched his plane. About the boat sinking, director Nolan chose to show 4 maybe 5 boats sinking if you count the hospital ship in the beginning. The entire British destroyer loss in the operation was six. Nolan was obliged to show almost all of them sinking ?I thought the 1958 version of Dunkirk was boring, but this one bores just same, except some spectacular air crashes. Not enough to save anything. Not even close to ""Private Ryan""."
276," emotionless, dull, tedious and frankly poor on every level
","Not being a Christopher Nolan slappie, I was able to judge this effort all on its own merit. Watching what hits the screen plays out like a tedious and poorly constructed cable documentary. Honestly, there is literally not one ounce of character development or establishment at all. It's just a dry depiction of three round robin events that cascades from one harrowing circumstance to the next. one revolving around a fighter pilot, another around a foot soldier and his French imposter hanger-on trying to survive and the other about an elder statesmen boat owner and his efforts to aid the cause. The only one that is even remotely interesting involves the boat owner, his son and poor lil' George. In fact, the only character name given as to remember it was poor sad lil' George. I didn't make it to the final credits but I wonder if the rest of the cast of characters was simply titled ""nameless soldier""? Having no depth means limited emotional impact and that does a disservice to the real life heroes this movie tries to honor. What alleviates the shear dullness of what is depicted often comes in the form of a racing soundtrack. It's as if the frantic music is your cue on how to react because it's hard to tell by just watching the visuals. The movie itself is all one grim repetitive note. After a while, the grinding soundtrack does start to annoy and pushes towards headache inducing territory. Is that some kind of sloppy film making trick? Trick the audience in to feeling uneasy using other senses rather than simply writing an impactful story? It IS dull and it can hardly be called an actual movie given how it's structured but it's not offensively bad and does its job showing the grim events of Dunkirk."
277," Why the hype?
","I am sorry, but I did not like this film.Went to see it with 2 friends, and during the opening 15min both one friend and I both looked at each other, and thought that the location scouts had done a terrible job. From what we could assess, none of the 40's Dunkirk streets had been rebuilt, you see buildings that look strikingly like they were from the 80's or 70's from the last century. For this type of budget? Furthermore, we all know the story, so where were the boats jammed with solders? During several scenes, we see soldiers almost scattered around on a ship. The same with soldiers on the beach. Did they have trouble hiring extras? Was there some resistance to CGI scenery's/soldiers in? If yes, then I am sorry, but it did part of making this film a failure in my eyes. The music and the ticking clock, that you almost hear constantly in this film had it's own little role in annoying me (just annoying, not adding suspense or any form of dimension. We do know that time was a factor in Dunkirk, there's no need to give you 2h of ticking clock for that).Thumbs up for the air scenes and a good job from Tom Hardy. OK for drama, decent job from the young actors. A film transporting the right level of patriotism for this monumental achievement by the British/French people, not forgetting about the individual tragedies and lives torn apart.But, I am sorry, I think this was a terrible job for creating the canvas of the movie, the set & atmosphere.I don't like to trash films, but in this case, the people who were there deserve better."
278," Woefully disappointing
","Looking at most of the other reviews I must have watched a different movie. I expected a lot from this movie from the build up and hype, especially given the story line. If you are expecting something along the lines of SPR then forget it. For a start this movie should have been a U certificate as there is absolutely nothing in it that would justify a 12a or even a 12 certificate. All that would constitute a rating above a U (Graphic scenes of violence, Gore element, Nudity and profane language) there was none. The whole film was empty of any feeling of fear or danger of what it was like being involved in the evacuation of Dunkirk. At no point do you get even a bit emotional during the movie and at the end you are left thinking Oh Well.. shall we go and get a pizza. I sat alongside a couple of people in their 80's who's only tears were the price of the tickets. They simply said 'It was nothing like that...much worse). This really was a movie about one man and his boat setting out in his frightfully perfect suit and tie in an effort to rescue the whole of 300,000 stranded servicemen. One dogfight involving 6 planes shown from different perspectives (which was not only boring but confusing) throughout the movie, two ships sinking..again shown multiple times from different perspectives and a few queues of soldiers in perfectly clean uniforms (bearing in mind they are escaping after months of combat) as if they were waiting for the canteen to open. When a 'straffe' occurred they all ducked as if ducking from the rain. The worse thing was you were left with the impression that only half a dozen local fishing boats went over because thats all you see arriving at the beach. Tom Hardy in the roll of a spitfire pilot was a total waste of an A list actor and as for the acting debut of Harry Stiles...well give me a break, stick to singing I would say. Mark Rylance is superb as ever and Kenneth Brannagh..well you know Kenneth.. Rah Rah Yah Yah and all that, a proper gentleman he was organizing the hospital ship. Strangely no German soldiers...in a WWII war film, give me a break please. The biggest laugh, all said and done and the half a dozen boats had rescued all 300,000 (which you didn't see) they were welcomed home by the dutiful English lady with a Cup of Tea more less saying 'There There Boys better luck next time. This movie given Nolan's previous work had so much potential and totally missed the opportunity. I give it 2 for the sound effects, which were also awful but better than the movie."
279," Dunkirk is Okay but Underwhelming
","Dunkirk is the latest film by Christopher Nolan. As usual people are praising his film as a masterpiece. I'm a fan of Nolan so I wanted to love this film like everyone else. However, I have to be honest; this is one of his weaker films, in my opinion. I'm not the biggest fan of war movies, so that doesn't help either. I would put this over The Prestige and The Dark Knight Rises, but every other film he's made I think is better. I would even put Interstellar over this. I'm not the biggest fan of war films, so that doesn't help either. Though, this is certainly not the best war movie I've seen either. The film isn't bad, but it's painfully average.The plot is very simple. The Germans have pushed the British and the French back to the beaches of Dunkirk. Military vessels and plains are in short supply so civilian boats are mobilized to rescue the stranded troops on the beach. The rest of the film is the soldiers surviving on the beach as the civilian vessels make their way there.The film does some things well. From a technical aspect Dunkirk is amazing. The film looks great, and the effects are amazing, as one would expect from a Nolan film. It has the typical gray, bleak look to it, like in most Nolan movies, but it fit the tone of the film and gave it a good atmosphere. The music also fit very well.The action scenes are alright for what they are. This is not action-heavy war movie, but a survival war picture. Do not expect wall-to-wall action in that sense. I also like how the Germans are never seen throughout the flick, but there presence is still heavily felt. The few fight scenes we do get are okay at best. Some of the action gets confusion, and becomes difficult to tell who is fighting who.The issue with this movie is that it gets dull. This is one of Nolan's shorter films, at two hours, yet you can still feel the length at times. Some scenes feel unnecessary or are dragged out for too long.The characters are also dull. That's the film's main problem is that all of the characters are boring. The acting is fine, but the characters they are not that interesting; none of them. Cillian Murphy, a great actor, is wasted in this role. It's not that I hated any of the characters, but I wasn't invested in any of them either.That's a problem, because characters are essential getting invested in a story. If you have good characters the viewers are on that journey with them and feel what they feel. Since I wasn't invested in the characters the film did not hit nearly as hard with me as it should have. The message of Dunkirk is the same as any war film. It wants to convey to the audience how terrible war is. However, there are so many war movies that do this better because they have a better cast that resonates with you.Overall, Dunkirk is a mixed bag. It's an okay movie that's worth one watch. However, there are better war films, and certainly better Christopher Nolan movies, out there."
280," More like a documentary than a dramatic film
","Not too much I liked about this film. Emotionless story for the most part, with mostly repetitive bombing and killing and a soundtrack that was deafening and unrelenting. The film's color was also washed out which bled any potential emotion from it. Character development was non-existent. Mostly scenes of scared to death young men trying to survive.Didn't like at all the 3 stories in one gimmicky approach to this important historical event. Scenes constantly jumped from one of the 3 stories to the another with no relationship to the last scene shown, only to the last scene of the same story shown earlier. Also, too much repetition and different angles of air attacks, with soldiers constantly in the water from bombings and too little of anything else that made Dunkirk the historical war icon that it is known to be. For example, in one scene it was disheartening and historically inaccurate to show one destroyer that didn't even fire a shot at a bomber that sunk it even as the plane was clearly visible from miles off. And, the many plane dog fights were too repetitive and did not look realistic for the most part. There were also too many scenes that looked ""off"" in historical accuracy to me, one example being the one of soldiers in an abandoned boat on the beach, being shot at by an unseen shooter, but none of the soldiers were killed or even hit by the many bullets that pierced the boat's sides. Not one.The entire story and editing of the film annoyed me to the point that I ended up not caring much what happened at the end. That is never a good thing in a war movie. The different time lines of the 3 stories were more than disorienting at times as the film cut from story to story and back again, with all time in each......suspended. If this famous filmmaker wanted to make a documentary, he should have made one. What was missing was a dramatic movie. To me, bad form to mix the two but keep an emotion-starved, washed-out color, documentary style story throughout. This story could have been told and shown a lot better."
281," When ""computer generated imagery"" can teach you a lesson in history
","For sure, many and many viewers went to the cinema with great expectations for the movie Dunkirk. Most of them thinking it would be like the ""New Saving Private Ryan"". Unfortunately it is not so, and not in the sense that it is not an action packed block-buster. First of all, Dunkirk is not a bad movie, but it is not the movie it was expected to be and was so anticipated. The decision taken by the film director Christopher Nolan, not to use computer graphic, or to use it as less as possible, was in this case, in my opinion, the wrong choice. I speak as a history buff, so obviously, I had great expectation in seeing huge scenes and pictures, that only movies can give from past events, like bringing a history book or memories of veterans alive. Dunkirk isn't that, and that is, in my opinion its greatest flaw. It is important, for such a movie, to let you learn something, to get an impression, to perceive a past event, something maybe you have read about, but you never could really imagine. This is were Saving Private Ryan, speaking about WW2, (pardon me this comparison, it is the first that comes to mind, I could cite countless others Stalingrad, U-96 or for example Platoon for Vietnam War), really shines and where Dunkirk completely fails. Transmitting you an impression, a feeling for such true immense and tragic events. In Dunkirk, you have to imagine what is happening around the focus of the camera, you have to know the context, you don't get it served, transmitted. Before you go for this movie, to really appreciate it, you have to document yourself, or most of what Dunkirk was, a true gigantic episode in history, will simply don't emerge or even reach you. In my opinion a war movie, or maybe a movie with a historical background has to literally take you to its time, transport you in its century and let you leave the movie hall with a feeling of astonishment, curiosity and desire to learn more about what you just saw, maybe even kindle a passion in in the specific subject. With Dunkirk this is not the case, it is a good drama, but for sure it is not a history lesson and even less a historical movie. At the most, it will leave you some impressions, that you get from the different points of view from the protagonists, but all them without a real and remaining contextualization. Nothing that will make you think about it on your way back home, nothing that will stick in our memories and maybe would have helped to fill a gap in the common knowledge, of so many of us."
282," Impressive on Technicalities, Complete Failure on Scale
","Dunkirk is a visual treat for art-buffs and students of cinematic discipline. But for everyone else, especially those who love history, the movie is a massive failure due to it's sheer incompetence in capturing the scale and import of the biggest military evacuation in modern history- 3,38,000 allied soldiers saved by over 1000 boats and ships in just a week. Dunkirk was not just any other battle incident in WWII. It's the story of how a large number of civilian vessels and navy ships safely transport around an enormous number of soldiers back to home. Its about achieving impossibility, doing a miracle, defying all odds only because so huge number of people were to be saved by so many untrained rescuers. Dunkirk is all and only about scale. Take this scale out and it becomes meaningless. Ask yourself - would anyone had given entire incident a second glance if there were 1000 soldiers to be saved and 20 odd boats came from Britain to do the job? No one, including Christopher Nolan himself. Yet he takes this subject and almost in a blasphemous treatment of its importance, does away with the very scale that made Dunkirk 'Dunkirk'. What you see is an empty beach, a handful of soldier, a few odd boats in water, and two spitfires in sky, trying to play out a theatrical enactment of entire event. And that's what this movie is- just theatrics and technicalities- creating temporal disturbances in story lines to impress the gullible, patching oddball narratives to cover- up for plot weakness, raining down musical scores to hide its lack of substance. I hope Mr Nolan never makes a movie on memory of Hiroshima attack - because then instead of a giant mushroom cloud that killed over 40,000 souls and decimated a city we will see a mild explosion and a couple of smoked huts."
283," Not a Nolan's genre.
","Since, it is a war concept movie most of the people may like this movie.But Nolan have not tried to satisfy his fans.Cinematography,Music,Acting-these are aspects of the movie that i appreciate.Bombing & Blasting in IMAX is unbearable & especially that ticking sound never ends until Nolan name appears in the credits.We did not expect this from Nolan.Overall it is one time watchable in normal theaters not in IMAX. It is a disaster for some of his fans i would say.Real concepts does not suit for Nolan's direction.At first when people come out from the theatre they will be in excited mode since it is Nolan's direction.I also went through the same feeling but if you think & review the whole movie once from the beginning then the genuine review comes."
284," Masterclasss in turning epic story in to pathetic movie
","I really cannot think of anything positive to say about this movie except for having Spitfires in it. But even as much as I love Spitfires they couldn't save this movie. Clichéd, characterless, frustrating, unoriginal, technically wrong in so many ways etc etc. Sometimes just telling a great story is enough without all the arty cinematography done to death. A macro story turned into a micro characterless tale. Watch the original 1958 version instead, better in every way except there are no Spitfires in it."
285," Disappointment
","I am sorry to say I was disappointed in this movie. After all the hype and trailers for this movie I found it boring. I was expecting a war epic with much more action and more of a story line concerning the rescue of the all the men trapped on the beaches of Dunkirk. The attempt of the producers to have the audience bond with the characters, I feel failed. The only persons that I did felt connected to were the captain of the small pleasure craft and his son. These two coming from England to the beach of Dunkirk I enjoyed. There should have been more emphasis on the real story here, that being the hundreds of ships, small and large, that were the real heroes of this historic event."
286," Quite disliked it
","I was bored so much of the film - the plethora of characters about whom one knows nothing - and thus cares little; the remarkably confusing story line (three story lines - which cover one week, one day and one hour - in which we are supposed to see one line's incident reflected in the other story line at an earlier or later time - but this means we wonder which of the 17 times we see a ship blown up is significant to which point in another story line at a different point in the movie? Which of the planes we see knocked down is one we saw at another point - or shall see at another point from a different perspective? We don't care); the indifferent film score - nothing too grand, no real crescendo, nothing that could be described as patriotic; long long stretches in which nothing happens; the deliberate undercutting of the idea of the people as having an idealism great than self-interest - and many of the principal characters deliberately sabotaging the overall effort - or deceiving others - or acting in a xenophobic way - or committing suicide out of fear ... anything to undermine a ""spirit of Dunkirk"" emotional feeling; All this is quite deliberate by the director - and to have just spent $50 ($23.50 for the IMAX seat, another $27 for a hot dog, soda and popcorn) - simply makes one far more reluctant to attend a movie - no matter the many (wrong-headed) plaudits."
287," terrible movie like evacuation
","How Dunkirk Evacuation is a disgrace for British Army ""Dunkirk"" as a movie is a disgrace for Nolan like that. Merely as a war movie, it is a mediocre with its tension and action. Also when we think about as a Nolan's movie it is a huge dis appointment. Disconnected, insufficient and stunk. I hope, Nolan don't make this movie because of Queen's request in exchange for James Bond series."
288," No Characters, No Plot, Disjointed.
","Viewed 08/04/17Just left the theater wondering what I just saw.There was NO character development. I did not of cared about them. When a character did speak, they were mumbling or the effects drowned out what they were saying.Time was artsy-fartsy jumping from night to day.Ships that should have been loaded with humans barely had anyone standing on the rail.Large explosions in the water with no smoke.One character says there are 400,000 men trapped. Then a shot of the beach shows maybe 1,000. Maybe.TERRIBLE ending.Brannagh should have laughed this one off.The director/writer is obviously quite full of himself.Dunkirk will show up on ""Best Of"" lists. What a shame."
289," So disappointed - this movie had no soul
",I was so looking forward to this movie and knowing the history of Dunkirk I thought I was in for a really moving movie that would make us proud of the people that rallied together to get the solders home.But my wife and I were very disappointed with Dunkirk. The sound throughout the movie was awful with repeating sounds repeating over and over for ages driving you mad. But if this was its only flaw it would not have been so bad but the movie was very disjointed flicking from one thing to another and it took me a while to work out that we sometimes were watching the same scene but from different perspectives.The characters in the movie meant nothing to me and I did not care about them at all which is a tragedy for such a moving story as Dunkirk it was as if the movie had no soul.I have heard of people being moved to tears watching this and the only tears we would shed was for the £20 admission fee.Go watch a great war movie like Hacksaw Ridge which is in a whole different league to this
290," Take me out of this beach as soon as possible...
","I was waiting for this film with great anticipation since it was announced many months ago.WWII films are one of my favorites genres, and with that, I am talking about classics like The Guns Of Navarone, The Eagle Has Landed, Saving Private Ryan, etc.Keeping that in mind, I must say that I left the theatre utterly disappointed, not only with the shallow narrative of a major WWII event but, with the way Chris Nolan decided to tell his story.** SPOILERS AHEAD **The three point of view storytelling is somewhat confusing, first because it is not so obvious what Nolan is trying to do, it takes a while to notice the dynamics, and, the always present continuity errors (gross sometimes) do not help either. I am not attached to traditional storytelling, and most of the films I like had some kind of alternate scripts, but for my liking, it went a bit too far with Dunkirk.Another major flaw is the shallowness of the story, all the characters are almost like supporting characters, with no lead or at least one or two characters you feel empathy for. Maybe Noland made the ""lead character"" the event itself, but it is not depicted with depth or detail (I will not mention historical accuracy) it deserves either.The icing on the cake was, in both positive and negative senses (caveat: I am an aviation enthusiast and work as an airline pilot), the air combat scenes. Impressive work and kudos for Nolan for not using only CGI, always a pleasure to see, and hear, some Spitfire/RR Merlin in action. The air combat sequences were, indeed, the highlight for me.But also a major disappointment, as ** MAJOR SPOILER AHEAD ** the final sequences practically disregarded all the laws of aerodynamics and energy management known to men (back then and today). Planes can not fly forever, do air combat maneuvering and then fly sustained and prolonged level flight without an engine running. Period.4/10"
291," Could have been better
","As other reviews here describe in great depth, Nolan has successfully implemented the best of visuals and sound effects. However, the hype created by trailers falls pretty short of describing a genuinely intense and desperate evacuation that took place during the whole battle.At first, the trailers looked as if the Commonwealth Army fought a desperate retreat to 'home'; however, what we see are repetitive scenes that of a handful of Stuka divers getting destroyed by a group of just three RAF fighters, only one of which keeps on the skies while the other two survive on the same escape boat.Its not the setting or the diversion of the director's traditional way of telling one of history's most important events as an all out war (like what one could remember from The Enemy at the Gates or Saving Private Ryan), but the lack of depth in showing the true nature of that hasty evacuation that took place when news had spread that German forces from all sides would be surrounding the allied landing within hours. What we see instead is anonymous soldiers simply changing boats from ships and vice versa, and finally reach 'home sweet home' without really showing much of the real blood that was spilled in order to protect those who were to be evacuated. So, although the movie launches off nicely, it goes monotone within 45 minutes.I wish Nolan had shown the French lines that there were holding their ground from the Germans and relate all that with the evacuation that was taking place. Its just too plain."
292," Disappointing and incoherent
","I had big expectations for this one, I kept watching because I thought it was maybe getting better near the end. It didn't. Characters are shallow and the whole movie just misses the engagement you need to enjoy such an important story. I personally think there was a lot of potential in this story..."
293," my time is too precious to waste on a crap film like this
","I'll be honest. I watched less than an hour of this before bailing out. Whatever good may have happened after I turned off the TV, it could not possibly outweigh the absolute crap I'd seen up until that point. It's an insult to the men who risked and lost their lives to misrepresent such a pivotal event in the 20th century. Really, all the dramatic freight you need for a fantastic movie is there in Dunkirk. All you have to do is tell the story and you'd have a great film. Instead, there is this mish-mash of whatever random blah blah yuk stupidity. Yes, that is exactly as much sense as it makes, any of it. I was not just disappointed, I was insulted. A generation of young people will grow up with a very badly mistaken impression about Dunkirk, and that is the worst possible outcome of a bad movie about a historical event. Shame on all the people responsible for this completely crap movie."
294," A deeply boring, forgetful film.
","I was excited to see Dunkirk and I had gone with some friends. However, I was bored throughout, it was hard to follow, and just too long. The only redeeming quality that this movie had was the portrayal of the characters from the actors including newcomer to acting Harry Styles. I fell asleep several times."
295," Send in the Writers!
","Obviously a lot was left out of this story: dialogue, plot, women, and dead fish. I could attempt to justify my opinion but by now you've seen the film. The story could have been valiantly told a million different ways with millions of different story lines; this is not a valiant effort. I kept wondering when a magic voice would make sense of the action and what the Hell it had to do with anything. Sorry, no 'out of the blue' explanation for most of the disjointed visual sequences. Usually I would welcome a Director's cut but in this movie's case ..... Great special effects though. Give the CGI group a standing ovation."
296," Felt like it told 2/3rds of the the story.
","I just got back from seeing Dunkirk. What I did like about the movie was the resourcefulness of the Brit & French soldiers who met on the beach. The cinematography was awesome, watching the dogfights from boat level. Mark Rylance (Bridge of Spies) & son's journey was inspiring. As was dog-fighting on fumes by Hardy's character. I went to the show for the story and because Cillian Murphy & Tom Hardy were in it. I was disappointed that there was no backstory. This would have been a better movie at 2 1/2 hrs. Had expected Churchill & war room discussion/argument with the Naval Command. Very little in WW11 happened without the Commonwealth and as I understand it British India Forces were at Dunkirk and white outed out of the story. As was Cmr. Cloustons' massive contribution to the evacuation. I was disappointed that the movie was too short and didn't have the politics in it and the Commonwealth wasn't represented at all. I'll read books on Dunkirk but I wouldn't see the movie again."
297," Lost Opportunity
","I totally love WW2 movies, so when the trailers for Dunkirk came out it was a definite one to see. Dunkirk was a true testament to the British people who sailed out in small boats to bring home the BEF. This was a true story of heroic private citizens saving the day, so did the movie show the true scale of this remarkable feat. In my opinion it did not, you never felt the monumental scale of the evacuation or the danger that the BEF were subjected to on the beach. Instead the focus was on a few characters and what they went through, now this may have worked better if it wasn't for the fact that their stories and how the all interact doesn't happen at the same time. One minute you are at night with one character and then during the day with another, why the story wasn't filmed as each character went through their own individual stories is a missed opportunity. Dunkirk is at best a good movie but no classic war movie, so it will not end up there with the greats."
298," Epically overrated
","I was disappointed by this film. It is a mish-mash of poorly acted and poorly executed snippets. It is unconvincing and unengaging throughout. Quite the achievement given the subject matter and richness of possibilities in 300,000 personal stories and witnesses. Judged by what was on screen it could have been a TV movie with limited budget for a juvenile audience. Dunkirk deserved better."
299," Please
","Here we have a film that does not bother to put a couple of sentences about what Dunkirk was all about. Don't know it already? Don't worry, the film is so chaotic and noisy and violent that it is about chaos, noise and violence and it doesn't matter what the underlying story is. There is virtually no dialog, what there is is nearly incomprehensible. The music - praised to the skies by other reviewers - is not original at all, it is very much like the Jaws score. Intense, 'sposed to make you realize the danger afoot. Loud, relentless. The story of the soldiers being evacuated from Dunkirk beach, and helped by a flotilla of British folks bringing 'round their yachts and other boats, is told from the standpoint of what the soldiers endured before the rescue. One thing they endured was bombing by certain aircraft. These planes had camouflage and big red circles on them; I thought they were Japanese! Very confusing!! When I see big red dots on planes I don't think Germany, do you? This film is not entertaining and it is not educational. It was chaotic, noisy, violent and boring."
300," Enormous Disappointment
","I have been a fan of Christopher Nolan since I saw ""Memento"", and Cillian Murphy is good in everything he does, so I was really looking forward to this film. What an enormous disappointment.I have to wonder why film critics are doing an ecstatic dance over it; being Christopher Nolan does not give you an automatic pass to having your film considered great. This is the worst movie I've seen in quite a while, regardless of director.What the film presents is about a half dozen sub stories but with no simultaneous time frame; it hops from one scene to the next with no continuity. Nowhere are we able to make an emotional connection with the characters, which is really the key to a fine film. It was simply a collage of well acted scenes about war thrown together into one huge mess. Maybe Nolan felt he was unable to due justice to those who so courageously stood at Dunkirk without bringing in sub stories. He should have found a better film editor to attempt to tie it all together."
301," The importance of sound.
","I won't judge the film based on the cinematography nor the editing nor the scenario. I actually learned a lot with this movie about the importance of sound. In cinema, and for those who know know how the production of movies works out there, we know that the sound department is a class apart. The first ready to shoot, the least important department during the shooting because anyways, in post-production it will be resolved, right?This is where Nolan missed it badly and sunk the movie like one of the ships. I sincerely have no idea how the producers let Cristopher Nolan get away with this. Usually the Nolan's movies are so weird in a way that catches people''s attention that they don't pay attention to the plot holes because the atmosphere that are created are so immersive that we don't care. Dunkirk is not one of his usual movies where the story itself is an unknown with surprises that keeps you on the edge of the seat. Dunkirk is more of a trying to be contemplative like Malick's war movie, and stressful like a Spielberg's war movie. He tried to stay in between the two keeping his overwhelming sound that literally turns off the immersion. He tries so hard to create an atmosphere, that you begin to wonder if he even trust the images he is filming.The amount of sound in every moment of the film tries so hard to keep you there, that you ask yourself if why not a simple moment of silence could not do the job.Nolan's team of sound design and mix failed to create an immersive experience (I saw it on IMAX) that made me always stay away of the movie and made me realize the lack of depth in the movie. It's not a ""war movie"", it's a ""survival movie"" and the bad sound editing and mixing makes it none of both. There are some many specific moments that we could discuss (the soldiers in the boat for example) but the main idea is this: I will listen to all movie that are nominated to the Oscars in best sound editing and sound mixing. Nolan and his team failed so bad that we should take a moment to appreciate how hard is the job of the sound department and how precious is a moment of silence."
302," Underwhelming and Uninspiring Attempt
","The best war films have one major thing in common: they focus on the people rather than the events. If you shuttle us from one event to another without focusing on the people, then the attempt is hollow and shallow. Unfortunately, this is the type of film that Nolan gives us. He moves us from one area with hardly any characterization at all. So why should we be emotionally vested? I had my doubts as well when this movie was given a PG-13 rating. The best war films of the past forty years or so have all be R-rated films. Storytellers and filmmakers know not to hold back on the horrors of war. Veterans of Dunkirk speak of how it was like being in hell. We don't feel that nearly poignantly enough. Dunkirk was an event that saw over 800 ships involved in the rescue as well as several hundred British aircraft (not the lone three that we see in the film), of which approximately 177 were lost. Furthermore, the combined efforts of the British/French troops holding off the Germans in the various towns isn't even addressed except for a couple of minutes during the opening scenes. Dunkirk should have been a 3-hour film, encompassing the entire theater that was Dunkirk, with focus on characters in various places to give us the sense of the desperation of what the Battle of Dunkirk was all about. Instead, Nolan chooses to only focus on small aspects of the battle without giving us much substance at all.The pulsing music ultimately fails as well, utilizing a similar style as the one used to introduce the Joker in Dark Knight. Except, instead of using it for ten minutes to increase the intensity, it's used throughout the entire film! Ultimately, because of its overuse, the music loses its power and effectiveness and ends up becoming just annoying. Despite its glaring flaws, the cinematography is very well done. The air combat scenes were impressive, as three planes do their best to protect the boats and ships attempting the rescue. Historically, 243 ships were sunk. A prime opportunity should have been utilized to really get a feel for these civilians trying desperately to cross the channel. Instead, we get a wasted effort.I could easily list over twenty war films that are far superior to Dunkirk. And given that it was one of the pivotal events of World War II, it should have been given the respect that its veterans deserve. The movie lacks cohesiveness as well as emotion. Nolan should refrain from doing another war film. Not only did he fail to utilize characters as the focal points, he failed historically as well, which is nearly a crime in and of itself."
303," A Technically Interesting Failure
","Saw it this weekend and thought it clever and well done but ultimately uninvolving despite the high level of tension it keeps up. I think it was overpraised by critics who admire Nolan as a technician, and I'd give it no more than a 6/10. It was interesting to see how Nolan converged the three time lines on a single point, but the dynamic in each timeline was very different. The one hour RAF timeline with Tom Hardy was pure action. Hardy's character makes two moral decisions, one quite unexpected, but you have to pay close attention to see them. Since I get chills whenever I see footage of a Spitfire, which Mark Rylance's character rightly calls the most beautiful airplane ever built, I was fully involved, but this action sequence didn't have the weight to carry one third of the movie. See Messerschmitt, dodge Messerschmitt, shoot Messerschmitt, da capo al fine.The most conventional segment, with the most character realization, was the one day timeline with Mark Rylance as a civilian pleasure boat owner displaying middle class stiff upper lip. His reasons aren't fully disclosed until the end, and there's a coda that, in the light of hindsight, gives you the difference between what happened and how it was reported and passed into memory. More I can't disclose without a spoiler.The one week timeline involving the troops on the beach is a failure. There simply wasn't enough social interaction among the men for the audience to relate to them as individuals or to their experience. Inarticulate fear will only take you so far, and that's all Nolan had to offer with the squaddies. It would have been more effective if ""Tommy,"" whose name we never hear, were part of a small unit instead of a lone straggler-fugitive trying to attach himself to others. Then there might have been some grumbling, some mordant humor, some defeatism, or some other character developing conversation among people who already knew and trusted one another. Not here. Kenneth Branagh's character was a very heavy-handed Basil Exposition and nothing more. Nolan uses him to give a data dump and then ignores him till the next data dump is needed to orient the audience.Apparently Nolan finds the prospect of drowning while trapped under water to be particularly horrifying. He returns to that situation several times, in different settings and from different viewpoints. This contrasts with the complete absence of realistic wounds from the bombing; in that respect, the picture is as sanitized as a 1950s war movie. There are a few good throwaway lines. One that sticks in the mind is that as Tommy makes his way through a French barricade towards the beach, one of the French soldiers mordantly wishes him bon voyage."
304," Its a NO for me.
","Its a Big NO for me. I think its a boring movie. I'm very disappointed. Many times are very confusing in time and place. I expect much more after i saw the trailer. I payed $5 for the ticket so i can really complain, but i did not like it at all. I was expecting a good war movie and good fights. The story it self is good the movie is not."
305," Good subject idea, really mediocre result
","It is worth a look. The subject had all sorts of potential. The production and photography is generally well done. Unfortunately, it just really doesn't work. It apparently attempted to isolate on a couple individual story lines, but the characters are for the most part very poorly developed. Mark Rylance/Mr. Dawson/Father/Boat Captain was pretty much the only character that was developed enough to hold any interest. Tip for Producers/Directors: If you get Kenneth Branagh for your movie, use him one hell of a lot more and better than they did in ""Dunkirk."" No one else was developed enough to be of any real interest. Furthermore, I didn't think the movie did a very good job of showing either how desperate the situation was for the soldiers stranded there or the magnitude and difficulty of the evacuation. Near the end, it is like a ""oh yeah, here comes the Cavalry"" with some rote shots of some smaller vessels coming to evacuate. Perhaps my expectations were too high, but I was distinctly dissatisfied with this movie. Not a horrible movie, but definitely one I found disappointing."
306," good movie but way over-hyped
","When a director as renowned for his storytelling and directional ability like Nolan makes a movie everyone expects nothing but gold. Dunkrik is good movie and has some great parts to it. however i really do not understand why people are considering it in par his other movies like the prestige or the dark knight trilogy let alone inception. The story is seriously lacklustre and while has a really good starting and parts in between; it left me with a sense of more to be desired. the acting is very mediocre....and when it all does come together the only thing which holds it by the end is the amazing score by Zimmer. it lacks the meat, sauce and is dry in the core. the same scenes of the bombers dropping bombs on destroyers are played over and over again like clockwork. I hope people do not go with a real high expectation because if you are nolan fan or of good war movies like the thin red line, Saving private ryan or band of brothers you will be disappointed"
307," Awful
","Worst war film in a long time. What this movie had to do with Dunkirk is a mystery to me. It was basically a series of battles ranging from air battles to sea battles to shore battles. It could have been titled anything for all it had to do with Dunkirk. Dunkirk was just a convenient background for your typical war movie. Also, how come it was nighttime in Dunkirk when it was daytime in the channel? And how was the dead stick spitfire able to fly for what seemed like an hour before landing? The dialog was almost incoherent o many occasions. Don't waste your money on this dud."
308," If you want to damage your hearing go to this movie
","We went to a Imax screening of this movie, it was so loud that it has damaged my hearing as well as that of my partners. If you go to this movie bring ear plugs. The story line was boring and the characters are very shallow. The music sounded like a steam engine running throughout the movie."
309," disappointing
","As all other people i wanted to see this so called great movie. I went with my oldest son who as limited knowledge of Dunkirk and ww2. I know quiet a bit about this time period and was expecting a lot, however my expectations were too high as there were just too many things that spoiled the movie for me. Everyone who has seen Dunkirk pictures and movies from around that time period knows what i mean. let me give you few examples, - the only Germans you vaguely see are at the end - the view from the sea to the city and in the opening shows an intact undamaged city, while in 1940 the city was destroyed, it looks more like a holiday resort. - the beached were filled with cars, equipment and most of all soldiers of all nationalities, English, french belgiums and yes also dutch. - you only see few small ships, while there were more than 30 dutch fishing ships for example than the shot at the end with the spit, not to forget the skies at that time in 1940 were filled with German planes and not the few you see in the movie the effect is soo poorly done that its just disappointing. but most of all were were the German soldiers? So i left with a feeling like is this what everyone is to enthusiast about ? the more think about it the more i see that it was a waist of money and the beach view really did it for me, it spoiled everything. Dunkirk was not a pleasure resort but a destroyed city with dozens of corpses and equipment's on the beach. They should have altered it with the computer to make it more realistic.So if you now a wee bit of that time period than don't go, you will e disappointed."
310," Dunkirk another hyped movie ""Spoilers"" and ""Review""
","This film had too much hype before playing in the theaters for what I seen, if you had to compare war films from the past for example; Saving Private Ryan, Band of Brothers film series, even The film ""fury"", blows ""Dunkirk"" out of the water literally and figuratively. How can you have 400,000 soldiers on the beach, and not have them do nothing but dodge incoming bombs, and then just stand there and do nothing while staring up in the sky for the next bomb to drop, plus the film had no film shots of the enemy ""Germany"" but of a couple of scenes of the enemy air planes being shot down, also in the film were a submarine ""U-70"" from the enemy torpedoing rescue ship escaping Dunkirk, the submarine was never seen in the in the film but you do see a silhouetting torpedo under water from an aerial view heading towards England naval rescue ships. too many mistakes were made by the director and production here . No war scenes really? 400,000 troops on the beach and no action and where were the french army? 2 stars at best"
311," Critics must've been paid big time... Giant disappointment
","I have no idea why critics seem to enjoy this movie and I have no clue how this has an 8.5/10 (at the time of writing) on IMDb. I hope this is eventually corrected upon DVD release. This movie did have fantastic visuals and amazing sound, but I don't go to movies just for that. I need some sort of character development, which this movie offered none. The characters also looked very similar, so you tend to get confused at times. They try to get you to care if someone dies, but you just aren't attached to them so you won't care if they do die. They also talk about grand scale, but there is no grand scale here. Now, I know very little about Dunkirk, but I'm pretty sure there were hundreds of thousands of people. This film seems so small compared to that number.I get that the film maker wanted to put you at the center of the action to appreciate the grand scale, but it doesn't seem to work here. You may as well play a WWII video game instead of watching this movie. Honestly, this would've been better if it were a History Documentary instead. At least in that case, you would've learned a lot more with awesome visuals. Joking aside, I've actually never been so close to walking out halfway through a movie before. You will leave underwhelmed, or in my case, I was angry that I got duped by the critics."
312," Disappointing
","My wife and I both came away from this film very disappointed. The great critical acclaim did indeed elevate our expectations but the movie just had no depth to it. There were no plot twists, no character development, and there was an incessant dramatic music score throughout the entire movie. It's like hearing the Jaws music for two hours. It simply lost all effect.Kenneth Branagh is the postcard for the overacting, pompous British thespian and he stands on a dock for the entirety of the movie in a Captain Crunch uniform filling the role to a ""T"". A good amount of other cheese was layered throughout the movie.The movie was bereft of heroism save for Tom Hardy's character and a few other spots. It's not a bad movie, but it's certainly not a great movie. Certainly not one you would go back and watch again."
313," An emotional trip back in time.
","Ever since I was a child, I always felt attracted to history and specially to World War II, which is why I was on he first line to see this movie once it opened on my local cinema. After seen the movie, I have to tell that somehow Dunkirk felt different from all the other movies I have seen related to WWII. It might be the non linear narrative, or the fact that the movie depicts the struggle of more than 300k young soldiers trying to save their lives and by doing so becoming seating ducks to the German army. Even if this event can not be consider a battle victory, because they were fleeing away from he front. It is one of the most inspiring moments of WWII for the English people, were they realized that the impossible can be done and from that moment on, things started to change at least on the psyche of the common people and specially the soldiers. War movies based on real events, are always brutal and they usually leave you with harsh feelings and empathy thoughts about how it really was to be in the character shoes. A must see movie, Mr. Nolan did it again."
314," Less than the sum of its parts.
","If you have seen many Nolan films I feel you already expect a certain style of product walking into this film. I think it fulfills expectations there.Great production values. Great actors making the most of what they have to play with. Great visuals and cgi. Tense atmospheric score and sound effects.Sadly it doesn't really come together as a whole package. My opinion is there has been a steady downward trend in Nolan films since Inception (with the exception of The Dark Knight which was only elevated by Heath Ledger's epic performance). This film fits right in that trend.IMO, many directors given the elements here would be able to craft a better film. Can't give it more than half marks."
315," Gripping or silly !! I can't decide
","I cannot make up my mind on this one. I loved the complexity of the three time strands. I liked the pacing and the use of music to create the threatening atmosphere. In principle the idea is neat - there are so many men on the beach that giving a few of them a starring role and back story serves to understate the sheer mass of human suffering and terror being experienced during Dunkirk by everyone there, so the ensemble cast idea is a good one. In reality though everyone has a back story and the film tradition of picking one or two of those out and providing more rounded characters works well in those circumstances because the audience can empathise, as it is, here we have an ensemble caste with a couple of not very well picked out individual characters that is hard to care too much about. The film is a kind of half way house - a bit of a war movie, with a few superheros. You can tell it is made by someone more used to the fantasy figure genre. The characters that have been picked out behaving like comic book heroes in terms of the scrapes they get into and how they get out of them, with true Hollywood cliff hanging moments.The movie is also curiously ""unviolent"" as it made for audience under 12. the beach scenes severely understate the brutality of the situation and the horror of war. The explosions were rather anodyne - Bodies being blown up on beaches but no discernible injuries afterwards.I also thought the scenes on the beach looked rather sparse - for what was supposed to be 300,000 men. Showing this from the perspective of the men on the beach without actually seeing the enemy works well but the actual terror of being on the beach does not come across that well especially when the beaches are both so empty and so orderly. The ending is weak and very ""Hollywood "" unrealistic and happens abruptly - almost as if the money ran out There are a few "" laugh out loud "" moments from a British sceptic - where someone gets saved at the final moment - true typical Hollywood super hero stuff - not really fitting for a war movie - where such moments probably didn't happen- people just died. The story ark in the boat probably works best, but that is because it reverts to the tradition of finding characters one can empathise with, though even here rather too comic book for my tastes.Overall I enjoyed the movie and I found it absorbing, but I don't think its a war masterpiece."
316," disappointment
","Christopher Nolan is undoubtedly my favorite director since memento. There was so much hype in this movie that i had a pretty high expectation (also just because of his name), I regret to say I didn't enjoy the movie as much as his previous movies. I actually can't feel much emotion in this movie like I did in his other work (I was teary in both inception and interstellar) Maybe because I'm not too familiar with the story (but I did research the whole Dunkirk evacuation before I went to see the movie)I can only say i'm very disappointed and first time in any of his movie i kept wondering when it would finish. If he has to make a war movie in order to get his elusive Oscar, so be it and I hope he wins it because he totally deserves one. But my vote would still go to inception."
317," Not the best war movie
","Honestly I refrain from writing bad reviews about a film because I know how much effort goes into making one but this was so disappointing specially coming from Nolan. The film script seemed biased and more of paid publicity for British army. It doesn't make you feel anything in fact it was really hard to concentrate, after every 10 minutes I was literally waiting for something wow to come up which obviously didn't happened. It nowhere shows a genius escape or struggles of a war, just some men swaying from one place to another.The actors lacked intensity, no characters were established it seemed like the writer didn't have any focus or vision for the film. The only thing we can appreciate is the technicality of cinema specially aerial cinematography other than that the story or the presentation doesn't touch any chords. Not the best war movie. Much hyped."
318," So & So
","The only thing that I could enjoy was that it felt like watching an old war movie. I could have understood this movie if it was shot in the 60's or 70's, back then they would have made it in the same way probably and it could turn into a classic.But with the resources given to filmmakers in 2017, this movie is just unacceptable and insults the classics with all the goofs and shortages. We don't see any German face in the movie, only their bullets.Is this really Dunkirk surrounded by Germans? No way. The city is so clean! and lastly, I really wonder how this movie holds an 8+ rating when most of the written reviews are below 5. Uncredibility for IMDb too."
319," Dunkirk, more like Dung-Crap!
","Dunkirk, more like Dung-Crap! I have no idea why this movie received good reviews. Let me start with the good. This movie looked and sounded great in I-Max, and I saw this movie on $5 Tuesday. That's the end of the good. Now to the bad. This movie had no characters. I felt zero emotional connection to anyone in this movie. I didn't care if anyone lived or died or anything. Mark Rylance's (the BFG) character was the only one who was halfway interesting. He was the only character who had a decent amount of dialogue in the film, who had a clear goal, and who made decisions. The other character that had more than 5 lines in the picture was Kenneth Branagh's. He seemed utterly pointless. It seemed like he was watching the movie, and his purpose was just to say a cheesy lines about ""Home"" every once in a while. Tom Hardy's character was boring and repetitive, only to predictably save the day in the end. Because this movie is so messed up, it is really hard to decide who the main character is, but if I had to decide, it'd be the guy we see 1st. He is very forgettable. He looks and acts almost identical to his friend and almost everyone in the whole movie. He meets his friend while he is taking a dump. This is not a joke. So the main character doesn't poop. He stops and helps his new friend bury a body. And the guy doesn't poop the whole movie. And him and his new friend just try to escape the whole movie. That leads me to my second point: there is no plot. It's just a bunch of explosions. There's more plot in a Transformers movie. 'Poop guy' and 'bury dead body guy' just go from ship to ship trying to live. By the way, the movie is almost over before 'bury dead body guy' says anything. So these guys try to live, Kenneth Branagh stands on a dock and says things that don't matter, Mark Rylance picks up survivors in his boat, and Tom Hardy shoots other planes, while in his plane, over and over and over again, while not being seen or heard. And that's your movie. I kept waiting for the opening action sequence to be over. I kept waiting for it to slow down a little and have some exposition, but it never did. It was like I missed the beginning and just tuned into the climax of a long, humorless, silent picture. That's not to say that a movie can't be action packed and be great. U-571 is an example of a nearly non- stop, action packed, WWII movie, thrill ride. U-571 managed to have memorable and distinct characters with different purposes. U-571 had a plot with a clear goal and twists and turns. If Dunkirk could've just cut out some of the unnecessary bits, like Kenneth Branagh, and had the 1st half hour be set up and character development, then it could've been really good. But as it was, I didn't care about any of it. I kept watching English soldiers die and thinking, ""I don't care. This movie didn't make me care."" As simple as the plot for Dunkirk was, the movie was really confusing. You'd think if you're going for an exciting, action thriller, that a simple linear plot would suffice. This movie jumps all over the time-line without giving any hint that it just made a jump in time. Christopher Nolan does a great job of jumping all over the time-line in his movie Memento. In Memento, he manages to keep things coherent and engaging. Not so here. This is just disappointing. The time jumping is completely unnecessary here. What little dialogue there is in this film is really hard to hear because of thick accents, loud explosions, masks over faces, and the music being really loud in the mix. With a really simple plot that is really hard to follow and characters with zero development or even distinguishing traits, I found myself in a really big struggle to care about what I was watching, even with incredible imagery and sound design. Yet, the whole time, the movie was telling me what I was watching was really exciting with it's music score. And that leads me to my last point: I hated the music. It pains me to say that because I usually love Hans Zimmer, especially under the direction of Christopher Nolan. There is virtually no melody in this score. It's relentless and annoying. I guess I can't blame Zimmer, considering he was just scoring to picture. Imagine watching The Dark Knight, but during the entire movie all you heard was The Joker's theme, non-stop. That's what it's like. The whole soundtrack may as well just be an air raid siren. And it's not just the music. The sound effects, as incredible as they were, were also loud, annoying, and relentless. At times, I found myself covering my ears. I thought, ""Why am I paying money to cover my ears? What I'm covering my ears to is what I paid for."" You know what movie is better than this: all the movies I have seen this year. Valerian and The Mummy were even better. They were at least fun. The best movie I've seen this Summer is War for the Planet of the Apes, but you really need to see all the Apes pictures to get the full enjoyment out of that one. The next best is Spider-Man: Homecoming, but maybe you're not up to date with the Marvel movies. In that case, see Wonder Woman. You don't need to see the other DC movies to enjoy that one. But what ever you do, don't see Dunkirk. I beg of you not to give that garbage your support."
320," Cold, empty and lacking scale....
","It's a visual spectacle, of that there is no doubt.However. I was left feeling empty and disappointed for these reasons:1 - The lack of all CGI ruined the film for me from the get-go. During the first beach scene's, it strikes you how 70's/80's the beach front buildings and windows are. That's because it is. It looks way more recent than wartime. It's wrong and it looks wrong. 2 - I had no sense of scale. The beaches seemed as empty as the dialogue. There were supposed to be 400,000 soldiers awaiting evacuation and many hundreds, of not several thousands of civilian boats coming across to rescue them. Watching the film felt like there were a few thousand soldiers and maybe 50-100 boats involved.3 - The whole film is devoid of much dialogue. It meant that you really didn't connect at all with any of the characters - particularly the Hardy character who did little more than look menacing with his eyes in most shots. 4 - I really didn't like the way that the story-telling dotted about, seemingly randomly at times, to tell a short and limited story from differing perspectives, in a totally non-sequential way. It made a mess of the story-telling for me. 5 - Did the Hardy character really do what he does in the film? I think not. A missed opportunity to have used this visual spectacular really hit home on what really happened, and what it was really like back in 1940 on Dunkirk beach, in the same way that the opening beach-landing scenes of Saving Private Ryan are indelibly etched into my mind as really giving a sense of visual perspective of how epicly awful it was to land on Omaha beach under enemy fire. The visuals are great. The story-telling is poor. Overall, it's not a film I'll be rushing to see again."
321," Really?
",I have to say I don't write very many reviews but this was so boring I felt the need. Critics who believe this is a great or even a good film must be under the influence of some mind altering chemicals that I obviously didn't have access to. The film drags along. I kept waiting for the great film I read about but it never happened. Everyone in the theater said the same thing. Don't waste your money or time. If you think you have to see this wait until you can rent it. You'll still get ripped off but at least you won't suffer the pain I had to.
322," Masterful cinematography
","Nolan's craftsmanship is outstanding. However, movie lacks captivating story and connection with characters. There are only few moments. Other wise, it just seemed like most expensive reenactment for documentary movie. It certainly wasn't what I am looking in fictional movies (you all do understand that this was fiction? Based on true story, yet fictional. Dunkirk happened, yet not like in this movie. It was a lot more messier and bloodier. In the end this seemed like big budget fan film for one WW2 battle). Tom Hardy's performance was very Bane-ish (after watching the movie you'll know what I mean), so if he wasn't pushed on by studio, just because movie needed big name to be in this big budget movie, then Nolan made mistake by casting him. Would be better with someone with no name (at least no name at the moment). Must admit that even I didn't like movie story wise, I admired cinematography. All shots and effects were outstanding, I wish there would be more movies like this every year. It was so nice to enjoy those practical effects. If there was CGI (there definitely was CGI in the movie), it wasn't obvious. Overall, movie felt original and fresh. It was great attempt from Nolan. Can't wait for his next movie."
323," Dunkirk...full of anachronisms
","There are major anachronisms with some of the sets used. English coastal port/Dunkirk, featuring 70s style buildings: Beach scenes with large container cranes in the back ground (did not exist in 1939): Prefab modern factories/warehousing on harbour front: The destroyer featured was 4 to 5 years too early in design: The railway scene at the end featured a BR carriage with Formica interior/trim and double glazing/safety glass. I am sure there are more issues out there which I have missed. I also felt the scale of the event was not adequately conveyed."
324," Nolan deserves an Academy Award for Best Director
","There is a folklore saying that every movie made by Christopher Nolan should win him an Oscar Best Director. But in reality this is not the case. In fact, Nolan is yet to receive an Oscar nomination for directing. To tell the truth, the Academy were seldom, if not never, in favor of a thriller, a sci-fi, or a superhero movie. Even great names like Alfred Hitchcock, Stanley Kubrick, or Ridley Scott were unable to break this unwritten rule. However, war films are different. Steven Spielberg's two Best Director awards are accomplished through movies both set in World War II. The Vietnam War Trilogy of Oliver Stone twice win him the Oscar. Obviously, Dunkirk is among the greatest war films of all time,and is absolutely no worse than names like Platoon, Born on the Fourth of July, Schindler's List, or Saving Private Ryan."

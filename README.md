The aim of this project is to provide a broad understanding on how mainstream audiovisual content is perceived by the audience on the internet. The different tasks are developed along the different Jupyter Notebooks files.

It is known that people feels more free when expressing their opinions on the social networks or virtual forums rather than expressing them face to face. It would also be a cheaper approach, both economically and energetically, for audiovisual content platforms such as Netflix to rate the success of a show or a movie by a study of this kind rather than paying for the developement and distribution of polls. In the long run this could also help in taking more voices into account when considering whether a show will continue or will be cancelled, since at the moment the platforms are putting a pause on shows that have a great and relevant response in social media. However, the methods used have to be finely tuned in order to produce the desired results.

This projects combines different parts that correspond to the different skills and topics we covered in the Web Intelligence course of the MIIS. The first idea is to detect a relevant weekly show in the Twitter platform through a topic modelling analysis and proceed to analyse the reception of said show. This analysis also contains the indirect assumption that for this show people prefer to watch it at the pace it is being released, instead of binge watching it. 

The second idea is to capture the differences in the opinions expressed regarding some mainstream movies taking into account the platform where they have been posted. 

Finally, fo the third part the main concept is to analyse how do people react to movies that contain specific knowledge, being it scientific or historical, through the correlation between the respective pageviews behaviour through time in wikipedia. This gives an idea on the the impact of the films in the search of topics related to them. For example, for the movie Tenet we wondered if people tried to understand what entropy was more often during the release of the movie. This is interesting because the choice of topics in a film or a show can have an impact on society's interests, and for that you just have to see how many more chess boards have been sold after the show The Queen's Gambit.
